- The author has experienced two major low points: surviving a deadly car accident at age 20 and going through a financial crisis with over $400,000 in debt in his 30s.

- The financial struggles and depression were more difficult for the author than the physical trauma of his car accident. After the accident, he had a strong support system caring for him. During his financial low point, he felt alone in dealing with his struggles and the stresses of daily life.

- The author's financial problems began around 2008 during the recession. His businesses became unprofitable, and he lost over half his income. He fell behind on his mortgage and became severely depressed for the first time.

- The author considers this problematic life experiences fortunate because of the lessons he learned from them. They enabled his personal growth and helped him develop the skills and mindset to succeed and create the life he wanted.

- The author shares his story to empower others to overcome their challenges and limitations to achieve more than they thought possible.

- The Miracle Morning methodology was born out of the author's desperation during his financial low point. He created it to gain control over his life again and work toward building the success he wanted.

- The Life S.A.V.E.R.S. are six practices that make up The Miracle Morning to help people achieve tremendous success and happiness.

- The Miracle Morning 30-Day Life Transformation Challenge helps cement the habits and mindset needed to achieve success in all areas of life.

- The author initially struggled in the hospital and during recovery with no support from family or friends. Life was challenging physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially. Suicidal thoughts crept into his mind.

- On the advice of a friend, the author went for a run one morning to clear his head. During the run, he had an epiphany while listening to self-development audio. He realized his level of success was limited by his personal development. He wanted a level 10 success but was only at a level 2 or 3 in personal growth.

- The author knew he had to prioritize personal development but struggled to find the time with his busy schedule. Evenings and afternoons wouldn't would need to be changed. He dreaded mornings; he realized mornings were the best time - they would motivate and energize him for the day. Despite the difficulty, he committed to waking up at 5 am for personal development.

- The author then had to determine what activities would have the biggest impact in the time available. He chose six life-changing personal development practices for 10 minutes each: meditation, affirmations, journaling, visualization, reading, and exercise. He got excited about the morning routine.

- When the alarm went off at 5 am, the author sprang out of bed, feeling invigorated like a kid on Christmas morning. At 5:05 am, he sat on his couch, excited for the first time in a while. His morning transformation began.

• The author had learned about many personal development activities but never implemented them over the years. One day, he decided to implement them, one by one.

• He started with 10 minutes of silence - meditation, breath focus. He felt calm and peaceful.

• He then read for 10 minutes from Think and Grow Rich. He picked up useful ideas and felt motivated.

• He then recited an affirmation from the book aloud. He felt empowered and wrote his claim.

• He then visualized his vision board for 10 minutes. He felt inspired.

• He then journaled, writing what he was grateful for. He felt his depression lift and felt grateful.

• Finally, he exercised by doing pushups and sit-ups, then 6 minutes of yoga. He felt energized.

• He continued this routine for weeks and woke up earlier and earlier, starting at 5 am and working down to 4 am. He felt less stressed, more focused, and happy. He saved his struggling business.

• He called this routine The Miracle Morning. He shared it with his coaching clients, spreading it to their friends and online. People posted about it on social media.

• He found a YouTube video of a stranger, Joe, promoting The Miracle Morning. Despite his initial defensiveness, he realized The Miracle Morning was life-changing and should share widely.

• In nearly five years, The Miracle Morning has become a worldwide movement helping people develop themselves daily. The author continues to get enthusiastic feedback and sees its potential to impact individuals and society positively.

• Many people now post Miracle Morning videos to spread the message. The author publishes video blogs that get thousands of views. He's honored to spread this message.

- According to studies, only about 5% of people achieve financial independence and success. The other 95% struggle in life and never reach their full potential.

- The author identifies three steps to rise above mediocrity and join the successful 5%:

1. Acknowledge the 95% reality check - Understand that most people settle for mediocrity and struggle. Commit to thinking and living differently to avoid the same fate.

2. Identify the causes of mediocrity - The leading causes are:

- Rearview mirror syndrome: Being limited by your past and thinking about your past determines your present and future. Most people replay the same limited thoughts and experiences from the past.

- Lack of vision and purpose: Not having a clear vision and purpose for your life and just going through the motions without direction.

- Lack of personal development: Not continuously improving your mind and skills through reading, learning, and growth and staying in your comfort zone.

- Poor daily habits and discipline: Lacking good habits and discipline to achieve your goals and vision. Success is built through consistent action and discipline, not motivation or inspiration alone.

3. Design and commit to your Level 10 life - Create a vision for your ideal extraordinary life. Set goals, develop good habits and discipline, and learn and grow continuously to achieve that vision. Commit fully to your purpose and potential.

- The Miracle Morning is offered as a solution and method for people to rise above mediocrity by transforming their lives through developing good daily habits and continuous self improvement. The book provides a practical blueprint for people to achieve success and purpose.

- To overcome mediocrity, stop living in the past and limiting yourself. Believe anything is possible and you can achieve it. Affirm this to yourself until you believe it.
- Most people lack a compelling purpose or reason for living. Choose a life purpose to inspire and drive you. It can be small initially, but have a sense and live by it. Your goal can evolve. Make one up - you don't have to "figure it out". A good starter purpose is "to become the best version of yourself".
- We often mistakenly think our choices and actions only affect the present moment. But they shape our identity and future. Everything you do affects the person you are becoming and the life you will have. See the big picture.
- Success requires accountability. It gives you the leverage to act and achieve results even when you don't feel like it. Most past success and order in your life came from the accountability of others (parents, teachers, bosses). Now you must hold yourself accountable to continue progressing.

- Most people grew up resisting accountability and responsibility because it was forced on them. This has led to developing of harmful habits and mindsets like laziness, avoiding responsibility, and taking shortcuts. To achieve success, we must initiate our accountability systems, like working with a coach or mentor. Studies show 95% of people need to implement what they learn with accwithlity.

- Get an accountability partner. Having someone to count on you makes you much more likely to follow through. Invite a friend or family member to join you in The Miracle Morning and be your accountability partner. You can also use online communities to find an accountability partner.

- Your circle of influence significantly impacts who you become. Spend time with positive, motivated people and their qualities will reflect onto you. Seek out people who believe in and challenge you. Ways to improve your circle of influence include:

› Join an online community like Meetup to connect with like-minded people.
› Join a business networking group.
› Students should consider joining the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.
› Join The Miracle Morning Community.

- Your success is, at most, your personal development. If you want a "Level 10" life, you must become a "Level 10" person by investing in daily self-improvement. The Miracle Morning provides time for extraordinary personal development so you can achieve your full potential.

- Most people lack a sense of urgency to improve themselves and their lives, living with a "someday" mindset. This leads to procrastination and unfulfillment. We must prioritize self-improvement and life change before life passes us by.

The overarching point is that we must prioritize accountability, self-improvement, and progress in our lives if we want to achieve and sustain success. We can change our lives by changing our daily habits and the people we spend time with.

Potential and regret:

- One of the saddest things is living with regret, knowing you could have achieved and experienced so much more.

- Today is the most important day of your life. Who you are becoming each day shapes your life. Mediocrity is accepting less from yourself than you want and deserve.

- Draw your line in the sand. Decide today to make changes to create the life you want. Commit to a level you never have before. Your life changes the day you refuse mediocrity.

- Why did you wake up today? Most wake reluctantly to an alarm because they must be somewhere or do something. They'd rather stay asleep. This sends the message you'd rather be unconscious than live fully.

- Hitting snooze is resisting your life and desire to create the life you want. It promotes negative energy and the feeling you don't want to live fully. Mornings set the tone for your day. Waking with dread continues the cycle.

- Waking with passion and purpose joins high achievers living their dreams and being happy. Change your approach to waking up to change your whole life.

- No one taught us waking with enthusiasm and purpose changes lives. Snoozing until the last moment and zoning out after work and at night won't develop you into who you need to be for health, wealth, success, and freedom.

- Live your life instead of escaping reality. Your life could be something you can't wait to experience.

- Give up who you've been for who you can become. Upgrade your life for the one you want. The Miracle Morning can give you an extraordinary life.

- How much sleep do you need? Most need 7-9 hours for health, productivity, and waking enthusiasm. Lack of sleep compromises your health, mood, and cognitive abilities. Prioritize sleep to wake up inspired.

• no set amount of sleep is ideal for everyone. The amount of sleep needed varies from person to person based on factors like age, health, genetics, lifestyle, etc. While some research links excessively long or short sleep durations to negative health outcomes, sleep needs are highly individual.

• The author argues that our beliefs and expectations about how much sleep we need significantly impact how rested we feel. We will feel tired if we tell ourselves we didn't get enough sleep. If we tell ourselves we got adequate rest, we will feel more energized. The mind-body connection means our thoughts influence our experience of reality.

• The author experimented with different amounts of sleep, from 4 to 9 hours, while changing his beliefs and expectations. When he told himself he would feel tired, he did, no matter how long he slept. When he told himself he would feel energized, he did, even on just 4-5 hours of sleep. He says we can recreate the feeling of waking up energized on Christmas morning every day by setting the right intentions and expectations.

• To make it easier to get up in the morning, the author recommends:

1. Setting positive intentions before bed about how energized you will feel in the morning. Your first thought in the morning is usually your last thought before bed.

2. Moving your alarm clock across the room so you can get out of bed to turn it off. This helps you wake up your body and mind.

3. Doing light exercises like jumping jacks when you first get out of bed. Motion creates energy and alertness.

4. Turning on bright lights to expose yourself to light that suppresses melatonin and boosts alertness.

5. Splashing your face with cold water causes an adrenaline rush that makes you feel alert and awake.

The key takeaway is that with the right mindset and routine, you can feel energized and excited to get out of bed every morning, even with little sleep. Your beliefs and expectations are more powerful than the number of hours you rest.

- Most people feel stressed, overwhelmed, frustrated, and unfulfilled despite living in prosperous times with many opportunities.
- There is a gap between our current potential and the potential we can achieve. We know what we need to do but don't take action.
- This "potential gap" varies in size for each person. It's possible to close this gap and live up to our full potential.
- Our "life situation" refers to external circumstances. Our "life" refers to our internal attributes and mindsets, which can influence our situation.
- Our life consists of our Physical, Intellectual, Emotional, and Spiritual components (P.I.E.S.).
- We can develop our P.I.E.S. to improve our "inner world" and "outer world" or life situation.
- By focusing on self-development each day, we can become a better version of ourselves and improve our life situation.

The key message is that we have control over our lives through self-development. We can close the gap between our current and potential selves by improving our P.I.E.S. - our physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual components. This will allow us to create the life situation we desire. The tools introduced in the next section are designed to help with this self-development and improve one's life.

Through daily personal development, your life will inevitably improve. By adopting practices like meditation, reflection, and deep breathing during a period of silence each morning, you can gain clarity, reduce stress, and focus on what matters. Over time, dedicating yourself to continuous self-improvement will transform you into the person you need to become to create an extraordinary life.

Here's a summary of affirmations:

• Affirmations are positive statements that can help you develop a successful mindset and belief system. They are repetitive statements that help impress your subconscious mind.

• Successful people like Muhammad Ali, Oprah, and Jim Carrey have credited positive affirmations as helping them achieve their success and wealth.

• You have an internal dialogue running through your head constantly. Most of it is unconscious and influenced by past experiences. It would help if you took control of your self-talk to make it positive and proactive.

• 80% of women and likely men have negative self-deprecating thoughts throughout the day that impact confidence and success. It would help if you replaced these with positive affirmations.

• Affirmations allow you to design your mindset to achieve your goals and take your life to the next level. If you don't choose your affirmations, you will repeat the fears and limitations of your past.

• The author first learned about affirmations from his successful friend Matt who would shout affirmations in the shower about controlling his destiny and achieving his dreams. Initially skeptical, the author saw Matt's success and gave them a try.

• The author's first experience with affirmations was to overcome his belief that he had a horrible memory after a traumatic brain injury. He created the claim, "I am letting go of the belief that I have a horrible memory" and repeated it daily. His memory started to improve.

• If affirmations could help overcome a belief based on such a dramatic life event, the author realized they could help change any limiting belief. Claims make an impression on your subconscious mind to transform your thinking and overcome limitations.

• The key is to actively choose and write your affirmations, align them with your goals, and repeat them daily, ideally out loud. They will go to work to change your mindset and help you succeed.

That covers the key highlights and takeaways on the power of affirmations to change your mindset and life. Let me know if you want me to explain anything in the summary.

The key ideas are:

1. Our programming—the beliefs and habits we develop over time—shapes our lives. We can reprogram ourselves through affirmations to overcome limitations and achieve our full potential.

2. Affirmations work by repeating messages to our subconscious mind until it accepts them as genuine. Our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors also change when we change our beliefs.

3. To create effective affirmations:

- Decide what you want in each area of your life. Visualize your ideal vision.

- Identify why those things are important to you. Connect to your deepest motivations and life purpose.

- Determine who you need to become to achieve what you want. Commit to developing those qualities and habits.

- Specify what actions you will take consistently to attain your goals. Start small and build up gradually.

- Add inspirational quotes and philosophies that will help reprogram your thinking.

4. Read your affirmations daily with emotion and purposeful physiology to maximize their impact. Review and revise them regularly as you grow. Consistency is key.

5. Affirmations, combined with the other Life S.A.V.E.R.S. practices, can transform your life by reprogramming your mindset and habits over 30 days. But it would help if you stuck with them to see lasting results.

The key takeaway is that we can reprogram ourselves through focused effort and discipline. Affirmations that clarify our deepest desires and motivations define our ideal identity and actions and repeat empowering messages can be highly effective for achieving breakthroughs in any area of life. But we must commit to them fully to experience fundamental transformation.

- Visualization, or creative visualization, generates positive results by mentally seeing specific behaviors and outcomes. Successful people and athletes frequently use it to enhance performance.

- Visions of their past failures limit most people. Visualization enables you to design a picture of your ideal future to occupy your mind.

- After reading your affirmations, sit up straight, close your eyes, breathe deeply, and visualize your ideal day, performing tasks with ease and enjoyment. For example, imagine writing with comfort and joy, free of stress and writer's block, and people loving the finished book. This motivates action and overcomes procrastination.

- Three steps for visualization:

1. Get ready: Sit straight, breathe deeply, close your eyes, and clear your mind. Play calming music (optional).

2. Visualize what you want: Forget limits and be impractical. Visualize your major goals, deepest desires, and dreams that would change your life. Involve all your senses. Fast forward to see achieving your vision. Experience how good it will feel.

3. Visualize who you need to be and what you need to do: See yourself living in alignment with who you need to be. See yourself taking necessary actions and enjoying the process, smiling and determined. Visualize others responding positively.

- Visualizing daily aligns your thoughts and feelings with your vision, maintaining motivation and overcoming obstacles like procrastination. Start with 5 minutes a day and build up.

- Creating a vision board gives you a tangible focus for your visualization. It's a poster board with images of what you want to have, who you want to become, what you want to do, where you want to live, etc. It's a fun solo or group activity.

- In summary, visualization is a robust process for programming your mind for success and making your goals and dreams a reality. Use it, along with reading affirmations, to turbocharge your progress.

• Creating a vision board is fun, but you must take action to achieve your goals. Vision boards help keep you focused and motivated, but only taking action will produce real results.

• Exercise is critical for health, energy, and success. Exercising 10-20 minutes a day can provide significant benefits. Yoga in particular benefits life's physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects. Morning exercise helps you start your day energized and focused.

• Reading books by experts in areas you want to improve is one of the fastest ways to gain knowledge and transform your life. Reading as little as ten pages daily can help you read 18 books in a year and expand your mind. Before reading, determine your purpose and how you will apply your learning. Take notes and review them regularly.

• Apply what you learn. Don't just read and forget. Take action and make positive changes. Review your notes and highlights regularly to keep lessons fresh in your mind.

• Reading, like the other Life S.A.V.E.R.S. practices, helps you achieve Level 10 success and transform your life. But you have to take action and apply what you learn.

Here is a summary of the key points:

• Scribing refers to writing, and the most beneficial form is journaling. Journaling provides many benefits, including gaining clarity, capturing ideas, reviewing lessons learned, and acknowledging your progress.

• The author struggled to journal consistently until making it a habit through The Miracle Morning routine. After a year of journaling daily, reviewing his journals provided many insights and a more profound gratitude for how far he had come.

• Identifying lessons learned and making new commitments based on those lessons aided the author's growth tremendously.

• Most people have "gap-focus," focusing on the gap between where they are and where they want to be. This can be detrimental to confidence and self-image. However, gap-focus can also be productive if it comes from a positive perspective and drives progress.

• The most successful people balance gap-focus with gratitude for what they have already accomplished. They focus on progress, not perfection.

• Questions to ask yourself to determine if your gap-focus is helpful or harmful:

- Do you often feel like you're not good enough or haven't accomplished enough?
- Do you minimize your achievements and beat yourself up over imperfections?
- Or do you feel motivated by your progress and the potential ahead of you?

• To cultivate a positive gap-focus:

- Acknowledge and appreciate what you have already achieved
- Focus on progress, not perfection
- Feel motivated and excited by your potential and growth ahead
- Take pride in stepping outside your comfort zone and developing new skills

• The Life S.A.V.E.R.S. practices help close the gap between your current reality and your full potential in a balanced, sustainable way. But also remember to appreciate how far you've come.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key highlights from the reading? Let me know if you wantwant me to clarify or expand on any summary part.

• The Miracle Morning can be customized to as short as 6 minutes a day for when you're pressed for time. This is called The 6-Minute Miracle Morning.

• Most people are too busy being busy to focus on the things that make them happy. It's essential to make time for self-development and personal growth.

• The 6-Minute Miracle Morning includes:

1. Silence: 1 minute of silence to focus your mind.

2. Affirmations: 30 seconds affirming what you want to accomplish that day.

3. Visualization: 30 seconds visualizing your day going perfectly.

4. Exercise: 2 minutes of light exercise like jumping jacks to wake up your body and mind.

5. Reading: 1 minute of reading something motivational or inspiring.

6. Scribing: 30 seconds of journaling to help clarify your thoughts.

• Even though 6 minutes seems short, minor improvements over time can lead to massive results and changes in your life. Start with just 6 minutes daily and build from there as you can.

• The 6-Minute Miracle Morning can be used on extra busy days or for those who feel overwhelmed at adding another thing to their daily routine. It's a way to start small but start taking action.

• Consistency is key. Keep practicing The Miracle Morning, even in its 6-minute form, to make continual progress. Start today and build from there.

- The Miracle Morning is customizable. You can adjust the wake-up time, duration, activities, and order to fit your lifestyle and goals.

- For some, the ideal time may be something other than the morning. Choose a time that works with your unique schedule and lifestyle. The key is simply waking up earlier than usual to focus on self-improvement.

- It's best to eat after your Miracle Morning when possible. If you eat beforehand, choose a light, easy-to-digest meal like fruit or a smoothie.

- Consider why you choose your foods and aim to value health and energy as much as taste. Choose more foods that provide sustained energy and health benefits and taste good.

- Drink a glass of water upon waking to rehydrate. You can also enjoy tea, coffee, or a smoothie. A smoothie with protein, antioxidants, omega-3s and various superfoods provides complete nutrition.

- Align your Miracle Morning with your major life goals and dreams. Visualize achieving them during your visualization time. Review your life vision and long-term goals. Take action toward them each day.

- On weekends, you can shorten or skip your Miracle Morning. Or, use it as an opportunity to recharge by adding extra visualization, meditation, or silent time. Make it a rejuvenating mini-retreat.

- Start your day with the most important or meaningful activity to overcome procrastination. Get it done before distraction arises. Build momentum and motivation to continue being productive. A strong start creates discipline.

The key is to make The Miracle Morning work for your unique circumstances and needs. Customize it so you look forward to practicing it daily as a period of rejuvenation and progress. It should energize you and propel you closer to your goals and the life you want.

• Chia seeds are rich in nutrients like protein, fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and various antioxidants.

• Chia seeds are a good source of nutrients that can improve heart health and reduce the risk of heart disease. They contain antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, protein, and minerals.

• Chia seeds may help reduce appetite and food intake. They are high in fiber and protein, making you feel full and reducing your needs. This may aid weight loss.

• Chia seeds contain fiber which reduces appetite by slowing the digestion and absorption of nutrients. This leads to feeling full for longer and eating fewer calories.

• The protein in chia seeds may also help reduce appetite. Protein influences hormones that control hunger and satiety. Eating protein with meals can make you feel full and eat fewer calories.

• Several studies show that chia seeds may have appetite-reducing effects and can aid weight loss when consumed regularly. However, more studies are needed to confirm these effects.

• In summary, chia seeds are a nutritious pseudo-grain with properties that may help reduce appetite and aid weight loss. They are high in nutrients like fiber, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids which have been shown to increase satiety and reduce calorie intake. Though limited, some studies support chia seeds' appetite and weight loss effects. Including chia seeds in your diet may help you eat fewer calories and achieve weight loss goals.

It isn't easy to implement and sustain new habits because:

1. We are addicted to our old habits. Our habits, good or bad, have been reinforced over time through repetition. It is hard to break the cycle.

2. We need an effective strategy. Most people need to learn what it takes to change a habit and are unprepared for the challenges. They end up giving up quickly.

3. The process of change is painful. Creating a new habit or breaking an old one is challenging, especially at first. There are three phases:

- Days 1-10 (Unbearable): This initial phase is difficult and uncomfortable. Most people quit here due to the discomfort. But if you know it's temporary, you can push through.

- Days 11-20 (Uncomfortable): It gets more accessible but still requires discipline. The temptation to revert to old ways is vital. Stay committed.

- Days 21-30 (Unstoppable): This is when the real transformation happens. The new habit becomes part of your identity. But many quit too soon, right when it's getting good. These final days are key to sustaining long-term change.

4. Our mindset and beliefs hold us back. We tend to believe we "can't" do something or that it's impossible. This prevents us from trying or causes us to quit at the first sign of difficulty. We have to overcome these limiting beliefs.

5. We need more motivation and accountability. For many, the "why" behind the new habit and having a solid support system in place are missing. This makes the practice much harder to stick to long-term.

The key is to go in with the right mindset and strategy, prepare for the discomfort, push through the initial pain period, reinforce the habit during the final stretch, and stay accountable and motivated. You can change any pattern and achieve what you want if you do. But it would help if you committed to the long haul. There are no shortcuts.

Here's a summary:

The author decided to train for and run a marathon despite believing he was "not a runner." The first ten days of running were painful and challenging, but he stuck with it through dedication and commitment. Days 11 through 20 got slightly more accessible, and he started forming the habit of running daily. By days 21 through 30, running had become almost enjoyable. In just 30 days, he overcame his limiting belief and became a runner.

After 30 days and 50 miles of running, a friend challenged him to run an ultra-marathon of 52 miles. He accepted and trained for six months. He found 3 others to join him, and they ran the 52 miles together, finishing in 15.5 hours. Crossing the finish line gave them freedom from their self-imposed limitations and self-doubt.

The author says this freedom is available to anyone who pushes out of their comfort zone and takes on new challenges. The Miracle Morning 30-Day Life Transformation Challenge can provide this freedom by helping you form new habits and overcome limitations.
