 Here's a summary of the table of contents:

Preface: The book is written as a conversation between the authors and the reader. The key to success is honest communication between you and your customers.

Chapter 1: You can build a substantial income online in bits of spare time, but you have to ignore a lot of conventional wisdom. There are 10 false barriers to overcome:

1. Age - Buyers online don't care about your age. 
2. Lack of money - You can build a website for under $100 and create products cheaply.
3. Lack of time - You only need scraps of time here and there. You don't need a second job.

Chapter 2: Quickly create a profitable product. Typical dreams are useless. Create a product based on: rabid hobbyists, proven examples, or appealing to hobbyists. Avoid pitfalls and get feedback.

Chapter 3: Create content cheaply and easily in three stages: capture raw content, edit it, and deliver it. Use continuity and be an opportunity engineer.

Chapter 4: Build a good website with 7 basic building blocks. Outsource work. 

Chapter 5: Attract people to raise their hands and opt into your list. Debunk 4 myths about traffic, targeted traffic, waiting for a "game changer," and cost per lead. Discuss the parts of lead generation and sources for leads.

Chapter 6: Turn prospects into buyers. Avoid 7 mistakes like confusing attention with shouting, exaggerated claims, self-centered marketing, asking for the sale too soon, missing a call to action, fake deadlines, and speaking to audiences not individuals. Answer the 8 money questions to sell your product.

Chapter 7: Build profitable relationships through email and other contact. Use autoresponders, not just broadcast emails. Follow 4 tips for building relationships by email. Stay in contact other ways too.

Chapter 8: Create an upward profit spiral. Install measuring devices, determine why non-buyers don't buy and adjust, and test everything.  

Chapter 9: The "I" factor - Believe in yourself and your ability to succeed.

Index

 

Myth 1: It's a bad economy. While there is unemployment, 80% of people are still employed and buying things. There are many microeconomies and opportunities if you know where to look. 

Myth 2: All the good ideas are taken. This is not true. People are constantly coming up with new ideas and inventions. Even if not, people collect multiple of the same types of items and are always interested in the next new thing, especially for their hobbies and passions.

Myth 3: I'm too small to compete with big companies. Nowadays, small is the new big. It's much easier for small companies to reach customers and build a business. Big, established companies are often slow and inefficient, leaving room for agile small businesses.

Myth 4: I'm not good with computers. You don't need advanced computer skills to build an online business. You simply need to be able to use basic tools like a web browser, text editor, and email.

Myth 5: There's too much competition. It's better to enter an established market where demand already exists. Your competition is often inefficient, leaving room for a company with good customer service and products. Focus on revenue growth, not being a pioneer.

Myth 6: I'm not educated enough. Your education and background don't matter for building an online business. Customers only care about whether you can provide value.

Myth 7: Someone will steal my idea. It's better to launch an imperfect product and start making money than keep an idea trapped in your head. If you're first to market, you'll be remembered as the pioneer. You can out-innovate copycats. 

Real Danger 1: You listen to unsuccessful people. Don't take advice from people who mean well but aren't successful themselves. Follow the lead of people who have actually achieved what you want to achieve.

 

- Uncle Moe sees things in black and white. He is either completely for or against something. 
- His advice over the years has been questionable because he himself has not been very successful. He has had many failed business attempts and blames external factors for his lack of success.
- Given Uncle Moe's lack of success, you should take his advice with a grain of salt. It is better to avoid telling him about new ideas or plans and instead discuss neutral topics. New ideas are fragile and need nurturing, not criticism.
- Danger #2 is thinking you can make money without effort. Advertisements often promise unrealistic instant results but real success takes work. 
- Danger #3 is thinking that the only good money is hard-earned money. While hard work is admirable, passive income streams that generate money over time with little ongoing effort are also legitimate. 
- Danger #4 is insisting on staying in your comfort zone. Some discomfort is necessary for growth and success. You don't need to take big risks but you do need to stretch yourself.
- Danger #5 is thinking "my situation is different." It is easy to come up with excuses for why advice, methods, or success stories won't work for you based on perceived differences. In reality, there are more similarities than differences for most people. Excuses are a way of avoiding taking action.

The key takeaways are:
1) Consider the source of advice and take it with a grain of salt if the person giving it is not successful themselves. 
2) Real success takes work. There are no shortcuts. 
3) Passive income streams that generate money over time are legitimate ways to build wealth.
4) Growth requires stretching yourself and facing discomfort. Make small improvements over time.  
5) Avoid excuses and recognize that methods for building success will likely work for you too despite perceived differences. Take action instead of finding reasons why you are different.

 

Most people have highly developed excuse generators that prevent them from seeing opportunities. The author encourages the reader to ignore these mental barriers and look for ways to make ideas work. Success often comes from adapting existing ideas or stumbling upon discoveries, like vulcanized rubber or Post-it notes. 

Rather than chasing "the next big thing," the author recommends taking a steady, incremental approach to building income, like a beaver constructing a dam. New technologies or methods should be incorporated gradually into what you already have, not treated as silver bullets.

The story of inventors pitching products on Pitchmen illustrates the slim chances of success and high costs of the typical "invent and market a product" dream. The odds are stacked against people in this approach:

•They spend years and money developing a product with no income.

•They spend more money on legal protections with no guarantee of success.

•Their pitch has a low chance of interesting the show's stars. 

•Even if chosen for the show, the chance of profitability is small.

•They usually have to give up most of the potential profits to the show's producers.

Rather than this risky approach, the author recommends an alternative method for building a second income through selling a product. The typical "invent and market a product" dream will likely not work. But with the right mindset and systematic process, creating and selling a product can generate income.

 Here’s a summary:

The conventional dream of making it big with an invention is unrealistic. There are six requirements that make this approach very difficult:

1. Need fortress to protect idea 
2. Must reach millions of people
3. Want to be famous   
4. Want to be rich from first invention  
5. Need revolutionary invention
6. Inventions are made in factories

These requirements are very hard to meet. A better approach is to create an information product. Compared to physical products, info products:

- Take less time to create and sell 
- Are hard for others to steal
- Are easy to create new versions of 
- Have high profit margins 
- Are more likely to succeed for first-timers  
- Provide a sense of accomplishment with less prestige

To create an info product, identify:

1. A problem you've solved: Solve a frustration you or someone you know has experienced. 

2. Something you can demonstrate: Show how to do something people are interested in, like a hobby or tech skill. These types of products can sell well even if the topic seems obscure or unimportant.

The key is to start small and build up from there. A $7 product may not make you rich but can provide income to combine into bigger streams over time. Success comes from volume and persistence, not just one big win.

 

The author discusses several examples of people making money by writing about their experiences or areas of interest, even if they are not experts. Some examples include:

- A man who made a fortune selling a kidney stone remedy online, even though he has no medical background. He found that people with kidney stones are highly motivated to find solutions and are open to folk remedies. 

- Reports on things like uses for cider vinegar or hydrogen peroxide. The authors compile information from various sources into their own reports. These types of practical, solution-focused reports appeal to many readers.

- A graduate student who makes six figures selling photographs he takes in his spare time. He uploads thousands of photos to microstock agencies, who sell the photos for very little and give the photographer a small royalty. But the volume of sales adds up. 

- A man who assembled information on how to erase one's digital footprint after his family was the victim of a home invasion. He is now able to sell this knowledge to others concerned about their privacy and security. 

The key is finding areas of interest or experience that provide value to readers. With some research, the information can be compiled into short reports, ebooks, online courses, and more. Length and expertise are not as important as practical, useful information and solutions. By tapping into topics that motivate readers, like health conditions, hobbies, security concerns, money-making opportunities, and so on, ordinary people can find ways to generate income from their knowledge and interests.

The overall message is that you don't have to be an expert or have specialized expertise to make money writing and publishing information. With some research and work, you can compile valuable resources on a wide range of topics that appeal to motivated readers and customers. The key is to get started - pick some areas of interest and start researching and compiling the information. You can then turn that into products to sell online.

 

- Joomla, a popular content management system, can be frustrating to install without help. The author found a video tutorial for $59 that made the installation much easier. 
- The creator of the video likely made thousands of dollars in profit from a few hours of work. This shows the potential for making money by creating products that help people with specific needs.
- There are many opportunities for creating tutorial products. Examples include videos for helping people use features on sewing machines, boat motors, bread machines, etc. These kinds of highly targeted products can rank well in search and be very profitable.
- You don’t have to create completely new products. You can put a new spin on existing topics or products. For example, creating a guide focused on organic tomato gardening, common mistakes in real estate investing, testing and comparing different reel mowers, etc. 
- You can appeal to avid hobbyists or collectors by creating products targeted to their interests. Websites like Meetup show there are many active communities around all kinds of topics.

The key message is that you can build a profitable business by identifying people’s frustrations and needs—especially those with specific interests—and creating products, video tutorials, reports, etc. to address those needs. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Putting a new, focused spin on an existing topic or product can be very effective. And appealing to dedicated hobbyists and collectors is a great way to find an eager audience.

 Here's a summary:

- Look for groups or people interested in the topic you want to research. Interview them to gain insights. 

- Consider creating a report on "How to Make Money with Your Tomato Gardening Hobby" to sell to passionate tomato gardeners. They will buy it to justify their hobby rationally, even though they just want it emotionally. 

- You don't need special credentials or experience to create simple reports like this. The guy who created the kidney stone remedy report wasn't a doctor. 

- You don't need to reach millions of people or become famous and rich from your first product. A small, passionately interested audience is enough.

- Simple products like short reports don't require a "fortress" to protect the idea or a revolution or factory to produce. The 21st century marketplace is instant and global.

- Some marketers say to find a hot trend and create a product for it. You can use Google Trends and Google Insights for Search to find trends. However, for your first product, building on your existing knowledge may be easier.

- Avoid getting excited and creating a product before checking what's already out there. Do research to find gaps, see what's selling, and speak knowledgeably about your product. The prescription drugs example shows why.

- There are many other product idea variations, but the suggestions here should get you started. More options risk being overwhelming.

- The content creation process involves three stages: capturing raw content, editing the content, and delivering the content. 

- There are several methods for capturing raw content:

1. Sit down and write: This is a common approach. Follow six principles:

- Do not edit while writing. Let your thoughts flow freely. Edit later. 
- Do not let others see your work in progress. Share only after editing.
- Do not worry about length. You can cut or expand later. 
- Do not sweat accuracy. You can fill in facts and details later. 
- Just start writing, no matter what. If stuck, write “I don’t know what to write” until ideas start flowing.
- Create an outline. Outlines provide structure and make writing easier. Use a flexible outline that evolves as you write.

2. Have a conversation: Many people find conversation easier than writing. Use a digital audio recorder to capture a conversation about your topic. Either talk to someone else or talk out loud to yourself. Follow the same principles as writing - let your thoughts flow freely and edit later.

3. Record video: Create video content by recording an interview, presentation, or "talking head" video. Tools like Zoom, Loom, and Camtasia make recording and editing video easy.

4. Repurpose existing content: Look for relevant blog posts, videos, podcasts, or other content you have already created. Repackage and repurpose this into an info product. 

- Editing involves reviewing, reorganizing, and polishing the raw content. Get feedback from others. Refine the content and strengthen the overall product.

- Delivering the content involves choosing a format, creating covers/graphics, and distributing the content through appropriate channels. Digital delivery (ebook, video, audio) or physical products (print books, DVDs) are options.

 Here's a summary:

- Experiment with different methods of generating content until you find what works for you. It can take weeks or months.

- You have three options for using recorded audio content:
1. Listen and write down helpful sections. 
2. Use speech recognition software to transcribe. Software is getting better and more accurate.
3. Hire a transcription service. Costs between $1-2 per minute.

- Interviewing experts or frequent users is a good source of content. Be careful not to plagiarize. Quote or credit contributors. The biggest danger is someone stealing your idea, though the likelihood is small if you take precautions.

- Recording a presentation you give is an easy way to capture content. The presentation may already have a good structure you can use.

- Capturing screenshots with annotations is a helpful way to show people where to go or click. Screenshot tools like Snagit make this easy.

- Recording a video of navigating the web (a "web session") is even more helpful. Tools like Camtasia and external mics can capture your voice, mouse movements, and web pages. Editing features allow you to fix mistakes. Aim for authenticity over slick production.

- Edit your content into a coherent whole with a logical flow and structure. Aim for much more content than you need so you can pick and choose the best parts. Keep your audience and their skill level in mind. Be very explicit for beginners.

- Get feedback from real members of your audience. Incorporate their input into your editing.

- You may need to reorganize or re-record some content. That's part of the process.

- Consider hiring an editor if you need help shaping the content. They can make sure everything flows logically and coherently, especially for longer or more complex products.

Does this summary cover the key points? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 

The key points in the passage are:

1. Be careful with using too much jargon or complex information when explaining something to beginners. They can get confused and stop engaging with your content. However, for more advanced audiences, too much basic information can be boring. Match the level of detail and complexity to your target audience.

2. Have backups of your work in case anything happens to your computer. Use external storage, cloud storage, or both. Things like computer crashes, data corruption, or hardware failures can happen at any time.

3. Get feedback on your content from others before publishing it. Choose reviewers carefully. Look for people who will give you constructive feedback, not just unconditionally positive or overly critical feedback. Focus on whether the information is clear, useful, and complete. 

4. There are many ways to deliver content, including special reports, home study courses, newsletters, live events, and more. You don't have to use all of the options, just choose the ones that work for you.

5. Offering free, valuable content (like special reports) is a good way to build your audience and credibility. It shows your expertise, provides value to readers, and inspires confidence in your paid offerings. Give before you get.

6. Getting started kits, home study courses, and live events are good ways to provide comprehensive, higher-value paid content. They can incorporate content you've already created, like from teleseminars or live events. Providing a lot of content for the money is a way to show good value.

The key advice seems to be: know your audience, provide value, build credibility, and repurpose quality content into multiple forms of delivery. With the right strategy, you can make a good income from information products and online content.

 Here's a summary:

- Newsletters: Some marketers prefer short, single-page newsletters with dense content. Others like longer newsletters (12-16 pages) with less-dense content. There's no definitve answer and you should test both approaches. 

- Books: Books require a lot of work but can provide wide exposure. However, books typically don't generate much direct revenue ($25 list price) relative to the effort required. Books are good for establishing credibility and authority, but are best pursued once you've already built an audience and business. Don't view books primarily as a customer acquisition tool. Build an audience first, then use that to get a book deal.

- Interview series transcript: Conducting and selling expert interviews is a way to repurpose content into multiple formats (audio, video, transcript) and charge a premium. Different customers prefer different media. 

- Fast-start guide: Create a short guide to help customers quickly get started with your product or system. This reduces overwhelm and frustration, and makes it easy to "take the first bite." Include this with your main product.

- Pocket guide: Create a condensed, portable reference guide that allows customers to access your content on the go. Offering information in multiple formats with different use cases appeals to more customers.

- Checklist: A checklist is a highly distilled reference that tells customers exactly what to do. Checklists reduce uncertainty and ensure critical steps aren't missed. Pair longer, more descriptive content with a summary checklist. 

- T-shirt: Offering a free t-shirt or other apparel item with a purchase can make that offer more appealing. But the item should be high-quality and visually appealing, not just a promo item with your brand or URL. Use a service like 99designs to crowdsource t-shirt designs and get an affordable, custom design.

- Poster and laminated poster: Posters are an easy-to-digest information product. Free posters can capture leads; paid posters ($19-49) provide value. Poster content should be brief but actionable, leaving customers wanting more details and guiding them to your other offers.

- Calendar: Including a custom calendar with your branding in an information product subtly keeps you in front of customers all year. Calendars don't need to be expensive or high-tech to be effective.

- Game: Creating an educational game around your topic or industry can be an innovative product. While risky, games that effectively teach and engage customers can be very successful. Look for gaps in your market that a game might fill.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the passage:

15. Mug 
- Like T-shirts, attractive mugs can get people interested in your main product or service. They are an effective promotional item.

16. Information Wheel
- Also called slide charts or wheel charts, these are physical information tools that don't require batteries or technology. 
- They provide information by lining up windows or slides. Examples are wheel charts with windows that reveal information underneath when spun, or slide rules where you line up sliding cards.
- They are compelling because they are retro and nostalgic. People may show them to others. They can be an excellent bonus or standalone product.

17. CD 
- CDs are popular for info products and you can put audio or video on them. 
- Tiny or oddly shaped CDs can damage players, so stick to standard sizes. 
- Although technology has advanced, CDs still work well and some people prefer physical products. Offer CDs along with digital download options to give customers choices. Competitors likely won't offer as many choices.

18. DVD
- DVDs hold more information than CDs but fewer vehicles and homes have DVD players. 
- It's hard to watch video while driving, and many people don't want to sit and watch long videos at home. Relying solely on DVDs may not be effective.
- Offer DVD content in other formats like audio CDs, transcripts, and screenshots. This provides options for how people want to consume the information.

19. Interview Series on MP3
- You can add value to interview series by providing them in MP3, CD, and transcript formats. This gives customers options for how they prefer to learn and access the content.

20. Free Video 
- Free videos must provide valuable and entertaining content to be effective, since there are many free videos online.

21. Live Event Videos
- Selling recordings of live events risks cannibalizing live event sales. Attendees may feel ripped off if they paid much more for live access. 
- Some people will prefer live events for the experience, networking, and ability to ask questions. Recordings lack this and some people won't end up watching them.
- Only sell highlights or wait to sell full recordings until after the live events have ended. Make it clear that recordings provide less value than the live experience.

22. Toll-Free 24/7 Recorded Line
- A 24/7 recorded phone line provides information access for auditory learners and those more comfortable with phone than computers. 
- Clearly state that the line is prerecorded. Provide the number on your website, business cards, ads, etc. 
- Give good quality information on your messages. Divide content by topic or audience and provide options for people to choose what they want to hear more about. This caters to people's interests and learning preferences.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- Install sensors on garage doors to detect burglars. Sensors detect when the garage door is opened and can trigger an alarm.
- Gather information from customers based on options they select. This helps determine what products or topics they are most interested in so you can provide more details. 
- Always provide an option to speak to a live person. Some customers will want to take immediate action, so having a live person available will help capture those sales. You can hire an answering service or have people working from home handle the calls.
- Offer a consulting hotline where customers can pay for a short call with an expert. This generates revenue and provides value. You can use a service like LivePerson to find experts and handle the logistics. 
- Teleseminars and webinars are effective for building an info product business. They are inexpensive, can create an intimate experience, allow interactivity, can be replayed, and audience size is not revealed. Record and edit the call to make it evergreen.
- For webinars and teleseminars, do not open all lines so people can hear each other. This creates too much background noise and distraction. Only open lines for a Q&A portion in an organized fashion.  
- Offer trial versions of software that demonstrate the full capabilities. Customers today expect to see the complete features before paying.
- Develop mobile apps for products and services. Apps are popular and can be an inexpensive way to reach new prospects. Consider offering a free app to generate leads or charge a small fee.
- Provide software with a full guarantee in case the customer wants to return it. The trend is moving to subscription or cloud-based software rather than installed software.

 

Offering software and other digital products online (without requiring any installation on the customer's end) has many benefits:

- It avoids installation headaches and frustrations for customers. 
- It allows for quick and easy updates without shipping physical products.

Using an "involvement device" like an online calculator can increase customer engagement and sales. For example, a "What's your REAL age?" calculator that asks lifestyle questions.  Get customer contact info (email) in exchange for providing the calculator results.

Free PDFs, audio interviews, webinars, and consultations are good ways to provide value to customers before asking them to pay. They build trust and credibility.

Paid consultations, lunch/dinner seminars, one-day seminars, and "boot camps" are more advanced techniques for established businesses. They charge money but also provide a lot of value. Video recording these events allows you to repurpose content into other products. 

Live tours and cruises are immersive events for certain industries like real estate or photography. Customers get hands-on experience and access to experts. The events can incorporate presentations, networking, and opportunities to make purchases.

Continuity, or ongoing monthly payment from customers, is ideal for info-product businesses. A newsletter is one of the best ways to build continuity. It provides regular value to customers and opportunities to promote other offers. The informal, "chatty" format is appealing and helps build relationships.

In summary, the keys to success here are: providing value, building trust, engaging customers, making things as easy and frustration-free as possible, and establishing continuity and long-term relationships. Creating a variety of products at different price points gives customers options to choose from based on their needs and budget.

 

To have a successful web business, you need seven basic building blocks:

1. A good domain name:
- Stick with .com names 
- Avoid funky spellings
- Be creative to find available names

2. Professional email: 
- Use your domain name for your business email
- It looks more professional 
- It reinforces your brand

3. Web hosting:
- You need a web host to make your site accessible online
- Look for reliable, affordable options 
- Cost can range from $5 to $20+ per month

4. A simple but clean design:
- You don't need an expensive custom design
- Focus on clarity, readability and conveying your message
- Use templates or hire an affordable designer

5. High-quality content: 
- This is the most important part 
- Provide real value and useful information to your visitors
- Content should match your product or service

6. Make it easy to buy:
- Clearly show your products or services 
- Have an easy purchasing process
- Provide multiple payment options 

7. Effective traffic generation: 
- Use search engine optimization, ads, social media, etc. to drive targeted traffic 
- Relevant traffic is more valuable than volume of traffic
- Track analytics to see how people find you and buy from you

Following these seven building blocks will allow you to set up a good web business, offer value to your customers and generate revenue. While it does require work and time, it is easier than many assume if you take it step by step.

 

- Use simple, easy to remember domain names that clearly convey the topic or benefit to customers. Avoid complicated or nonsensical names. 

- Consider alternative spellings or plural/singular forms and buy those domain names or avoid using words with those variations. This prevents losing traffic to similar domain names.

- Avoid using hyphens in domain names. Hyphens can complicate explaining the domain name to others and may make it harder to remember. 

- Focus the domain name on customer benefits, not on yourself or your credentials. Customers care more about what's in it for them.

- A good technique for generating domain name options is to think of a prefix, main topic, and suffix. Then use a tool to generate all possible combinations to find available options.

- Only buy the .com version of a domain name to start. Don't worry about other extensions like .net or .tv until your product and site are established. Focus on keeping initial costs and effort low.

The summary outlines strategies for choosing a good, memorable domain name that conveys benefits to customers, tips for finding available domain names, and recommends starting with just the .com version. The key point is to keep things simple while launching an info product.

 

During the early stages of building your online business, focus on the essentials and keep costs low. Don't build an elaborate website right away. Start with reserving a simple domain name and basic web hosting. You can always improve and expand your site over time as your business grows.

Private domain name registration is unnecessary and mainly a gimmick to generate more revenue for domain registrars. It does little to actually protect you. Use a reputable and inexpensive registrar like GoDaddy.

For web hosting, avoid free options which often come with advertising or limitations. Pay a small fee, around $3/month, for reliable hosting with good customer support. You can upgrade to dedicated IP hosting later to avoid issues with shared hosting.

For your website design, you have a few options:

1. Custom design - Unnecessary and expensive for a small business. Requires programming and graphic design skills.

2. Template -  An affordable and simple option. You can customize the template and add your own text and images. No special skills required.

3. Hire a freelancer - If you want an original design, hire an affordable freelance web designer. Provide input on the overall look and feel you want.

4. Website builder tool - User-friendly tools for creating customized websites without any coding. Drag and drop features to add text, images, videos, contact forms, etc. An easy DIY option if you prefer more control over the design.

In summary, keep things simple and affordable, especially when you're first getting started. You can always make improvements over time as your business develops and revenue increases. The most important things are having an online presence, capturing visitor information, and providing value. The specific design elements are less critical.

 

You have several options for building a website for your business:

1. Hire a professional web design firm. This is expensive but gets the job done. As an alternative, you can hire freelancers to custom code a design for you for a few hundred dollars. 

2. Learn web programming yourself. This is free but time-consuming. Only do this if you enjoy it. 

3. Use a wizard-based website builder. These are inexpensive but limited in customization. They are good for quickly getting a basic site up.

4. Use an off-the-shelf template. This provides flexibility at a low cost. You can customize the template or hire a programmer to customize it for you.

To get started, you'll need:

1. An HTML editor. HTML is the main language of the web, and a free HTML editor will allow you to make basic changes to your site. The learning curve is a few hours.

2. An FTP tool. FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. You'll need an FTP tool to transfer files like audio, video, and webpages from your computer to your web host. FTP tools are inexpensive and easy to learn.

3. A way to accept payments. The easiest way is to get a PayPal account. PayPal is owned by eBay, so many customers already use it. From the customer's perspective, paying with PayPal is simple and secure. As a business, PayPal charges around 3% per transaction.

In summary, for a small investment of time and money, you can get a functional website up and running to help promote and sell your information products. The options range from mostly hands-off to very hands-on, depending on your skills and interests. But at a minimum, learn the basics of HTML and FTP, and get set up to accept payments.

 

PayPal allows customers to pay without opening a PayPal account. They can pay using credit or debit cards. PayPal charges a small fee for each transaction but makes it easy for merchants to accept payments. To use PayPal, you open an account, provide your bank account information, and PayPal verifies the account. Then you can accept payments through PayPal.

Customers often view money in their PayPal balance as “funny money” and are more willing to spend it. This is good for merchants. 

Accepting checks and money orders is easy. You just tell customers to send payment to you. However, there is more risk of fraud or non-payment.

To accept credit and debit cards directly, you need to take several steps:

1. Get a business certificate from your city. This establishes your business as legitimate.

2. Open a commercial bank account. This is like a personal account but for your business.

3. Get a merchant account. This allows you to accept card payments. You must agree to the merchant account provider's rules.

4. Get a payment gateway. This is the technology that actually processes the card payments by verifying the card, checking the billing address, and completing the transaction.

A payment gateway and merchant account, along with your business certificate and commercial bank account, allow you to accept direct credit and debit card payments on your website with more control than using a service like PayPal. However, the process of setting all of this up is more complicated than just opening a PayPal account.

In summary, PayPal provides an easy way to get started accepting payments, but getting your own merchant account and payment gateway gives you more control and options in the long run. The best approach is often to start with PayPal, then transition to your own merchant account and payment gateway once your business is established.

 

- To send commercial email, you need a commercial email account, not a personal one. Personal accounts will detect commercial email and block or ban you.

- Commercial email accounts are designed specifically for sending business email. They test your emails to determine how "spammy" they are and provide a score indicating the likelihood of the email being flagged as spam.

- Email filtering systems have become very sophisticated. They detect spam based on combinations of keywords, sending the same email to many recipients, and other factors. Trying to trick these systems by misspelling words or other techniques will likely not work and will make you appear like a spammer.

- A commercial email account is necessary to get legitimate business email delivered to recipients. They are designed specifically for this purpose, unlike personal accounts.

- Once set up, a commercial email system and the associated tools like shopping carts will run largely on autopilot. But the initial setup requires a good amount of work to get right. It's important to provide a smooth experience for customers checking out and paying. 

- Good shopping cart software allows you to upsell customers, offer them related products when they've just bought something. It also provides analytics to gain insights into your customers and sales.

- In summary, to conduct ecommerce and send commercial email, you need the proper tools and accounts designed specifically for businesses. Personal tools and attempts to workaround filters are likely to fail and damage your reputation. But with the right setup, these systems can run efficiently with little ongoing maintenance required.

 

- There are many providers of commercial email services that offer free accounts for small businesses as long as you have a limited number of emails and do not send a large volume. The downside is they may include a small promotion for their service at the bottom of your emails. However, the service is free and gets your emails delivered. You can always upgrade to a paid account as your business grows.

- Be careful choosing an email vendor. High-quality vendors strictly monitor the emails you send to build a good reputation with major email providers like Gmail and Hotmail. They ensure your emails are high-quality and not spam. While it may seem like a lot of work, it ensures your emails are delivered. Lower-quality vendors may say your emails were delivered when really they were not.

- You can create your own email addresses with your domain name, like info@yourdomain.com. You can have emails forwarded to any address you want. This allows you to create addresses like support@ or sales@ without needing to check those inboxes regularly.

- There are two ways to handle email on your website:

1. Mailto links - Uses the visitor's email system to send an email. This is unreliable since many visitors have issues with their email accounts. 

2. Web forms - The message is sent directly from your website to you. This is the preferred method.

- Consider outsourcing work to keep up with the growth of your business. Websites like 99designs, Elance, Rentacoder, and Odesk allow you to hire freelancers to help with tasks like creating new websites. You post the details of your project and freelancers will bid on the work. You can review portfolios and ratings to choose the best candidate. Money is held in an escrow account until the work is completed satisfactorily. Be very specific in your project details to get the best results.

 Here's a summary:

- It's worth going through many candidates to find the best people for the job. Be wary of very low bids, as they often indicate poor quality work. Trust your gut instinct in evaluating candidates. 

- Look for candidates with good reviews from past clients, fast turnaround, and high quality work. Offering a small initial task to compare candidates in a "horse race" can help determine the best people.

- Treat valuable team members well by being specific in your requests, communicating promptly, providing good feedback, and paying on time. Consider offering bonuses for good work. This will encourage them to be readily available for future projects.

- Don't get distracted by myths about getting leads like "it's all about traffic", "it's all about targeted traffic", or waiting for some "game changer". Traffic and social media followings alone don't equal success or income. Highly targeted traffic to your specific audience is better. Real game changers are substantive, long-lasting changes like the internet and global outsourcing—not gimmicks.

The key is focusing on real, measurable results like income and leads that can be converted to customers. The narrower you target your audience, the better. But don't get distracted chasing "silver bullet" solutions—stick to fundamentals that work.

 

Consider using new marketing techniques or “game changers” to generate leads, but don’t rely on them long-term or make them the foundation of your business. These techniques often have a short “half-life” and stop working. Some examples:

- The scammy weight-loss blog that sold supplements. It made a lot of money quickly but Google shut it down once it realized what was happening. 

- There are no single “best” lead sources for every business. The smart approach is to use many lead generation techniques, so if some stop working you have others to fall back on.

Focus on return on investment, not just cost per lead. Cheap leads are not always the most profitable. Some expensive leads can be very profitable. 

Don’t pursue prospects, attract them. It’s better to get prospects to come to you by promoting your offer, rather than constantly pitching to new people. This avoids rejection and burnout.

Give before you get. Provide value and useful information to prospects before asking them to buy. This builds trust and makes people more open to your offers.

The steps for effective online lead generation are:

1. Deliver valuable information to a highly targeted audience.

2. Direct them to a specific landing page. Don’t just send them to your general home page.

3. On the landing page, capture their information through an opt-in. Offer them more helpful information, like an ebook or checklist, in exchange for their email address. 

4. Nurture prospects through follow-up, using mail campaigns and auto-responders. Provide more value build a connection and eventually turn leads into customers.

5. Promote multiple offers. Don't rely on any single offer for all your leads. Healthy businesses have diverse sources of new customers.

6. Continually test and optimize. Try different approaches to land pages, email messaging, and offers to see what works best. Make ongoing improvements.

7. Outsource when possible. Focus your time on higher-value tasks. Use freelancers and agencies to help with technical work like copywriting, design, and implementation.

 Here is a summary of their business based on the provided information:

- Their business markets products/services through their website. 
- They have an ineffective marketing strategy where they direct visitors immediately to their homepage instead of targeted landing pages. This results in a high bounce rate as visitors cannot find what they are looking for.
- They recommend creating targeted landing pages for specific topics to provide relevant information to visitors. This helps to reinforce that visitors have come to the right place and are interested in the topic.
- After providing value through information on the landing page, they recommend explaining that there is more information available and capturing the visitor's contact information through an email sign-up box. 
- Once the contact information is submitted, it should be stored in a database and the visitor should be redirected to a thank you page confirming their report/information will be sent. This helps to build trust and leave the door open for further communication.
- They recommend using pay-per-click advertising, social media, content marketing, and search engine optimization as sources for generating leads. Pay-per-click in particular allows you to pay to rank higher in search engines and gain more visibility.

In summary, their key recommendations are:
1) Create targeted landing pages 
2) Provide value/information to build trust
3) Capture contact information through email sign-ups
4) Follow up and send the promised information 
5) Use pay-per-click, social, content, and SEO for lead generation

Does this help summarize the key highlights from the provided information on their business and recommendations? Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.

 

- Google's pay-per-click advertising service is called AdWords. Advertisers bid for visibility and ranking in Google's search results. 

- The ads at the top of the page, usually the first 2-3 listings, are in the most visible "top zone". Lower ranked ads appear further down the page. Rank depends on the competitiveness of the search term. Highly competitive terms can have over 100 ranked listings.

- Ad position and cost are determined by an auction. Advertisers bid on specific search terms, called key phrases. The highest bidder gets the top rank. Google also considers ad and landing page quality. Higher quality can beat a higher bid.

- Advertisers only pay when someone clicks their ad. Cost per click varies greatly depending on the key phrase, from $0.10 to $50. Advertisers calculate return on investment to determine how much they can bid. 

- Ads should be highly targeted and specific. Broad terms like "dog grooming" will be very expensive. More specific terms like "Schnauzer grooming" or "Yorkie grooming" are better. The Google Keyword Tool helps determine good key phrases.

- Ads should be intriguing to get clicks. Ask a question, express the viewer's pain point, or offer a free report. The ad should simply arouse curiosity, not actually sell the product.

- Landing pages should match the ad and key phrase. If the ad is for heirloom tomato tips, don't send viewers to the home page. Send them to the heirloom tomato content they're expecting. This improves engagement and quality score.

- Assume impatient, distracted viewers. Get to the point quickly. If impatient viewers understand your message, patient ones will too. 

- Use misspellings and slang in key phrases. For example, use "Yorkie grooming" in addition to "Yorkshire Terrier grooming". Misspellings like "cream de menthe" or "crème di ment" can also work well.

- In summary, do research to choose highly targeted key phrases, bid optimally for good ad position, create intriguing ads, and send viewers to well-matched landing pages. With the right strategy, Google Ads can be very effective.

 

- Visitors may spell a keyword in various ways, so don't assume everyone will spell everything correctly. 
- Monitor keywords related to your competition to show your ads to their potential customers. For example, show ads when people search for your competitor's name. 
- Occasionally, you may receive a cease and desist letter for using a celebrity's name. If so, tell Google to stop showing your ad for that keyword.
- Google AdSense pays you to show other companies' ads on your website. However, don't show AdSense ads on your landing pages because it will distract your visitors. 
- Only show content and lead capture forms on your landing pages. Once you have visitors' contact info, you can show AdSense ads on other website pages. 
- Test different pay-per-click services to find which ones work best for your products. Results can vary between services and products.
- Ranking organically in Google's search results is free but you must earn it through high-quality, popular content and lots of relevant links to your site. 
- Google considers hundreds of factors to determine organic rankings, especially links to your site and your page's topic or theme. 
- Use the Google Keyword Tool's "Website Content" feature to see what Google thinks your page's topic is and optimize your content accordingly. 
- Create detailed pages focused on a narrow topic to rank higher than broad, generalized pages.
- Register with Google's Local Business Center to improve your ranking in Google's local map results and get found by potential local customers. Reviews also help.

 

- Google rankings depend on many factors, not just map listings. The website provides more details on improving local search rankings.

- Article marketing is effective for building credibility and ranking in Google. Writing simple, helpful articles on a consistent basis is key. The website offers recommended resources for using articles in search engine optimization.

- Social media should be used strategically. While platforms like Facebook and Twitter can be time-wasters, they may be effective for reaching certain audiences. The key is to monitor the return on investment. It may help to have someone else run your social media. 

- Blogs are a hybrid of social media and articles. Established blogs can rank well in Google and build influence. Commenting on relevant blogs by providing value to readers is an good way to generate interest in your own website or product.

- YouTube is useful for marketing as Google, which owns YouTube, values video content. Uploading relevant video content, even simple demonstrations or presentations, can increase visibility and drive sales. Success stories like Blendtec show the power of creative video marketing. Basic, affordable equipment is sufficient for creating YouTube videos.

- Press releases were once expensive and time-consuming but the Internet has made self-distribution easy and inexpensive. Press releases should be newsworthy to rank well in Google News and other media. They build credibility and rankings. The website offers a recommended resource for optimizing and distributing press releases.

In summary, a multi-pronged content marketing strategy using articles, social media, video, and press releases is an effective approach to improving search rankings, reaching audiences, and driving business growth. With consistency and a strategic approach, these simple techniques can yield significant results over the long run.

 Here's a summary:

Spend less money but way more time learning the craft of writing press releases. You had to study the publications you wanted your press release to appear in. You wrote your press release, faxed it to the editor, put your hands together, and prayed. Then you waited. If you called the editor you ran the risk of appearing pushy or at least a pest. Maybe you got lucky and your press release got published. In that case, it most likely gave you 24 hours of visibility until the following day’s paper got published, or you got perhaps a month of traction if your story got into a magazine.  

The Internet shattered that model. Now you can go online and for somewhere between free and $200 you can send out your release. The online services have helpful guides to writing effective press releases and it’s also easy to see lots of current examples right there on the site. For a few dollars more you can have a professional editor review and tweak your press release.  

In the old model, editors had to pick and choose their press releases for only the most newsworthy items because they had only so much space to work with. The Internet has no space limitations, so as long as your press release meets certain basic requirements for good English and a clear message, it will be posted quickly—typically the next day.More good news: It’s possible for your press release to be picked up by Google and other major search engines in a matter of hours.  

Before you get too excited let me give you a couple of pointers. First, your press release must have a clear, crisp theme. Remember our discussion about how Google determines the theme of web pages and ranks them accordingly? The same is true with press releases.  

If you would like current recommendations for press release services then go to www.sixfiguresecondincome.com and type “press release” into the search box.

eBay 
I suspect if you asked your friends, “What is eBay?′′you would hear, “It’s an auction site.” Though that’s true, eBay is in reality a search engine for people who have their credit cards in their hands and are ready to buy. For instance, a great deal of eBay transactions occur not through auction, but at a fixed price. eBay also allows the sale of info products.  

There’s another entire hidden use for eBay that few people take advantage of—the classified section. You can pay around $10 and have a whole ebay page up for 30 days. The best part is you’re allowed to include a phone number and also capture names of people who are interested in your materials.  

Here’s another powerful technique that few people have a clue about. If you create a Featured Listing in eBay′s auction system, Google will pick up that listing right in the Google main results—the left zone we talked about earlier.  

Again, don’t expect to rank highly for a really general term because the competition is not only fierce, but you’ll only get wishy- washy leads partially interested in your product. Go for highly specific terms and you can own them, one by one.

Inexpensive and Great Offline Strategies for Getting Found

I’m a big fan of all the excellent online strategies we’ve just covered, but I don’t want to fall into the trap I told you about before—the trap of saying that the traditional stuff is dead and only the new techniques work. 

Local Newspapers
These can be solid sources of leads because they’re always looking for content. You won’t be paid anything when you contribute a story and you might not realize much fame other than the most local variety. Stil , you’re likely to find a willing editor and audience for your message.

Free-Standing Inserts
When you get to the point where you have a few hundred dollars this is a splendid way to get your message across in local papers. You’ve no doubt been the recipient of free- standing inserts, or FSIs. They are single sheets of notebook-size paper inserted into the middle of newspapers. 

Commuter Newspapers
If you live in a larger metropolitan area, you’ve seen these newspapers specifically targeted at commuters. What a great captive audience! They’re tired of working and are on a train or bus with not much to do. They’ll spend more time looking at your ad than if they were home.

Local Clubs and Events
If you use the meetup.com service I mentioned earlier, you may find local clubs or events relevant to your product. These outfits often have mailers, bulletin boards, and online or printed newsletters. 

Direct Mail
People call direct mail junk mail, but it’s only junk if the message is general and hyped. Direct mail can be a fabulous lead generator when it’s a simple postcard to a targeted audience with an offer of a free special report.

Warning: Direct Mail DOES Work. Don’t Listen to Naysayers Who Wrote Lousy Ads and Now Blame Direct Mail for the Lack of Response.

 Here's a summary:

The key to turning prospects into buyers is attention and persuasion. Many marketers make mistakes that turn off prospects:

1. They confuse attention with shouting. Using hype, scare tactics or fake urgency are ineffective and transparent methods to get attention that turn people off.

2. They boost their claims out of all proportion. Exaggerating benefits and using extreme language comes across as dishonest and causes people to search for "the catch". Providing a damaging admission, or acknowledging a downside, helps build credibility. 

3. They focus on themselves, not the customer. Prospects are focused on their own lives and problems, not the marketer's life story or accomplishments. An effective message focuses on the benefits and solutions for the customer.

To be persuasive, speak to your target audience's interests, provide realistic and credible information, and focus on meeting the customer's needs. This builds trust and makes people want what you're offering.

 

The author discusses seven common mistakes ineffective marketers make:

1. Focusing on themselves, not the customer. Effective marketers focus on the needs and desires of the customer, not on themselves. 

2. Failing to demonstrate how the product benefits the customer. Marketers should show how the product improves the customer's life.

3. Asking customers to buy too soon. Effective marketers build value and trust before asking for the sale. 

4. Using fake deadlines. Most customers see through this tactic. It is better to be honest about deadlines.

5. Not including a call to action. Without a call to action, the sales message is just an informational letter. Ask the customer to take action.

6. Speaking to audiences, not individuals. It is better to speak to customers one-on-one. This helps them feel engaged and that their situation is unique.

7. Failing to answer the eight money questions. Effective marketers logically answer these key questions in their sales message:

1. Why should I stop and listen to you?
2. Why should I read the whole thing? 
3. What's in it for me?
4. Why should I trust you? 
5. Why should I buy this now?
6. Why should I buy from you?
7. What guarantees do I get?
8. How much does this cost and what do I get for my money?

By avoiding these mistakes and answering the eight money questions, a marketer can stand out from the competition. Customers will find the message believable, honest and appealing.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- Grabbing readers’ attention quickly is key. Open with something specific and useful to draw them in, rather than a pure sales pitch. 

- Show that you understand your readers and their concerns. Refer to their common frustrations, desires, and insider language. This builds trust and connection.

- Focus on the results and benefits, not just features. Explain how your product or solution will help them, not just what it includes. Ask yourself “so what?” to get to the deeper benefits.

- Establish your unique selling proposition (USP). Explain why your solution is uniquely suited to help them, unlike any competitor. This gives people a reason to buy from you over someone else.

- Provide proof to back up your claims. Share concrete numbers, examples, testimonials, reviews, or any evidence that proves your solution delivers results. Without evidence, words don’t mean much. 

- Be specific and share real details. Exact numbers and examples are more believable than vague or round numbers. Share details on the research, work, or experience behind your solution.

- Testimonials from others who have used your product or solution are powerful social proof. We tend to follow the crowd, so showing others' success or satisfaction helps influence buyers.

In summary, the keys to selling without being “salesy” are building trust, showing you truly understand the customer, focusing on real benefits and results, establishing your uniqueness, and providing genuine proof and social proof. With the right approach, you can draw readers in and keep them engaged to ultimately persuade them to buy.

 

The key points from the passage are:

1. Get feedback and testimonials on your info product before launching it. Make sure the feedback is specific about the results and benefits. Quote experts in your field to build credibility.

2. Do not discuss price upfront. First convince the reader of the value and benefits. Only discuss price after they are interested. 

3. Know your market and competitors' prices but do not compete on price. Compete on value and benefits.

4. Refer to the price as an "investment" rather than a "cost". An investment suggests a future return or benefit. 

5. Offer multiple product levels, e.g. a "complete" and "deluxe" version. This gives the customer a choice to make and some will choose the higher-priced option. The deluxe version can include bonuses like transcripts, worksheets, consultation time, extra content, reference guides, etc.

6. Explain the customer's risk in purchasing, e.g. guarantee, refund policy, etc. This reduces the perceived risk of buying. Mention how easy it is to get the product, e.g. website link and phone number.

7. You have now covered the key "Money Questions" that readers will have about any offer. Following these guidelines will help convince readers to make a purchase.

In summary, the key steps to addressing the reader's "Money Questions" are: build credibility and value, only discuss price at the appropriate time, refer to the price as an investment, offer product options, reduce perceived risk, and make it easy to buy. By systematically addressing these areas, you make it more likely readers will make a purchase.

 Here's a summary:

The key point is that forming relationships with customers after a sale is key to a successful business and long-term revenue. Most businesses fail at this by treating customers as one-off transactions rather than nurturing a relationship. 

A good example is buying a car. The author walked into a Honda dealership, paid $40K in cash for a car, and never heard from them again. This is shortsighted since:

1) The author might buy another car in the future 
2) The author has a family who will need cars 
3) The author might refer friends to the dealer

By failing to build a relationship, the dealer lost out on future business and referrals. In contrast, if the dealer had followed up, provided good service, and stayed in touch, the author would likely be a repeat customer and provide word-of-mouth marketing.

The key is that the real opportunity to bond with customers and gain loyalty is *after* the initial sale, not before. Most customers expect little to no follow-up, so doing even basic outreach can make a huge impression. With a solid base of loyal customers, new products become easier to launch and sell.

To build these relationships, the author recommends using email marketing systems that provide both broadcast emails (like a typical email platform) as well as autoresponders (pre-written automated email sequences). By setting up a nurturing autoresponder campaign, you can stay in regular contact with new customers, provide value, build goodwill, and prime them to buy again in the future.

In summary, long-term business success depends on transitioning customers from one-off sales into lasting, loyal relationships. With some simple outreach and autoresponder emails, you can gain an advantage over competitors, reduce the effort needed to make future sales, and establish a battalion of brand advocates. The key is avoiding the typical "wham bam thank you ma'am" approach and instead cultivating real customer bonding.

 

- Broadcast emails can be sent spontaneously to some or all of your list. Autoresponders are pre-programmed to go out at certain times or in response to certain actions. For example, an autoresponder might send a welcome email instantly when someone signs up for a free trial.

- Email is still widely used, with 90% of Internet users sending or reading email. While some email is spam, good marketers focus on building relationships through valuable content. 

- Segment your list to send the right messages to the right groups. For example, send different autoresponder series to prospects vs. customers. Encourage customers to use your product by sending helpful tips and answers to common questions. Create a "mailbag" series answering customer questions, even if you have to make them up at first.

- Become a "welcome guest" in people's inboxes by avoiding hype and sending a mix of commentary, news, and product information. Occasionally send pure content with no sales pitch. This helps avoid seeming like you only want people's money.

- Make communication two-way by occasionally asking open-ended questions. While some won't respond, others will engage, allowing you to build relationships and get product ideas. 

- Never sell your mailing list. It is your most valuable asset and selling it will damage your customer relationships.

In summary, by segmenting your list, providing value, engaging in two-way communication, and protecting your customer relationships, you can build a profitable business through email marketing. But be very careful to avoid seeming salesy or spammy. Focus on becoming a useful and trusted resource for your subscribers.

 

Build your list carefully by cultivating trusting relationships with your customers over time. Do not sell your customer list to others, as that can damage these relationships and lose you control over how customers are treated.

Stay in close contact with your customers using various means:

- Email: Send a mix of helpful content, tips, and promotional offers. Ask for feedback and opinions. 
- Postcards: Send quarterly postcards with helpful tips and your contact information. This can prompt customers to check out your site and make a purchase.
- Newsletters: Send inexpensive tri-fold self-mailers with a mix of useful information and promotional content.
- Phone calls: Occasionally call customers to ask for their opinions and feedback. This shows you value them and can lead to new product ideas or sales.

Use conversion optimization to maximize profits without increasing costs. This involves:

1. Install measuring tools like Google Analytics and Crazy Egg to track customer behavior and see how people interact with your site.

2. Determine why non-buyers don't buy by analyzing their questions and feedback. Then adjust your site to address their concerns and objections.

3. Test everything to see what works for your particular audience. Test prices, headlines, images, guarantees, bonuses, and more. Start by testing the issues non-buyers pointed out.

In summary, stay closely connected with your customers, gain insights into why some don't buy, make changes to improve their experience, and test the effectiveness of those changes. This can significantly boost your profits over time without added costs.

 

- Google Analytics and Google Website Optimizer are free tools that can provide insights into your visitors and help you optimize your site. For example, Google Analytics may show that visitors spent a lot of time on a page about an embroidery attachment. You could test adding an embroidery video to your product and see if it boosts sales. 

- Google Website Optimizer allows you to test different versions of your site, like different headlines. It will show Version A to some visitors and Version B to others, then tell you which version leads to more conversions. You should constantly be testing and optimizing. Small improvements can add up to big differences.

- While this book provides all the knowledge you need to succeed online, you still need to take action - the "I" Factor. Implementation is key. Progress, no matter how small, will get you to your destination. Live events can help provide motivation and accountability. 

- There are many excuses and false barriers to success, but the real barriers come down to lack of action. Have confidence in yourself and start implementing what you've learned.

- Always progressing and improving, even in small ways, is key to success.  Keep your destination in sight and keep taking steps forward.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the given text:

-There are false barriers to online business success like lack of money, time, technology know-how, etc. But there are real dangers like lack of expertise, poor product, ineffective marketing, and failure to build relationships. 

-To build a profitable product, focus on information products, variations of proven themes, or appealing to hobbyists. Avoid reinventing the wheel. Provide useful tools, reports, and resources.

-To create content, capture it through interviews, videos, audios, or writing. Edit and organize it. Then deliver it through webinars, teleseminars, videos, PDFs, newsletters, blog posts, etc. Use continuity and upselling to boost profits.

-To generate leads, use many sources like search engines, social media, YouTube, article marketing, pay-per-click ads, offline events, etc. Target your market, provide useful information, build continuity and relationships. Cost per lead and return on investment matter. 

-To turn prospects into buyers, avoid shouting at them. Be specific in your claims. Focus on their needs and results. Don't ask them to buy too soon. Issue a clear call to action. Don't use fake deadlines. Address individuals. Answer their money questions.

-Build relationships through email autoresponders, broadcasts, consults, live events, memberships, etc. Measure key metrics, determine why non-buyers don't buy and adjust, and test improvements.

-Success requires the “I” factor: ideas, inventions, information, involvement, the Internet, and investments. Constantly solve problems and seize opportunities.
