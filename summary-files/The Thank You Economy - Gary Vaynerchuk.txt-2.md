 

- Social media has enabled connectedness between people in ways not possible before. This has amplified the power of word-of-mouth marketing and given more influence to individual consumers. 

- Previously, companies could largely ignore customer complaints with little consequence. Now, unhappy customers can seriously damage a company's reputation and business using social media. Companies must be responsive to customer feedback.

- Companies need to build authentic relationships with customers at scale. This means committing to company culture change, using social media for real-time feedback, exceeding customer expectations, and focusing on long-term customer loyalty. 

- Key to success is showing customers the company's values and personality, treating each customer as important, and shaping positive word-of-mouth. This is "the Thank You Economy."

- Big companies can develop personal relationships at large scale by being authentic, valuing each customer, and building real connections. While they may lose some customers to competitors, they will gain more in the long run through loyalty and word-of-mouth.

- Providing excellent service and experiences raises customer expectations. What used to be considered great service is now just average. Companies must exceed expectations and treat all customers with respect to compete.

- Some examples of companies succeeding in the Thank You Economy include:

› Wufoo - Sends random handwritten thank you notes to long-time customers. 
› Companies known for superior service - Like luxury brands that provide first-class treatment, raising expectations across industries.
› Avaya, AJ Bombers, Joie de Vivre Hotels, Irena Vaksman (dentist) - Build community and provide great experiences for customers.

- The key themes are: build authentic relationships, commit to culture change, use feedback, exceed expectations, focus on the long-term, show your personality, treat customers as important, spread positive word-of-mouth, and be responsive. Companies that do this will succeed in the Thank You Economy.


 

- Social media engagement and building one-to-one relationships with customers leads to business growth through word-of-mouth promotion. 

- Companies should respond to all online conversations about their brand and participate actively in social media. Ignoring social media means missing opportunities and allowing negative word-of-mouth.

- CEOs and companies need to commit to implementing social media and a "thank you economy" culture focused on customer experience to stay competitive. Though the ROI metrics are still developing, the long-term benefits are clear.

- Showing customers you care by addressing complaints and offering perks builds loyalty and word-of-mouth promotion. Social media allows this type of interaction at scale.

- Social media is transforming business by enabling closer relationships and experiences. Though the tools change, the shift to a focus on customer relationships is here to stay.

- First-mover advantage matters. The sooner brands build social media relationships and trust, the greater their competitive edge will be. These relationships take time and emotional investment to develop.

- You can't buy social media followers or relationships. They must be built through value, engagement, listening, and trust over time. The key is to be authentic and address issues transparently.

- Negative comments can't be controlled but responsiveness can turn critics into fans. The key is to listen and address issues sincerely. Trying to control the message often backfires.

- Social media ROI is real through customer loyalty, word-of-mouth, and increased spending. Studies show the significant value of superior customer service and experience.

The summary highlights why social media and building customer relationships are essential for business today, the key factors that lead to social media success, and evidence that the ROI for authentic engagement is real and substantial. The main takeaway is that brands must embrace new ways of interacting with and serving customers in order to thrive.

 

• Companies should invest in authentic communication with customers and employees on social media. An honest, caring response to issues can turn a crisis into an opportunity. 

• Fear of social media and restricting employee use is counterproductive. With the right culture and hiring, employees will strengthen the brand. However, companies must address unacceptable behavior.

• Overreacting to employee social media use damages culture and hurts public image. Best Buy’s suspension of an employee for an iPhone video was excessive and prevented learning. 

• Be authentic like the umpire who admitted his mistake. Insincerity is detectable and damages relationships. Focus on real connections.

• In the “Thank You Economy,” empower all employees to serve customers. Small acts of appreciation build loyalty. Free product for good service is a calculated risk that can be tested and tracked. 

• The dollar value of good customer service and an engaging company culture is huge. Earned media and word-of-mouth marketing are powerful. 

• Know your employees’ needs and communicate directly. While ambitious staff may leave eventually, a caring culture attracts and retains top talent. 

• Trust employees and give them freedom to be authentic. Monitor social media for insight into job performance and satisfaction. Address issues to build a motivated, loyal team.

• With the right people and culture, businesses can thrive. Invest in open communication and community. Talk to people as humans, not numbers. Reward risk-taking and sharing ideas.

• The CEO who wrote to an unhappy customer built loyalty through sincerity. His tone resonated and spread the company’s story. Business leaders should do the same to succeed today.

 

The key lessons are:

1. Engage emotionally and personally with customers to build goodwill and loyalty. This could include responding to all comments, joining conversations, solving problems, and thanking customers. 

2. Implement “big things” like major initiatives to positively impact customers in memorable ways. Big things don’t require huge budgets. Examples include providing amazing service, solving frustrations, creating shareable experiences, strategic partnerships, taking a stand on social issues, or running exciting contests. 

3. 50 Cent turned criticism into an opportunity to connect by flying in a teen YouTube fan who had criticized him. Celebrities and companies alike can benefit from randomly engaging with and surprising loyal customers. Though expensive, it generates buzz, media, and loyalty.

4. “Shock and awe” campaigns that provide over-the-top experiences generate attention and media coverage. As technology changes, companies must adapt shock and awe to stay effective. 

5. Avaya, a B2B tech company, uses social media to engage customers by meeting them where they are and providing value. They leverage Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and an online community to connect with different audiences. They host live chats, partner with customers on content, and sponsor social media events to educate and build relationships. 

6. Social media allowed Avaya to showcase culture and connect personally, changing perceptions of a B2B company. The key is genuinely engaging with and providing value to customers to build goodwill, trust and loyalty over the long run.

In summary, the key lessons around using social media to build brand loyalty are:

Focus on emotionally engaging with customers by providing real value and meaningful interactions.  Use both “little things” like consistent responsiveness as well as “big things” like major campaigns to create connections and excitement. Authenticity, good intent and caring about customer experiences are musts. Though expensive, shock and awe and random acts of kindness generate media and word-of-mouth. The ultimate goals are building relationships, trust and goodwill to foster brand advocates and loyalty.

1. Leadership commitment

• AJ Bombers, a restaurant, built success through open communication, community, and rewarding loyal customers. They livestreamed fixing a broken grill, held events, and made the Foursquare “mayor” a free burger. Though giving away much, they gained dedicated customers who frequent and recommend them.

- Businesses must stay on top of trends to succeed. They need to build emotional connections, understand customer networks, and focus on lifetime customer value. Investing in customers will yield the best results.

- Many big companies don't innovate due to fear of failure or short-term thinking. Smaller companies are often more passionate and willing to take risks. Some want to limit social media use to protect their business, but social media metrics can be useful.

- Marketing strategies should match the environment. Old strategies used overwhelming force; new strategies build trust and target specific groups. Big, broad approaches don't work for local or niche marketing. Brands must adapt.

- Brands need to overcome distrust in new metrics and fear of change. Start conversations, build trust, target local/niche audiences, and innovate. Big, broad marketing is outdated. Adaptive brands will succeed.
