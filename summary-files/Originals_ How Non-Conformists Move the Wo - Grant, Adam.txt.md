 

- In 2008, four students wanted to make eyewear more affordable and set out to revolutionize the industry. They faced criticism that their idea was implausible. 
- The eyewear industry was dominated by Luxottica, which controlled over 80% of the market. The students wanted to create an alternative.
- They started a company called Warby Parker to sell glasses online for $95, compared to $500 in stores. For each pair sold, they would donate a pair to someone in need. 
- They launched a website the night before officially starting the company. They expected to sell a few pairs per day but ended up selling out their inventory for the first year in less than a month. 
- They were named the most innovative company by Fast Company in 2015, ahead of much larger companies like Google, Nike, and Apple. They have since become a leader in affordable eyewear.

The key message is that going against the grain and conventional wisdom can lead to creative ideas that disrupt industries. The students faced doubts and criticism but persisted to build a successful business through their vision. With determination and resilience, rebellious ideas can achieve impact.

 

- Tartup was a new startup founded in 2009 that grew very quickly. In 5 years, it had 500 employees, $100 million in revenue, and a $1 billion valuation. 
- The author was offered a chance to invest in Tartup early on but declined. He now considers this one of his worst financial decisions and is trying to understand why he made the wrong choice.
- Psychologists define two routes to achievement: conformity (following the crowd) and originality (taking the unconventional path that improves things). True originality combines creativity (generating a novel and useful idea) and initiative (taking action to make the idea happen). 
- Tartup’s founders had the originality to envision selling glasses online in a new way and the initiative to make it happen. The author aims to show how we can all become more original.
- A study of customer service agents found that those who use Firefox or Chrome stay in their jobs 15-19% longer, have higher sales, shorter call times, and more satisfied customers. This is because choosing those browsers signals a tendency to show initiative, not accept defaults, and seek better options. 
- Most people accept default conditions without questioning them. Studies show disadvantaged groups often support the status quo more than advantaged ones. This “system justification” serves to emotionally soothe people about undesirable conditions. But it prevents moral outrage at injustice and creative thinking about alternatives.
- Rejecting defaults and considering better options is the hallmark of originality. It starts with “vuja de” — seeing the familiar with a fresh perspective. Without this, Warby Parker’s founders wouldn’t have realized glasses were unreasonably expensive and envisioned a new way of selling them.

 

- The passage discusses the two faces of ambition - the drive to achieve and the drive to be original. While ambition fuels accomplishments, it can also inhibit creativity and original thinking.

- Child prodigies tend to lack originality, even as they achieve mastery in various fields. They are excellent at following the rules and meeting expectations, but rarely forge new paths. They aim to gain approval and admiration rather than challenge the status quo. 

- Many historical change makers and creators were reluctant to pursue original ideas or take stands. They had to be convinced or pressured by others. For example, John Adams and George Washington were hesitant to join the American Revolution; Martin Luther King Jr. was apprehensive about leading the civil rights movement; and Michelangelo was reluctant to take on the Sistine Chapel fresco.

- When the drive to achieve is too strong, it can crowd out creativity. The intense desire for success leads people to choose "guaranteed success" over original accomplishment. They become afraid to fail or take risks.

- Although ambition drives progress, it takes courage and originality to remake the world. Systems and defaults are made by people, so they can be changed. But this requires the ability to question the status quo and envision alternative possibilities.

In summary, the passage highlights the tensions between ambition, achievement, and originality. While ambition is necessary for progress, an imbalance toward achievement over originality stifles creativity and meaningful change. The most influential people are often those who overcome their fear of failure and push for new ideas, not just excellence in existing domains. Originality requires the courage to question defaults and reimagine new possibilities.

 

- Angelo was reluctant to take on the painting project for the Sistine Chapel. He saw himself as a sculptor, not a painter, and found the task overwhelming. It took two years and pressure from the pope for him to start work. 

- Nicolaus Copernicus delayed publishing his theory that the earth revolves around the sun for decades due to fear of rejection and ridicule. He only published after a cardinal wrote encouraging him to do so and a mathematics professor submitted his work for publication without his consent.

- Steve Wozniak was hesitant to leave his job at Hewlett-Packard to co-found Apple with Steve Jobs, even after receiving $250,000 in funding. He was afraid to start a company and needed encouragement from Jobs and others to change his mind.

- Many people never pursue, publicize or promote their original ideas due to fear of failure or a desire to conform. Studies show many people stay silent about concerns at work or in society to avoid standing out.

- The founders of Warby Parker provide an example. Despite being passionate about their idea, they remained in school, interned, and lined up jobs as a safety net in case the company failed. The author doubted their conviction and expected them to fail but came to see their hedging as the reason for their success. 

- Originality is often erroneously associated with extreme risk-taking. In reality, even pioneers experience fear, self-doubt and a preference for avoiding risk. They are often driven to action by others rather than being self-starters. The myth of the risk-taking entrepreneur is debunked.

- A study found that entrepreneurs who kept their day jobs while launching their companies were more risk-averse but ultimately more successful than those who quit to focus full-time on their startups. Their risk aversion, not risk-taking, contributed to their success.

In summary, the key message is that originality and risk-taking are not synonymous. Even pioneers who bring new ideas into the world grapple with fear and self-doubt and often prefer to avoid risk when possible. Their success stems from their ability to overcome these obstacles, not an inherent boldness or immunity to risk. Challenging the notion of the self-assured risk-taking pioneer, the author argues true originality requires acknowledging these fears and moving forward despite them.

 

- According to the research, entrepreneurs who keep their day jobs have a significantly lower chance of failure compared to those who quit. Risk-averse entrepreneurs and those with self-doubts tend to build more sustainable businesses.

- The article cites many successful entrepreneurs and creatives who kept their day jobs for years after starting their companies or creating their works of art. This includes the founders of companies like Google, Apple, and Warby Parker. Keeping a steady job provides stability and security, allowing people to take bigger risks in their side projects. 

- This balancing of risks in different areas of life is known as creating a “risk portfolio.” Taking extreme risks in one domain can be offset by being extremely cautious in another. This allows creativity and originality to flourish in some areas.

- The most successful entrepreneurs are not big risk-takers. They take the risk out of risk-taking by mitigating risk wherever possible. Bill Gates, for example, took a leave of absence from Harvard instead of dropping out, and had his parents' financial support. Warby Parker's founders spent months planning and took an entrepreneurship class to minimize uncertainty. 	

- Evidence shows that most entrepreneurs do not have a higher tolerance for risk than average. They work to minimize risk in their ventures. Keeping a steady job is one way to offset the risk of starting a new business.

- In summary, the research and examples show that risk aversion and self-doubt do not preclude entrepreneurial success or creativity. Reducing risk wherever possible, such as by maintaining a day job, allows people the security to take bigger risks in starting a business or creating something new. A balanced “risk portfolio” is key.

 

- Successful entrepreneurs and original thinkers are not big risk takers. They carefully calculate risks and take calculated risks, not dangerous ones. Studies show that successful entrepreneurs engaged in some rule-breaking behavior as teens but avoided seriously risky behavior.  

- Successful entrepreneurs and originals are not non-conformists who don’t care about social approval. Studies show concern for social approval is unrelated to becoming an entrepreneur or a successful leader. Even great leaders like Abraham Lincoln cared deeply about public approval.

- Originality is a choice, not a fixed trait. People can become more original by questioning defaults and seeing their roles and skills as flexible and changeable. An experiment at Google found that employees were happier and more productive when they were prompted to see their jobs as malleable. 

- The book will provide strategies for championing new ideas, including how to recognize promising new ideas, how to communicate new ideas effectively with the right audiences and messages, how to build coalitions of support, and how to determine the right time to act on new ideas.

- The book will share stories of original thinkers and leaders in business, politics, sports, and entertainment to illustrate these strategies, including how the show Survivor made it on air, an entrepreneur’s unusual pitching strategy, a CIA analyst who changed intelligence practices, and a woman at Apple who challenged Steve Jobs.

- Key strategies include: delaying action to choose the right time, turning enemies into allies, balancing idealism and pragmatism, blending the familiar with the new, and more. Success is about execution of new ideas, not just generating them.

The overarching message is that originality is a deliberate choice that involves managing risk, gaining buy-in, and timing action well - not an innate personality trait or a function of big risk-taking. With the right strategies and mindsets, people can develop and spread new ideas, and leaders can build cultures where originality thrives.

 

- The invention of the Segway personal transporter and the TV show Seinfeld were initially expected to succeed but ultimately failed or almost failed. Their stories show how difficult it is to evaluate new ideas and determine which ones will be hits. 

- The challenge is not coming up with new ideas but choosing the right ones. Studies show most new ideas are unique, but we struggle to identify those with potential. This is known as the problem of "false positives" (ideas expected to succeed that fail) and "false negatives" (ideas expected to fail that succeed).

- The inventor of the Segway, Dean Kamen, is a genius inventor known for breakthroughs like portable dialysis machines and a wheelchair that climbs stairs. But even innovative creators can struggle to objectively evaluate their own ideas. Research shows circus performers and creators are poor judges of how audiences will respond to their work. 

- Two venture capitalists anticipated the Segway would flop because they focused on market factors rather than the technology alone. The NBC executive who saved Seinfeld looked beyond poor audience test results to see its potential based on the creators' comedic talents. Their ability to avoid false positives and false negatives came down to embracing uncertainty, relying on observations beyond the idea itself, and balancing passion with skepticism.

- False positives like the Segway happen when we get swept away by hype, judged novelty over impact, or failed to consider barriers like cost, need, and human psychology. False negatives like Seinfeld are more common in new domains and emerge from flawed evaluation methods, unwillingness to take risks on outliers, and hiring or promoting based on "fit" over ability.

- The path forward lies in assembling diverse, dissenting groups to evaluate ideas; not relying on scores, scores, or averages; probing the reasons behind extreme opinions; and remembering even experts have blind spots. The goal is making better-informed bets, not perfect predictions. Uncertainty is inevitable, but by learning from past errors, we can spot the difference between visionaries and snake oil salesmen.

 

- A study funded crowd-sourced feedback on circus performances. Performers were overconfident and rated their acts about two ranks higher than audiences did. Social scientists have found creators are often overly optimistic about their work. 

- Overconfidence is hard to overcome in creative work. When you have a new idea, it seems unique. Even when past ideas failed, this one is different. Creators are too close to their work and far from the audience to judge well. They have to be overconfident to pursue ideas, but confirmation bias makes them focus on strengths and ignore weaknesses.

- Even geniuses struggle to know when they've created a hit. Beethoven and Picasso created many works and had to experiment, backing up from dead ends. If they knew in the moment they were making a masterpiece, their work would progress straightforwardly. 

- To maximize the odds of a masterpiece, generate many ideas. On average, creative geniuses simply produced more, giving more chances for originality. Shakespeare wrote 37 plays and 154 sonnets in 20 years. Mozart composed over 600 pieces, Beethoven 650, Bach over 1,000. Prolific composers were more likely to have hits. 

- Picasso produced over 4,800 works, a small fraction acclaimed. Angelou wrote 165 poems, Einstein 248 papers. Ira Glass says to do a huge volume of work to be original.

- Prolific people tend to produce their most original work during their most prolific periods. Between 30 and 35, Edison filed over 100 patents, including major inventions and minor ones. Periods with many minor works often also yield major ones. 

- There is no trade-off between quantity and quality in idea generation. Quantity boosts quality. Original thinkers generate many strange, dead-end ideas to get more and novel ones. At Upworthy, 25 headlines were needed for one 59 times more effective. Early ideas tend to be conventional. Desperation and ruling out obvious choices allow considering remote possibilities.

 

- Dean Kamen, the inventor of the Segway, was aware that coming up with successful new ideas requires trying out many possibilities, or “kissing a lot of frogs.” But in developing the Segway, Kamen didn't seek enough feedback and input from potential customers. He was too convinced of his idea and maintained strict secrecy.

- Executives and test audiences often struggle to recognize the potential in highly original ideas. They tend to reject novelty and compare new ideas to familiar prototypes. As people gain expertise, they become more set in their ways of thinking. 

- While creators themselves are prone to being overconfident in their ideas, peer creators can offer the most accurate evaluations. They are open to unusual possibilities but also able to give honest feedback. Performers especially value the opinions of their peers.

- To improve our ability to judge new ideas, we should emulate the open and exploratory mindset of creators. We need to avoid immediately rejecting unfamiliar ideas and instead consider their potential. Getting input from peer creators is more valuable than feedback from managers or test audiences.

- The examples of Seinfeld, the Segway, and various other creative works show how easily highly original ideas can be dismissed. But with the open and exploratory approach of creators, as well as feedback from peers, we can improve our ability to recognize innovative new ideas.

 

- Berg conducted experiments showing that people who spent time generating their own ideas were better able to identify promising new ideas proposed by others. This was because generating ideas put them in a creative mindset that made them more open to novelty. In contrast, people who adopted an evaluative mindset by listing criteria for judging ideas were prone to dismissing unconventional ideas, a tendency known as “false negatives.”

- The difficulties of getting Seinfeld on the air illustrate these dynamics. Viewers and TV executives panned the unconventional show in research and focus groups. But Rick Ludwin, who worked outside the sitcom department, was able to see its potential. His experience in comedy gave him expertise, but his broader experience prevented him from narrowly evaluating the show based on the standard sitcom format. 

- Research shows that eminent scientists, inventors, and entrepreneurs often have artistic hobbies and interests that provide creative insight. For example, Galileo’s training in chiaroscuro, an artistic technique focusing on light and shade, helped him recognize mountains on the moon. Creative people also tend to travel more, gaining exposure to diverse cultures and new ways of thinking.

- A study found that fashion designers who had more international experience produced more creative collections, as rated by fashion buyers and critics. Travel and exposure to different cultures seems to spur creativity.

In summary, the research and examples show that creativity benefits from a combination of expertise and breadth. Expertise provides depth of knowledge in a domain, but needs to be balanced with a breadth of experiences and openness to new ways of thinking. Generating ideas, engaging with the arts, and exposure to diverse cultures are ways to cultivate the breadth that fosters creativity.

 

- The directors of the most original fashion collections were those who had spent the most time working abroad, especially in cultures very different from their own. Depth of experience mattered more than number of countries. 
- The key factors were:

1. Time spent actively working abroad, not just living abroad. Engagement in design work in other countries led to hits.  
2. Exposure to cultures highly divergent from their native culture. Experience in very different countries spurred more creativity. 
3. Depth of experience: Longer time working abroad, ideally over 35 years, enabled internalizing new ideas and combining them with old ones.

- Rick Ludwin oversaw Seinfeld for NBC. His experience working many years in different TV genres (variety, daytime, late night) gave him the insight to see Seinfeld's potential and bet on its unorthodox writers.

- Steve Jobs invested in the Segway based largely on intuition and enthusiasm, not systematic analysis. This led him to overestimate its potential.

- Three factors contributed to Jobs' overconfidence:

1. Lack of experience in the transportation domain. Intuition is most accurate in areas where we have deep experience. Without it, analysis is better.

2. Hubris from past success in other areas. Success can breed overconfidence in new domains. 

3. Enthusiasm for the Segway's novelty and "Wow factor." Jobs valued novelty but underestimated the importance of practicality and usefulness.

- For intuitions to be trusted, we need stable environments and predictable relationships between past experience and new situations. Unpredictable, fast-changing domains like transportation, politics, and stock markets limit the value of intuition. Analysis becomes more critical.

- Some early skeptics questioned the Segway's practicality, usefulness, and potential for changing behavior given its high cost. They saw more potential in niche applications like mail delivery, golfing, and theme parks. But their doubts were overruled.

In summary, intuition led Steve Jobs astray on the Segway because he lacked experience in transportation, was hubristic from past success in other areas, and overly valued the device's novelty. Systematic analysis of its practical usefulness was needed but limited by overconfidence in intuition.

 

- Jobs's intuitive thinking style and lack of experience in transportation made him susceptible to being overly swayed by Dean Kamen's passion and enthusiasm when presenting the Segway. 

- Research shows that intuitive thinkers and investors are more prone to being persuaded by an entrepreneur's passion during a pitch. Analytical thinkers focus more on facts.

- Passion is important for entrepreneurial success, but it needs to be passion for executing an idea, not just passion for the idea itself. Kamen lacked experience in building a company and bringing a product to market.

- To assess if an idea will be successful, look beyond the enthusiasm of the entrepreneurs and examine their track record of execution. Kamen had a history of inventing in response to customers, not finding problems himself. 

- The author failed to invest in Warby Parker because he lacked the necessary breadth of experience. The founders had diverse experience, tested their ideas extensively, and brought strong passion for execution.  

- Warby Parker's success stems from involving peers in evaluating ideas. Their program inviting employee suggestions led to a fourfold increase in idea submissions and improvements like overhauling their retail process.

In summary, the key takeaways are: evaluate passion for execution, not just for ideas; look beyond enthusiasm to track records and experience; involve those with relevant breadth and depth of knowledge; and test ideas and get feedback before charging ahead. The author argues that these principles could have helped avoid mistakes like investing in the Segway and missing out on opportunities like Warby Parker.

 Here is a summary of the passage:

- Carmen Medina was a CIA analyst who recognized the need for intelligence agencies to share information in real time over the internet. She advocated for a platform like Intellipedia, where analysts could update findings continuously. 

- Her initial suggestions were shot down by colleagues who thought the internet threatened security and preferred the existing system of printed intelligence reports. Medina continued speaking up but faced backlash and stalled career opportunities.

- A decade later, Medina helped create Intellipedia in her role as deputy director of intelligence at the CIA. Intellipedia enabled intelligence sharing and coordination, winning a major award. Medina's perseverance and learning how to communicate her ideas more effectively eventually paid off.

- The passage examines when and how to voice minority opinions or advocate for change without damaging your career. Key lessons include:

1) Choose the right time - Speaking up is more likely to be effective when the world has changed in a way that makes your ideas more relevant or necessary. For Medina, the spread of the internet and 9/11 created openings for her proposals.

2) Gain credibility and authority - Medina's promotion to deputy director gave her the power to back Intellipedia. To be heard, you often need a platform and track record that establishes your expertise. 

3) Learn better communication strategies - Medina adjusted how she voiced her opinions to eventually win people over. There are ways to speak up that reduce risks and increase your persuasiveness.

4) Be willing to fail and persevere - Medina faced rejection and career setbacks for her initial advocacy but continued championing her vision until the time was right. Speaking truth to power requires persistence in the face of opposition.

The key message is that while dissent and novel ideas often meet resistance, with the right approach you can find ways to express them that expand your influence rather than diminish it. The passage profiles strategies and attributes that enable people to positively shape the organizations and communities they are a part of.

 

- Leaders and managers appreciate employees who take initiative to help, build networks, gather knowledge, and seek feedback. However, they tend to penalize employees who speak up with suggestions and new ideas. Studies show that employees who frequently voice ideas and concerns are less likely to get raises and promotions. Those who speak up against racism and injustice also often face criticism. It can be lonely to stand up for what is right.

- To understand why Carmen Medina faced barriers, we must distinguish between power and status. Power is the ability to exert control or influence over others. Status is being respected and admired. People without status who try to exert power are seen as coercive and self-serving. Medina lacked status after being overseas for years, so her colleagues dismissed her ideas. This fueled a vicious cycle of resentment and disrespect. 

- Medina aimed to gain status to change the system from within. She took a conservative job focusing on information security to build credibility. She used this role to gradually introduce the idea of digital publishing. By advancing the CIA’s mission, she earned “idiosyncrasy credits” - the latitude to deviate from expectations. High-status people can get away with bucking conventions in ways that low-status people cannot.

- With power and status, Medina gained more freedom in how she expressed her ideas. To gain initial status, though, she had to be strategic in how she spoke up. Her approach resembles a counterintuitive startup pitch known as the “Sarick Effect.”

- The Sarick Effect involves leading with weaknesses and flaws instead of strengths. This disarms skeptical audiences, shows humility, and prompts the audience to contribute ideas. It also makes the ultimate proposal seem reasonable by comparison. Rufus Griscom used this approach to secure funding and sell his company Babble, admitting flaws that normally would have killed the pitch. 

- In summary, to influence powerful audiences, people without status must be strategic in how they communicate to gain credibility and support. The Sarick Effect, emphasizing weaknesses, can be an effective way to persuade skeptical audiences and prompt collaboration. With status and power, people gain more freedom to share ideas directly. But status must be earned; it cannot be claimed.

 

- Rufus Griscom initially emphasized only the upsides of his ideas and company when pitching to investors and board members. But this came across as overly optimistic salesmanship and was met with skepticism. 

- He then changed his approach and began openly discussing the problems and weaknesses of his company. This led to a much more favorable reaction. Audiences let their guard down, shifted to a problem-solving mindset, and viewed him as more trustworthy. 

- Discussing the limitations of an idea makes you seem smarter and more perceptive. An experiment found that reviewers who gave negative critiques were viewed as 14-16% more intelligent than those giving positive reviews.

- Acknowledging weaknesses also establishes trust and credibility. If you're willing to be upfront about what's wrong, audiences will think there must be a lot that's right. This allowed Griscom to build trust and ultimately get acquired.

- Discussing problems first also leaves audiences with a more favorable view of the idea itself due to a psychological bias. It's harder for people to generate their own concerns after you've already mentioned the major ones. So they conclude the problems aren't actually that bad. 

- The tapping exercise shows how we underestimate the difficulty of understanding something that's familiar to us but unfamiliar to others. We assume others will grasp it easily when in reality they likely won't. 

- To speak up effectively, make the positive and familiar features of your ideas easy to process for your audience. Help them understand what's familiar and important to you.

 Here is a summary of the passage:

- People are overconfident in their ability to communicate new ideas to others. The author illustrates this with an experiment where people tried to tap out the rhythm of songs to others, but only 2.5% guessed the song correctly. We have a hard time imagining what an idea sounds like to someone hearing it for the first time. 

- This is why we often undercommunicate new ideas. The author cites research showing change agents communicate visions about 10 times less than needed. New ideas require effort to understand, so repetition and exposure are key.

- The “mere exposure effect” shows we like things more the more we encounter them. This is why the author used the made-up terms “Sarick effect” and “Leslie Sarick” multiple times. Familiarity breeds comfort, not contempt. However, too much exposure can lead to boredom. Evidence suggests 10-20 exposures are good for new ideas.

- Carmen Medina used this approach to get the CIA to be more open to sharing information. She started a blog and posted about the need for less secrecy and more sharing twice a week. At first, leaders dismissed it but warmed up over time. The repetition and delays helped the idea sink in. 

- According to research, when unsatisfied with a situation, we have four options: exit, voice, persistence, neglect. Exit means leaving. Voice means speaking up to improve it. Persistence means dealing with it. Neglect means reducing effort. Our choice depends on our feelings of control and commitment.

- Medina felt like she was between neglect and loyalty after being silenced. She spoke up again because she had a boss she cared about, even though he was cynical and critical. Disagreeable bosses can sometimes advocate for us better than agreeable ones, who avoid conflict. 

- In summary, the key reasons Medina kept speaking up were: she was committed to her work, she believed her new boss would support her, repetition and familiarity helped get leadership on board, and disagreeable managers can make good advocates. Perseverance and the right allies enabled her to find her voice again.

 Here’s a summary:

- Management researchers Jeff LePine and Linn Van Dyne found that disagreeable people who are willing to go against social conventions are often more comfortable speaking up. While they may lack social skills, they are good at challenging the status quo. 

- A study found that agreeable people were happiest when complimenting others or pleasing them. Disagreeable people were happiest when criticizing or confronting others.

- When speaking up, the audience matters as much as the message. Agreeable audiences often avoid giving critical feedback. Disagreeable managers are more willing to challenge ideas, helping others strengthen their ability to speak up.

- As Carmen Medina rose in the CIA, her colleagues became more open to her ideas. Middle managers were most dismissive. Social science shows that people in the middle of status hierarchies conform the most to avoid losing status. Those at the top and bottom have more freedom to deviate.

- Speaking up as a woman is hard, as people expect women to be communal, not assertive leaders. Studies show women face penalties for speaking up that men do not. Medina faced this her first time speaking up but avoided it the second time by focusing on the mission, not herself.

- As a Puerto Rican woman, Medina faced double jeopardy. Research shows double minorities face harsher penalties for failure but also more flexibility to act assertively without stereotype violation, if clearly competent. They must prove their competence to get heard.  

- In summary, dissenting voices that challenge groupthink are critical for organizations. But for women, minorities, and double minorities, speaking up requires navigating stereotypes and unfair double standards. With perseverance and a focus on competence and mission, these voices can change workplaces for the better.

 

- It is important to earn status and build credibility before exercising power. Carmen Medina built successes quietly without attracting attention, allowing her to “fly under the radar.” Once she had enough wins, she spoke up and people listened. 

- Donna Dubinsky objected to Steve Jobs’ plan to move to just-in-time production, thinking it would jeopardize Apple’s success. Although she was in the minority, she earned the right to speak up by being a high performer known for delivering results. She gave an ultimatum that she would leave if not given 30 days to develop an alternative proposal. Her proposal was accepted.

- Exit and voice are ways to handle dissatisfaction and enact change. Exit is easier now thanks to globalization and technology, but it enables the status quo to endure. Voice feeds on lack of opportunity for exit. Exit can be a path to originality, as with Dubinsky leaving Apple and Palm to found Handspring. The key is voicing opinions and preparing to exit if necessary. 

- We regret inaction more than action. Although Medina chose voice and Dubinsky chose exit, both spoke up rather than staying silent. Few people wish they had censored themselves more.

- Timing and strategic delay can be advantageous. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech despite struggling to prepare it until the early morning hours before the March on Washington. The speech became iconic, showing how waiting for the right time and place to act can be useful. Rushing in too soon risks the “first-mover disadvantage.” It is better to be a “fast follower” by learning from pioneers' mistakes.

 

- Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech at the March on Washington in 1963. Despite the importance and scale of the event, King did not start writing his speech until the night before. 

- King's delay in preparing the speech turned out to be fortunate. His procrastination allowed him to engage in divergent thinking and consider a wider range of ideas, ultimately choosing a direction that was highly impactful and inspiring.

- Procrastination is usually seen as harmful, but it can be useful for creativity. Delaying progress on a task gives you more time to explore different options instead of settling on the first idea that comes to mind. Studies show that procrastination can lead to more novel and original ideas and solutions.

- Great creative thinkers like Leonardo da Vinci were often procrastinators. Da Vinci's procrastination allowed him to make new connections across areas that fueled his original thinking. Although sometimes frustrating, da Vinci realized that genius "sometimes accomplish[es] most when they work the least."

- A study of winners of the Science Talent Search, a prestigious science competition for high school students, found that over two-thirds admitted to procrastinating in at least two areas of their lives, including on creative tasks. For creative thinking, procrastination seems to provide the "incubation time" required to see new connections and perspectives.

- In sum, while procrastination is usually seen as a vice, it also has virtues. When harnessed strategically, procrastination can lead to more divergent thinking, creativity, and originality. The key is using the delay in progress to allow your mind to incubate new ideas, not just waste time. With practice and the right mindset, procrastination can become a useful tool for original thinking.

 

- Procrastination proved useful for creative work. Scientists and leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. delayed work on important tasks to allow ideas to incubate and mature.  King and his team procrastinated in preparing his famous "I Have a Dream" speech, which allowed them to draw on a wider range of ideas and input and left King open to improvising powerful sections of the speech, like the dream metaphor.

- Procrastination has two key benefits for creativity:

1. It allows novel ideas to emerge. By avoiding premature closure on a solution, the mind continues to work on the problem in the background, allowing new connections and insights to form. 

2. It enables flexibility and improvisation. When we plan too far in advance, we tend to stick rigidly to our plans. Procrastination leaves us open to adapting to new opportunities and ideas that emerge spontaneously.

- Although King procrastinated in preparing the speech, he was not unprepared. He had a wealth of material to draw on from previous speeches and experience, and he continued revising the speech up until he began speaking. His procrastination was strategic.

- Timing plays a huge role in success and failure. The timing of King's speech, and his ability to improvise to take advantage of the mood and events of the moment, was crucial to its memorable impact and power. In business, timing accounts for nearly half the difference between success and failure of new companies and products. Successful leaders and "pioneers" have a keen sense of timing and adapting to events, while "settlers" who plan meticulously often miss opportunities by being too rigid.

The key lessons are:  procrastinate strategically, not carelessly; stay open to improvisation and adapting to new opportunities; and develop a sense of timing to take advantage of critical moments. Planning and preparation are still important, but avoid premature closure. Look for the right moment, and be ready to adapt.

 

• There is little evidence to support the notion of a first-mover advantage. Studies show pioneers often have lower survival rates and profits than settlers who enter markets later. 

• There are four major disadvantages of being a pioneer:

1. Pioneers often overstep by scaling up too quickly before the market is ready, leading to premature failure. Kozmo is an example of a startup that failed by promising one-hour delivery before the infrastructure was in place to support it.

2. Pioneers tend to be more risk-seeking, making them prone to impulsive decisions. Settlers are often more cautious and deliberate, leading to higher success rates. 

3. Settlers can learn from the mistakes of pioneers and improve upon their technology and offerings. They have the benefit of hindsight.

4. Pioneers get stuck in routines that don't meet changing market needs. Settlers can observe shifts in the market and consumer tastes and adapt accordingly. Studies show pioneers in the auto industry had lower survival rates because they struggled to adjust.

• Timing is critical. Many original ideas, people, and movements have failed because they were ahead of their time. Carmen Medina's idea to increase information sharing at the CIA and Ignaz Semmelweis's discovery of hand washing were initially rejected but later accepted as times changed.

• There are some exceptions where first-mover advantages do apply, such as when technology can be patented or when strong network effects are present. But in most cases, being first does not equate to higher odds of success. Rushing to beat competitors can be a mistake. Waiting and learning from the experiences of pioneers often leads to better outcomes.

In summary, the evidence does not support a general first-mover advantage. Being original is usually better than being first. Success is more likely to come from observing, learning, and adapting to the market rather than rushing into it.

 

While many believe that originality declines with age as people become set in their ways, this is not always the case. There are two styles of creativity - conceptual and experimental. Conceptual innovators generate ideas early but struggle to remain original over time. Experimental innovators take longer to achieve originality but are able to sustain it. 

Conceptual innovators come up with radical new ideas and execute them quickly. They peak early, as it is easiest to have striking insights with a fresh perspective. However, their originality declines over time as they become entrenched in fixed patterns of thinking. Examples include Einstein, Cummings, and da Vinci.

In contrast, experimental innovators solve problems through trial-and-error experimentation. They peak later, as it takes time to accumulate knowledge and skills. But their originality proves more renewable, as experiments enable new discoveries. Examples include Sperry, Frost, Twain, King, Wright, and Hitchcock. 

To sustain originality over a lifetime, it is best to take an experimental approach. Make fewer plans, test out tentative ideas, and discover unexpected ends. This balances the risks of declining adaptability that come with age and expertise. With an experimental mindset, it is never too late to achieve and maintain originality.

In summary, the key to lifelong creativity is adaptability, reducing the risks associated with originality that comes from fixed ways of thinking. An experimental approach supports continued adaptability and the discovery of new ideas, even for those with decades of experience.

 

- Raymond Davis shared the Nobel Prize in physics at age 80 after starting research at 51. The more you experiment, the less constrained you are by past ideas. Learning from experiences improves creativity. Slow experimentation can lead to originality, not just bolts of insight. 

- Lucy Stone was a pioneering activist for women's rights in 19th-century America. In 1851 she gave a speech that ignited the movement. She worked with Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton for 15 years before their coalition collapsed due to differences.

- Coalitions are powerful but unstable, relying on relationships between members. They require balancing pragmatism and ideals. Anthony and Stanton split from the more mainstream Stone due to "horizontal hostility," where radical groups disparage more moderate allies.  

- Freud called minor differences between similar people the basis for "strangeness and hostility." A study found vegans showed more prejudice toward vegetarians than vice versa. Extreme groups seek to differentiate themselves from moderates who threaten their values.

- Anthony and Stanton partnered with a racist, angering Stone. Their split damaged the movement, showing the need to temper radicalism to build coalitions. Western states granted suffrage sooner, having more pragmatic alliances. It's better to ally with enemies than "frenemies" who share some but not all values.

- To form alliances, cool the cause enough for others to join. But to draw allies in, the message must be "just right," neither too radical nor too tame. The originals behind a movement will usually be the most extreme, and their ideas may prove too radical for wider alliances.

 

- Lucy Stone and Susan B. Anthony led rival suffrage organizations with different methods and allies. Stone worked at the state level, involved men, and used lobbying and public speaking. Anthony favored confrontational tactics and a federal amendment with women only. 

- Their differing approaches prevented them from working together for over 20 years. Stone saw that common goals weren’t enough; groups also needed shared tactics. Anthony agreed that methods were the “essential issue” dividing them.

- Eventually, suffragists found an ally in the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), a huge conservative group. Though their causes differed, they shared moderate tactics like lobbying, public events, and publishing. Working together, they won women voting rights in several states.

- Meredith Perry founded uBeam to develop wireless power technology, but scientists said it was impossible and investors wanted proof it could work. She couldn’t get support until she stopped explaining the idea and just asked engineers to build components to certain specs. By concealing the purpose, she overcame skepticism and raised $10 million.

- The cases show that allies don’t just share values but also methods. Groups with a history of similar tactics—like protests or lobbying— readily form alliances, even for different causes. Visionaries struggling against skepticism can gain support by disguising radical ideas behind conventional specifications instead of trying to convince others the idea will work. Shared tactics create bonds and open minds.

 

- Meredith Perry had an original idea for wireless energy transmission but faced resistance from experts. To gain allies, she tempered her radical vision by focusing on how the technology could work rather than why it was important. This made her idea seem less implausible and shocking, allowing her to get expert collaborators and funding.

- Originals often have to become “tempered radicals” to succeed. They tone down radical ideas and pitch them in more appealing ways to draw in mainstream support. Explaining how rather than why can make extreme views seem more moderate and practical.

- Josh Steinman used the “foot-in-the-door” technique to open the Navy up to outside innovation. He led with a small, tempered request before revealing his bigger vision. This allowed him to gain key allies to champion the idea.

- The Occupy Wall Street movement likely failed because it refused to temper its radicalism. Its extreme tactics and positioning alienated potential allies. Broadening methods and rebranding as “The 99 Percent” could have drawn more mainstream support.

- In the women's suffrage movement, allies like Victoria Woodhull undermined the cause with their radical agendas and reputations. Outsiders judged the movement by its most extreme elements, damaging its reputation and support. Tempering radicalism by avoiding such alliances could have helped the movement succeed sooner.

- Relationships exist on two axes: positive-negative and ambivalent (both positive and negative). Pure enemies or allies are on the extremes, but "frenemies" in the middle can be the most damaging. It's often better to work with clear opponents than ambivalent figures who sometimes support you and sometimes undermine you.

 

- Lucy Stone had ambivalent relationships with Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, leaders of the women's suffrage movement. Though they had collaborated, Stone objected to some of their extremist tactics and partners. They had also undermined her at times. 

- Research shows that ambivalent relationships can be more stressful and unhealthy than negative relationships. It is hard to predict how people will act in ambivalent relationships, requiring constant vigilance. Stone understood the risks of allying with Anthony and Stanton.

- However, converting opponents and "frenemies" into allies can be very effective. They have to work hard to overcome initial doubts, so they become strong supporters. They also understand counterarguments well and can persuade others. Stone sought to convert opponents like Julia Ward Howe and Frances Willard into allies.

- Stone addressed her hecklers directly and invited them to her speeches. She helped turn young men ripping down her posters into allies. Her persuasive arguments and appeals to shared values like love of family helped convert opponents.

- Frances Willard was originally afraid of and opposed to Stone and Anthony. But over time, she came to love and honor them for pioneering the way for her and others. Willard helped ally the temperance and suffrage movements, using her ability to persuade and convert to advance the cause.

- The key lesson is that converting opponents and "frenemies" into true allies and supporters can be very powerful. Though risky, ambivalent relationships may be worth cultivating to turn rivals into advocates. Familiarity and shared experiences over time can help foster understanding and forge strong alliances.

 

- The Lion King was almost never made. Studio executives had little confidence in the original idea of "Bambi in Africa with lions."

- The writers had to begin with lions as their starting point. Had they started with the familiar story of Hamlet, they would have ended up with an animated knockoff. Beginning with a novel template was key to originality but posed a challenge. 

- According to creativity expert Justin Berg, the starting point in generating ideas shapes the path for the rest of the concept. Beginning with something familiar, like a three-ring binder, leads to conventional ideas. Beginning with something unfamiliar, like rollerblades, fosters more original ideas.

- The most promising ideas start from novelty and then add familiarity. The Lion King did this when a producer suggested it was like Hamlet, giving executives a familiar reference point to understand the new concept. The writers then incorporated elements of Hamlet into their story.

- In the suffrage movement, the justice argument for women's right to vote was radical but failed to resonate. Frances Willard reframed the issue as a "home protection ballot," linking suffrage to the familiar goal of temperance. This argument was particularly effective in the Western states. 

- Radical thinking is often needed to conceive an original idea. But mediators are then needed to translate the idea for a wider audience by adding familiar elements. Frances Willard played this role in the suffrage movement, enabling women to gain voting rights.

The key themes are:

1) Begin with novelty, then add familiarity. This fosters original yet practical ideas. 

2) Radical thinking sparks new ideas but familiarity helps them spread. Mediators translate radical ideas for mainstream audiences.

3) The starting point in generating ideas shapes the path. Unfamiliar starting points lead to more original ideas than familiar ones. But the end result benefits from familiar elements.

4) Frances Willard offers an example of a mediator who translated a radical idea (women's suffrage) into familiar terms (home protection) to enable its spread. Her leadership and reframing were key to the movement's success.

 

- Frances Willard was able to gain credibility with temperance activists by framing women’s suffrage in familiar religious terms and values they already held. She presented suffrage as a means to pursue temperance, not as an end in itself. This approach of linking new ideas to existing values and framing them in a palatable way is an effective persuasion technique.  

- Willard took a “tempered radical” approach, advocating for progressive causes in a way that did not seem too radical. Her rhetorical strategies offer two key lessons: 1) Link your agenda to audiences’ existing values rather than trying to change their ideals. 2) Transparency is not always best; sometimes ideas need to be reframed for audiences. The “sweet spot” is pushing the envelope without tearing it.

- Lucy Stone also used tempered rhetoric, referencing justice and equality with suffragists but framing suffrage in more traditional terms of women’s societal contributions for general audiences. This moderate, palatable argument was most effective for recruiting new members to the movement.

- Within the suffrage movement, conflicts between the more radical and more tempered factions hampered progress. But eventually, younger members who did not remember the original divisions wanted to unite. Leaders like Stone and Anthony came to see the value of a unified movement with a tempered message. Though Stone and Anthony were never personally reconciled, they came to respect each other’s contributions.

- After Stone’s death, her legacy of tempered radicalism and coalition-building helped unite the movement under Carrie Chapman Catt. However, the movement later split again under the radical leadership of Alice Paul. But it was Catt’s progressive yet tempered leadership that eventually led to the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. 

- Stone’s model of tempered radicalism and coalition-building was essential to the suffrage movement’s ultimate success. Her message to “make the world better” helped guide the movement to victory, even after her death.

 

- Jackie Robinson was the first black player in Major League Baseball. He was known for taking risks, including stealing home plate 19 times, the record in the modern era.

- An analysis of baseball brothers found that younger siblings were more likely to attempt steals and succeed at them. They were also more likely to get hit by pitches and participate in high-risk sports. This suggests younger siblings may be generally more prone to taking risks.

- The top three base stealers of home plate—Jackie Robinson, Rod Carew, and Paul Molitor—were all younger siblings. Half of the 10 players to steal 70+ bases in two seasons were younger siblings.

- A study of scientific revolutions found that laterborn scientists were more likely to endorse radical new theories, like those of Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, and Einstein. They were also much more likely to support evolutionary theory before and after Darwin. This suggests laterborns may be more rebellious in challenging the status quo.

- In sum, being a younger sibling seems to correlate with a propensity for risk-taking and rebellion against social norms. This tendency fueled progress in baseball and science by empowering certain individuals to defy conventions. As the saying goes, “To become original, we have to be willing to take some risks.”

The key message is that younger siblings and laterborns appear predisposed to take more chances and challenge prevailing beliefs. This rebellious spirit has driven social and intellectual progress at critical junctures. Overall, the essay highlights how birth order may shape personality in subtle yet consequential ways.

 

- Research shows that younger children, or “laterborns,” are more likely to champion radical new ideas and take risks than firstborn children. Laterborns are twice as likely to support major scientific revolutions and political upheavals. 

- Jackie Robinson, who challenged segregation before the civil rights movement, showed a willingness to take risks that came from a sense of purpose rather than calculating the best outcome. This tendency to rebel against the status quo can be influenced by birth order.

- While firstborn children initially have advantages like higher education and income, laterborns have faster career growth because they are willing to take more risks and switch jobs. Laterborns are less interested in authority, conformity, and standard measures of achievement.

- Although birth order does not determine personality, it affects the likelihood of developing in a particular way. Hundreds of studies show laterborns are more open to original ideas and rebellion. However, many factors contribute to development, and there are exceptions.

- Siblings within the same family are often very different from each other. Even identical twins raised together are no more similar than twins raised apart. Adopted siblings are not especially alike. This can be explained by “niche picking,” where children establish their own identities by avoiding direct competition with their siblings.

- The firstborn child initially identifies with the parents, but the second child must find another way to stand out. The younger child is more likely to rebel and forge an unconventional path. The age gap between children also influences their development.

- While we can’t change birth order itself, we can cultivate original thinking in any child through parenting practices, role models, and environment. Nurture plays a strong role in determining whether children rebel constructively or destructively.

 Here are the key points from the passage:

1) Brothers who were 2-5 years apart in age were more likely to differentiate themselves by choosing different pursuits or career paths than brothers closer in age. Jackie Robinson distinguished himself from his older brother, a track star, by winning the NCAA broad jump and excelling in other sports. 

2) Comedians are more likely to be rebellious and original thinkers. An analysis of Comedy Central’s list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics found that 44 were lastborn children, compared to only 20 firstborns. Lastborns were 83% more likely to become comedians than chance would predict. Their older siblings often chose more conventional careers. 

3) Laterborn children often face more lenient parenting and rules. As parents gain experience, they tend to be less strict. Laterborn children also spend more time with siblings as role models instead of primarily emulating parents like firstborns do. Jackie Robinson faced less discipline and responsibility as the youngest of five children. Comedian Lizz Winstead had much more freedom as the youngest of five in a conservative family. Her parents were “too exhausted” to prevent her rebellious behavior.

4) Greater freedom and autonomy can nurture original thinking in children of any birth order. Only children also tend to be protected and identify with their parents like firstborns, but they have more freedom like lastborns. They are thus also prone to becoming “radicals.”

5) The direction in which children channel their originality depends on other factors beyond birth order and parenting style. The next part of the passage explores why Jackie Robinson abandoned a life of gangs and crime to become an activist, and what determines whether children use their freedom constructively or destructively.

The key conclusions are:

1) Birth order and parenting have a significant influence on whether siblings differentiate themselves through their interests and pursuits. Laterborns and children with more lenient parenting are particularly prone to rebellious thinking and originality.

2) However, birth order itself does not determine whether that originality and rebellion will be positive or negative. Other shaping factors are also important in channeling children toward constructive or antisocial behavior.

 

Researchers compared Holocaust rescuers and bystanders who lived in the same towns but did not help Jews. Though the groups were similar in many ways, a key difference was how their parents disciplined them as children. The rescuers' parents were more likely to use reasoning and explanations that highlighted how the child's behavior affected others. This helped instill empathy, guilt, and a sense of moral obligation in the children. 

Studies show that emphasizing consequences for others can motivate both children and adults to better behavior. For example, signs asking hospital staff to wash hands "for your patients" led to much higher rates of hand-washing than signs asking them to wash hands "for your health." Thinking of others prompts consideration of moral values and responsibilities.

A key turning point for Jackie Robinson came when a mechanic explained how Robinson's behavior hurt his mother. Once Robinson considered the impact on his mother, he left his neighborhood gang.

To build moral values in children, it's important how parents react not just to misbehavior but also to good behavior. Praising a child's character ("You're a helpful person") is more effective in promoting generosity than praising the behavior ("That was a helpful thing to do"). Character praise helps children internalize moral traits as part of their identity. Though effective for 8-year-olds, such praise may not influence 5-year-olds or 10-year-olds, who may have less developed or more fixed self-concepts.

In summary, then, parents can foster empathy, guilt, moral values, and helpfulness in children through reasoned explanations that highlight consequences for others, character praise, and by giving children autonomy to question rules. These techniques help children develop their own moral code and see themselves as moral individuals.

 

- Appeals to character and identity can have a lasting impact, especially on children and young people who are still forming their self-concepts. Referring to positive identities (e.g. “be a helper” rather than just “help”) can motivate both children and adults to behave ethically. 

- While parents play an important role in children's development, they are not always the most influential role models for nurturing originality. Studies show that mentors and role models outside the family have a bigger impact on people's aspirations to create change.

- Both real and fictional role models can inspire originality by elevating people's aspirations and making the impossible seem possible. Studies show that exposure to stories emphasizing original achievement and accomplishment is linked to higher rates of innovation decades later.

- The Harry Potter series is an example of a work of fiction that provides role models for originality and moral values. By seeing the main characters face discrimination and adversity, readers can develop empathy and become open to marginalized groups. Strong identification with such heroes of originality may even influence the development of people's interests and life paths.

- In summary, while parenting shapes children's development in many ways, role models outside the family—including fictional characters—can be uniquely positioned to nurture originality and a desire to positively impact the world. By elevating aspirations and embedding moral values, these role models make the extraordinary seem within reach.

 

- Edwin Land, the founder of Polaroid, was a visionary inventor known for his original thinking. However, Polaroid failed to foster a culture of originality and dissent within the company. 

- Polaroid fell victim to groupthink, the tendency for groups to seek consensus and discourage dissent in order to maintain cohesion and harmony. According to Irving Janis, groupthink caused policy disasters like the Bay of Pigs invasion.

- However, later research found little evidence that group cohesion actually causes groupthink. Cohesive groups are not necessarily more prone to poor decision making or less receptive to dissent. In fact, cohesive groups can benefit from strong communication and the willingness to challenge each other.

- Groupthink is more likely caused by other factors, like the failure to consider alternatives or give proper weight to dissenting opinions. The use of "devil's advocates" is often ineffective. It is better to encourage people to share authentic concerns and complaints.

- To prevent groupthink, organizations need to value original thinking and dissent from the beginning. They should seek minority opinions, consider alternatives, and give dissenting voices a fair hearing. Strong cultures are not necessarily "cults"  prone to poor decisions; cohesive groups can be quite effective when they also value diversity of thought.

- In summary, when compelling role models for originality, they expand our awareness of niches that we had never considered. Instead of causing us to rebel because traditional avenues are closed, the protagonists in our favorite stories may inspire originality by opening our minds to unconventional paths.

 

- Baron and colleagues studied startups and found three common organizational models used by founders: professional (focus on skills), star (focus on potential), and commitment (focus on cultural fit).

- The commitment model was the most successful, with zero failures. It also led to the highest chance of an IPO. This success continued even after founders were replaced by new CEOs.

- However, commitment models often struggle as companies mature. They tend to become more insular and homogeneous over time, making it hard to recognize the need for change or incorporate diverse perspectives. This can hamper innovation and adaptation. 

- Polaroid is a good example. Its strong commitment culture and Edwin Land's vision led to early success with instant film and cameras. But as the market changed, Polaroid struggled. Land became less open to outside input and favored "devoted followers." He resisted changes like digital photography. 

- Divergent thinking and dissent are critical for companies in volatile, changing markets. But leaders often favor consensus and advice from like-minded colleagues. Including dissenting opinions, even "wrong" ones, leads to better decisions by spurring examination of the issues. Dissent helps companies detect problems, find new solutions, and make higher-quality choices.

- So while commitment cultures fuel early success, they need mechanisms to incorporate diverse, dissenting views as companies grow and face more complex challenges. This helps avoid the stagnation and "groupthink" that can doom once-innovative companies.

In summary, the key takeaways are: commitment cultures drive startup success but can limit mature companies; dissent and divergent thinking are vital for adaptation; and failure to change can lead to decline, as in Polaroid's case. The most successful companies find ways to maintain a strong, mission-driven culture while also embracing outside perspectives and new ideas.

 Here is a summary of the key qualifications and factors that led the company to reconsider John:

1. John's instant movie camera was a commercial failure despite being technically clever. It could only capture a few minutes of footage compared to hours of recording time offered by competitors. The effort resulted in $600 million in losses and John was removed from his leadership role. 

2. Although John's beliefs were firmly embedded in Polaroid's culture, the company was not built to adapt to changes. It continued focusing on instant film products to earn profits rather than innovating, which led to its downfall. 

3. Dissenting opinions were not welcomed at Polaroid. Executives were overconfident in the company's ability to predict future customer needs and resisted ideas that challenged the status quo. Employees who voiced different views were marginalized. 

4. External expertise and partnerships were dismissed in favor of relying on Polaroid's internally developed technology and products. The CEO rejected proposals to acquire startups with new capabilities and technologies. This "not invented here" mentality limited Polaroid's ability to adapt.

5. Polaroid's culture valued loyalty over honesty and openness. Decision makers scoffed at dissenting projections and data that contradicted their views. They failed to recognize the threats facing their business model and technology.

6. In contrast, Bridgewater Associates, a successful investment firm, has a culture that actively seeks out dissenting opinions. Employees are expected to openly challenge each other and leadership. Differing viewpoints are encouraged to promote innovative thinking. 

7. Bridgewater's culture of dissent and commitment to shared values has fueled its long term success. By inviting critical feedback, the firm has made investment decisions that others missed and gained a competitive advantage. Its culture of openness and honesty has built trust and cohesion across the organization.

In summary, Polaroid failed due to overconfidence in its leaders and a culture that discouraged dissent. In contrast, Bridgewater demonstrates how building a culture based on honesty, openness to dissent, and shared values can drive long term success. By reconsidering candidates like John who thought differently, Polaroid may have avoided its downfall.

 

- Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, believes radical transparency and idea meritocracy are key to avoiding groupthink. 

- Assigning a “devil’s advocate” to argue against the majority view is a common technique for fostering dissent. However, research shows this approach is not very effective. People assigned to play this role do not argue consistently or forcefully enough. And group members tend not to take them seriously.

- It is more effective to find authentic dissenters - people who genuinely hold a minority view. Authentic dissenters stimulate more creative thinking and higher quality solutions. They are also perceived as more likable by group members.

- In 2012, Dalio sent a poll asking Bridgewater employees to name colleagues who were not speaking up enough. This poll revealed areas of genuine disagreement within the company and spurred debate.

- Dalio then hosted a discussion with employees who had strong positive and negative reactions to the poll. They debated for over an hour, eventually reaching consensus that radical transparency and accountability were important to avoid groupthink.

- By building a culture where people constantly encourage dissent, Dalio aims to foster idea meritocracy and shield against conformity and bad decision making. Radical transparency is key.

- The summary highlights how finding authentic dissent, rather than assigning “devil’s advocates,” and promoting open debate can help combat groupthink and lead to better decisions. Dalio has implemented this approach at Bridgewater to encourage merit-based thinking.

 

The author argues that while most leaders want employees to bring solutions rather than problems, this approach can discourage dissent and lead to groupthink. David Hofmann, an organizational psychologist, found that a culture focused on solutions tends to become a culture of advocacy where differing perspectives are not considered. The author gives the example of the space shuttle Columbia disaster, which may have been prevented if more inquiry had happened. 

To avoid groupthink, the author says leaders need ways to surface dissenting voices, like Google’s “Canaries” program. Ray Dalio of Bridgewater takes this further, actually wanting employees to bring him problems. At Bridgewater, employee “believability” on different topics is tracked, and opinions are weighted accordingly. While all opinions are welcome, not all are valued equally. 

The author discusses an example where two Bridgewater principles came into conflict. An employee, Ashley, pointed out that some were misinterpreting Bridgewater’s principles. A senior leader, Greg, called her out for not providing enough context, violating another principle about seeing both the forest and the trees. Another manager, Trina, thought Greg made the wrong call and it might discourage dissent. However, at Bridgewater even senior leaders can be challenged. Trina told Greg her perspective, and after reflection he agreed he was wrong. The author argues this shows Bridgewater’s ability to detect and correct errors.

In summary, the key message is that leaders should not just encourage solutions but promote an environment where problems and dissenting voices are surfaced. This helps avoid groupthink and leads to better decisions, as shown in the example from Bridgewater.

 

- Trina gave honest feedback criticizing Greg, the CEO, for dismissing Ashley’s concerns. Trina was not punished for this, showing Bridgewater’s commitment to meritocracy over authority.

- Greg and Trina collaborated to share their disagreement as a case study with the whole company. This forced them to understand each other’s perspectives instead of just advocating for themselves. 

- The author believes that Ray Dalio’s openness to feedback and critical opinions, especially early on, has been key to Bridgewater’s success. The author challenges Dalio on the lack of prioritization in Bridgewater’s principles.

- Dalio agrees the principles should be ranked. He says the principles are a way to categorize common life events and determine how to respond. Though there are many, the top principle is to think for yourself.  

- Dalio acknowledges the need to clarify which principles are most important, like whether leaders should share critical opinions openly or hold back to avoid discouraging others. The author was concerned about offending Dalio with the feedback but he appreciated the input.

- The key themes are radical transparency, meritocracy, continuously improving through feedback, and independent thinking. Bridgewater’s culture of questioning assumptions and authority, while risky, has been crucial to their success. Overall, the passage shows Dalio’s openness to criticism and willingness to keep learning and improving.

 

Lewis Pugh, a world-record holding cold-water swimmer, was attempting to complete the first swim across the North Pole. Although Pugh was known for his ability to elevate his body temperature in anticipation of cold swims, the frigid Arctic waters posed lethal risks. Two days before the swim, a practice swim caused Pugh to lose feeling in his hands for four months. Instead of visualizing success, Pugh began imagining failure and death. However, his fear and questioning whether he would survive did not stop him from attempting and completing the swim. 

To understand courage in the face of uncertainty and fear, the strategies of strategic optimism and defensive pessimism can be examined. Strategic optimists remain calm and set high expectations. Defensive pessimists expect the worst and imagine everything that can go wrong. Although defensive pessimists feel anxious, their negative thinking helps them prepare and prevents disappointment. Leaders and activists like Martin Luther King Jr. used defensive pessimism to prepare for the challenges of fighting injustice. Technology leaders have also used defensive pessimism to convince engineers to make radical changes.

In summary, negative thinking and expecting failure does not always lead to anxiety and inaction. For some, like Lewis Pugh and other successful leaders, defensive pessimism helps fuel preparation and courage. Although their inner experiences are filled with self-doubt and uncertainty, their ability to act in the face of potential failure allows them to rock the boat and challenge the status quo.

 

- Most people think optimism is better than pessimism, but defensive pessimists, who consider worst-case scenarios, can perform just as well as optimists. 
- Experiments show defensive pessimists do better when they envision failure rather than success or relaxation. Thinking about potential problems helps them feel in control and prepares them to succeed. 
- Public speaking scares many people. Telling people to "calm down" is common advice but not very effective. Reframing fear as excitement leads to better performance and confidence. 
- Saying "I'm excited" before speaking led to 17% more persuasive and 15% more confident speeches. Saying "I'm excited" before a math test led to 22% higher scores. 
- Singing "Don't Stop Believin'" in public, people scored 80% when told to get excited versus 69% for the control group and 53% when told to acknowledge anxiety. Excitement activates the "go system" while anxiety triggers the "stop system."
- For uncommitted action, optimism and excitement are better. For committed action, defensive pessimism and confronting fear are better. Envisioning worst cases motivates preparation and makes the situation feel more in control. 
- Lewis Pugh used defensive pessimism for previous swims but struggled after a "disastrous test swim" at the North Pole. With commitment wavering, a different strategy was needed.

So in summary, depending on the level of commitment to an action, different strategies are most effective for managing fear and performing well. When not yet committed, optimism and reframing fear as excitement are effective. When already committed, defensive pessimism and confronting fear are effective motivation. The key is activating the "go system" versus the "stop system."

 

- Lewis Pugh struggled with regulating his own fear and defensive pessimism before attempting long-distance swims. To activate his “go system” and get excited for a swim, a friend suggested three strategies: focus on supporters, remember his motivation to protect the environment, and think of his legacy. After following this advice, Pugh successfully completed an 18-minute swim in freezing water. 

- Many leaders have to activate others’ “go systems” and overcome their fear and apathy. Srdja Popovic, who led the movement to overthrow the Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic, trained activists in non-violent protest methods. He advised starting with small acts of resistance to build momentum, rather than big risks. Popovic dedicated himself to training activists in other countries as well.

- When Josh Silverman became CEO of Skype, employees were demoralized and skeptical of his goal to release an new video calling feature. To inspire them, Silverman articulated a vision of how the feature could bring people together. However, he knew his words alone wouldn’t be enough. Instead, he invited Skype users to share stories of how the product positively impacted their lives. Hearing these authentic stories from customers helped employees understand the vision and become excited to achieve it. With this inspiration, Skype released the new feature on schedule and soon grew rapidly.

- In summary, leaders can activate others’ “go systems” and motivate original thinking by:

1) Helping them focus on reasons to take action (supporters, motivation, legacy)

2) Starting with small acts of progress rather than big risks 

3) Articulating an inspiring vision 

4) Outsourcing inspiration to authentic stories from those affected. Combining a leader’s vision with stories from users or customers is especially impactful.

This approach of outsourcing inspiration from a vision to stories from those affected is a compelling way for leaders to overcome fear, apathy, and motivate others to achieve original goals.

 

- To activate people and overcome fear of standing up alone, it is effective to give them a symbol that shows they are part of a larger group. The clenched fist symbol used in Serbia and Egypt served this purpose, showing people they were not alone in opposing the regime.

- Even having a small number of allies can help reduce fear and encourage non-conformity. In Asch's experiments, having just one dissenter in a group greatly reduced people's tendency to go along with an obviously incorrect majority opinion. Knowing you have allies makes it easier to reject the crowd. 

- Displaying small acts of resistance that show the breadth of opposition can help overcome fear. Examples include Chilean's slowing down traffic, Polands wheelbarrowing TVs, and Syria's red fountains. These show people the opposition is widespread, so they feel safer joining.

- Humor and "dilemma actions" that mock oppressors are effective for overcoming fear. They turn fear into laughter and put oppressors in a lose-lose situation where any response makes them look foolish. Examples include Otpor's pranks on Milosevic and Syria's Ping-Pong ball protest. Humor makes fear fade and shows the silliness of the target of rebellion.

- The surgeons' "Attending *sshole of the Week" award is an example of using humor to overcome fear in an ordinary work environment. Mocking abusive authorities made their behavior less demoralizing and gave the surgeons courage to take further action.

In summary, the key lessons are: provide symbols and small acts of resistance to show people they are not alone; use humor and dilemma actions to turn fear into laughter and mock oppressors; and build allies, even in small numbers, to find strength and courage. Overcoming fear is key to inspiring action and rebellion.

 

- The story begins by describing Srdja Popovic, a Serbian activist who helped lead the nonviolent movement Otpor! that brought down Slobodan Milosevic’s authoritarian regime. Popovic advocated using humor and laughter to combat fear and motivate people to take action. 

- The story then describes how Otpor! organized an event on New Year's Eve 2000 where they told people the Red Hot Chili Peppers would perform, but instead the event featured a somber message about the need to take action and make changes. This helped convey a sense of urgency that motivated people.

- Research shows that successfully creating change requires establishing a sense of urgency - people need to believe that change needs to happen now. Over 50% of leaders fail to do this, clinging to the status quo. Otpor! used slogans like "It's time" and "He's finished" to establish urgency.

- A study on choices around plant closures shows that how options are framed dramatically impacts risk preferences. When options are framed as gains, people tend to be risk averse and prefer a sure gain. But when options are framed as losses, people become risk seeking to avoid a guaranteed loss. This is known as loss aversion.

- To motivate change, it is better to frame the issue around the losses of not changing rather than the gains of changing. When change seems risky, focusing on gains won't work as well as focusing on guaranteed losses. Establishing the urgency of change is more compelling. 

- Examples show how focusing on losses and threats can motivate action. Merck's CEO asked executives to come up with ideas to put the company out of business, motivating them to take risks and innovate to avoid these losses. Powerful speeches often first establish "what is" - the problematic status quo - before envisioning "what could be".

- In summary, to counter apathy and motivate action, change agents should first cultivate dissatisfaction with the status quo by showing what's wrong with the present. Focusing on losses and threats, not gains, is the most compelling way to drive people out of their comfort zone. Establishing a sense of urgency is key.

 

The key message is that expressing anger through venting or retaliation often makes the anger worse and leads to more aggression. The research shows that venting anger by hitting a punching bag or screaming increases subsequent aggression. In contrast, distraction or relaxation techniques are more effective for reducing anger and aggression. 

The examples illustrate this well:

1) Martin Luther King Jr. trained civil rights activists in nonviolent protest using role-playing exercises to help them manage anger in a constructive way. Venting anger through violence would undermine their cause.

2) An experiment found that people who vented their anger by hitting a punching bag after receiving criticism were more aggressive later toward the person who criticized them. In contrast, people who distracted themselves were less aggressive.

3) The activists Srdja Popovic trained people in nonviolent protest using role-playing to help them anticipate and manage anger and aggression. Venting anger through violence would undermine their cause.

4) Successful activists and leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Srdja Popovic were able to be “simultaneously hot- and cool-headed.” They expressed anger to motivate action but managed it to pursue their goals effectively. Unmanaged anger and aggression often lead to less effective action.

In summary, the key to managing anger and using it constructively is not venting but channeling it toward your goals through discipline, empathy, and nonviolent action. Distraction and relaxation techniques can help reduce anger, but the ultimate goal should be cultivating “hot- and cool-headed” leadership.

 

- Venting anger often makes people angrier and more aggressive. It activates the “go system” in the brain that spurs attack, while reducing the “stop system” that inhibits aggression.  
- In studies, people who vented anger became more aggressive, not just toward their initial target but also innocent bystanders. Venting anger feeds anger rather than extinguishing it.
- The civil rights movement trained activists to avoid venting anger and instead respond constructively. Venting anger focuses attention on the perpetrator of injustice and spurs retaliation, while a constructive response focuses on the victims and aims to remedy injustice.  
- Otpor!, a movement that helped overthrow Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia, avoided venting anger against Milosevic. Instead, they displayed images of Serbian victims of his rule to spur “empathetic anger” and a desire to make change to prevent more victims. This helped motivate and unite Serbians against Milosevic.
- Originals who want to improve the world often have to sacrifice some personal happiness and enjoyment in the short term. But in the long run, creating positive change leads to a deeper satisfaction. 
- To increase your originality: Question the status quo; generate more ideas; immerse yourself in new domains; strategically procrastinate; seek peer feedback; balance risks; highlight criticisms of your ideas; repeat and reframe ideas to make them more familiar; speak to disagreeable allies with shared methods; and express extreme ideas in more tempered terms.

The key messages are: venting anger often backfires and reduces originality, while constructive responses that aim to remedy injustice can spur motivation for positive change. Fostering “empathetic anger” for victims rather than venting anger at perpetrators is a more effective strategy for motivation and progress. Expressing unconventional ideas in moderate terms and working with principled allies who share your methods but not necessarily your goals are good strategies for championing original ideas.

 

To change people’s minds, appeal to values or beliefs they already hold. Use a “Trojan horse” to mask a vision behind a request they’ll agree to. Position your idea as a means to an end they care about. If you’re seen as extreme, let moderates take the lead. 

Motivate yourself differently depending on your conviction. When committed, focus on remaining progress to energize yourself. When uncertain, think of progress made so far—you’ve come too far to quit now.  

Don’t try to relax when anxious. Turn anxiety into positive feelings like interest or enthusiasm. Think why you want to challenge the status quo and the good that could result.

Focus on victims, not perpetrators. Think of victims to become empathetic and channel anger constructively. Help victims rather than punish perpetrators.

Find allies. Even one ally dramatically boosts your motivation to act. Work together to tackle the problem.  

Remember that without action, the status quo persists. Consider exit, voice, persistence or neglect. Speaking up may be best if you have control. If not, explore options to expand influence or leave.

Run an innovation tournament for novel ideas. Call for proposals to meet a need or solve a problem. Have employees evaluate ideas and advance the best. Winners get resources to implement them.

Picture yourself as the enemy to create urgency. Brainstorm how to ruin the company or destroy a key offering. Discuss the biggest threats and turn them into opportunities.

Invite employees across functions and levels to pitch ideas. Involve more people in idea generation to tap their creativity and make them better judges of others’ ideas.

Hold an “opposite day.” Groups challenge widely held assumptions and present opposite viewpoints.

Ban words like “like,” “love” and “hate” which allow visceral reactions without thinking. Explain reasoning instead. 

Hire for cultural contribution, not fit. Identify missing attributes and prioritize them in hiring to enhance culture.

Do entry interviews, not just exit ones. Talk to new hires about what brought them in and would keep them. Ask them to investigate practices to keep or change.

Ask for problems, not solutions. Review and solve the most important problems. Solutions often reflect limited knowledge. Problems tap into more.

Unearth dissenters; don’t just assign them. Find those with genuinely different views and invite them to present. Appoint an information manager to identify dissenting team members.

Welcome criticism. Invite public criticism to show you value feedback and set the tone for open communication of unpopular ideas.  

Ask children what role models would do. Looking through role models’ eyes frees them to act.

Link good acts to moral character. Praise children for being helpful people. Ask them to be good sharers or helpers to encourage the identity.  

Explain how bad acts hurt others. Help children see the impact of wrongdoing on others to build empathy, guilt, and the will to make amends.

Focus on values over rules. Values encourage children to develop their own principles. Discuss why values matter and ask why they're important to children.  

Create opportunities for children to develop original interests. Use "jigsaw classrooms" where each child contributes a unique part, reducing groupthink and encouraging new perspectives. Ask how historical figures’ lives might differ in other times and places.

 

- The key message of this chapter is that originality requires “creative destruction,” or challenging accepted wisdom and practices. Conformity leads to stagnation, while nonconformity fuels originality and progress.

- Originality involves coming up with ideas or behaviors that are both novel and useful. Original people tend to be imaginative, playful, curious, and open-minded. They are willing to abandon or replace familiar routines, habits, and ways of thinking. However, people have a tendency toward “kleptomnesia,” or inadvertently stealing others’ ideas while believing they are original. 

- Several factors contribute to conformity and discourage originality:
		
		
- Familiarity and inertia: We tend to stick with what we know and what’s expected out of habit and inertia. For example, people often use the default Internet browser that comes preinstalled on their computers.
		
- System justification: We have a psychological motivation to defend and justify the status quo. Challenging the system can make people uncomfortable.
		
- Vuja de: The opposite of déjà vu. We fail to see old things with a fresh perspective. Familiarity breeds blindness.

 - Child prodigies and “the world’s most excellent sheep” demonstrate how the education system often breeds conformity over originality. Although some gifted children maintain their originality and curiosity into adulthood, “only a fraction of gifted children become revolutionary adult creators.”

- In sum, becoming original requires fighting against human tendencies toward habit, familiarity, and conformity. It means cultivating an ability to see with “vuja de”—to gain a new and fresh perspective on familiar people, places, and situations. Originality arises from a willingness to challenge and replace existing systems, rules, and practices.

 

- Successful cultures, groups, and societies tend to value achievement, support risk-taking, and celebrate creative individuals. They provide platforms for people to express unusual ideas and give them the autonomy and resources to pursue those concepts. 

- Many famous creators and leaders were initially viewed as strange or crazy, but they persevered, fueled by a passion for their work. They had key supporters and collaborators who helped champion their efforts. Examples include Martin Luther King Jr., Pope Julius II, leaders of the American Revolution, and inventors like Edwin Land.

- Entrepreneurship requires a tolerance for risk and a willingness to upset the status quo. Many successful entrepreneurs started their companies while keeping their day jobs, like Phil Knight of Nike and the founders of Google. They saw opportunities that others missed. 

- Successful entrepreneurs develop strategies to “de-risk” risk-taking, such as starting small, failing fast, experimenting, and maintaining optimism in the face of failure. Examples include Sara Blakely of Spanx and Henry Ford. Some entrepreneurs, like Pierre Omidyar of eBay, avoided risk altogether by spotting opportunities with little downside.

- Contrary to popular belief, research shows that entrepreneurs are not necessarily more risk-seeking than others. They take calculated risks, not reckless gambles. Successful entrepreneurs share some qualities with rule-breakers and criminals, but they direct their behavior to more prosocial ends. 

- There is little evidence that personality traits alone predict entrepreneurial success or performance. Success is often dependent on hard work, skill, knowledge, and networking—not just personality. The same is true of leadership: Charisma and proactivity help, but performance and outcomes matter more.

- Some creators and leaders succeed by reframing risks as opportunities. By focusing on the meaningful end goal, the potential upside, and small wins along the way, they are able to take prudent risks and persevere in the face of uncertainty or failure. This mindset can be learned and developed over time.

 Here is a summary of the article:

The article discusses the challenges involved in developing and recognizing highly creative ideas. It highlights several reasons why creative ideas often fail or are rejected:

1. Inventors and creators are prone to overestimating the potential of their own ideas due to biases and ego. They lack objectivity about their creations.  

2. Truly original ideas are rare, strange, and unconventional, so they tend to be less appealing and harder to recognize. People have a bias toward ideas that are familiar and conventional.  

3. Expertise and experience, while valuable, can also make people entrenched in their thinking and less open to new ideas that challenge the status quo. Experts may dismiss unconventional ideas.

4. The creative process involves a lot of trial-and-error, dead-ends, and failures. But people often underestimate the persistence and iteration required to achieve something novel and impactful. They give up too easily.

5. There are many barriers, especially for underrepresented groups, that prevent potentially highly creative people from developing and expressing their talents. Lack of opportunity and bias are obstacles.

The article discusses examples of famous creations and creators that were initially rejected, like Jerry Seinfeld’s show Seinfeld and Beethoven’s music. It highlights the role that certain psychological factors like passion, expertise, openness to experience, and risk-taking play in the creative process, especially for groundbreaking work. Overall, the key message is that recognizing and nurturing highly creative ideas requires battling biases and conventional mindsets to allow for the strange and unexpected. But doing so can lead to great innovations and advances.

 Here is a summary of the article "Out on a Limb":

- The article examines how rebels and change agents who lack status or power can still drive meaningful change in organizations. The authors argue that these "tempered radicals" are able to push for change by building credibility and influence over time using four key strategies:

1. Build expertise and networks. Rebels develop valuable knowledge and connections that make them indispensable to their organizations. For example, Carmen Medina developed expertise in intelligence and built relationships across agencies that allowed her to drive the adoption of Intellipedia. 

2. Use humble language and frame the issue as helping the organization. Rebels are more persuasive when they use tentative, powerless speech and argue that their proposals will benefit others. By framing change as helping the status quo rather than radically altering it, rebels appear less threatening.

3. Start small to fly under the radar, then scale up. Rebels have the most success when they start with small changes that establish the viability and value of their ideas before expanding into more ambitious proposals. This allows them to build up "idiosyncrasy credits" and familiarity that breeds acceptance.

4. Express doubt to seem open-minded. Rebels who convey uncertainty appear more reasonable and open to feedback, making their ideas seem less objectionable. Expressing some doubt and a willingness to listen to others helps rebels build trust and support. 

In summary, the article provides a set of strategies through which organizational rebels and change agents can drive meaningful change despite a lack of status or power. By proceeding tactfully through building expertise and relationships, using persuasive framing and communication, starting small, and conveying openness to input, these "tempered radicals" are able to push for changes that disrupt the status quo.

 

The mere exposure effect refers to how we tend to prefer things simply because we are exposed to them repeatedly. Repeated exposure leads to increased familiarity and liking. This effect seems to operate unconsciously and has been demonstrated in a wide range of contexts, from physical objects to people to ideas. Familiarity does not necessarily breed contempt; it can foster affection and comfort. 

There are four main responses to dissatisfaction or dissent in groups and organizations: exit, voice, persistence, and neglect. Exit means leaving the situation. Voice means speaking up to improve the situation. Persistence means doggedly but constructively working to change the status quo. Neglect means passively allowing suboptimal conditions to persist.

Which responses individuals choose depends on their feelings of commitment to the group or organization and their sense of effectiveness in creating change. Having a supportive manager and an agreeable personality incline people to choose voice over other options. But those in the middle of status hierarchies may avoid voice out of a desire to conform. Strong gender roles and stereotypes also discourage voice, especially for women, who can face backlash for speaking up assertively.

Procrastination allows for “incubation” and can enhance creativity. Putting work off provides time for the mind to subconsciously process information, freeing us up to make new connections. Some degree of distraction and daydreaming, rather than strict focus, seems important for having original insights. Many eminent creators, from Leonardo da Vinci to Martin Luther King Jr., have benefited from strategically delaying progress on and revisiting works in progress. But procrastination must be balanced with action; creative productivity results from an iterative process of delaying and then progressing.

Overall, familiarity, voice, and prudent procrastination—though sometimes seen as inefficient or ineffective—all have underappreciated benefits. When managed well, they can facilitate comfort, spark innovation, prompt action, and catalyze change. Moderation is key: too much of a good thing in any of these domains will likely backfire. But we should not be too quick to dismiss them as worthless or self-indulgent.

 

The article discusses Lucy Stone, a leader in the American women’s suffrage movement. Stone helped found the American Woman Suffrage Association in 1869 and edited the Woman’s Journal, a publication dedicated to women’s rights. However, Stone has received less attention and acclaim than other suffragists like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.  

The author argues that Stone deserves more credit for several reasons:

1) Stone was a pioneering advocate for women’s rights and fought for women’s suffrage decades before the movement gained mainstream support. She gave her first public speech on women’s rights in 1847 and was a leader in the movement for over 40 years.

2) Stone influenced and inspired other prominent suffragists. For example, Susan B. Anthony did not become involved in the movement until meeting Stone in 1852. The author argues Stone’s radical and eloquent advocacy likely inspired Anthony and other early suffragists.

3) Stone helped unify different factions in the women’s movement. In particular, she helped negotiate the merger of two leading suffrage organizations into the National Woman Suffrage Association in 1869, advancing the movement.

4) Stone endured substantial adversity and criticism as an early women’s rights advocate but never wavered in her convictions. The author suggests her dedication and perseverance in the face of opposition was instrumental to the movement’s success.  

In summary, the author argues that Lucy Stone deserves significant credit as an pioneering leader in the American women’s suffrage movement who helped advance and unify the cause for over 40 years despite facing substantial criticism and opposition. The author believes Stone’s instrumental role and influence on other leaders like Susan B. Anthony have been underappreciated.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- Stealing bases in baseball is risky but can provide a strategic advantage by putting runners in scoring position. Stealing home plate is even riskier but can be tremendously impactful. Successful steals of home are rare and require a combination of luck, speed, timing, and guts. 

- Pioneering base-stealers like Ty Cobb and Jackie Robinson were bold players who helped expand how people thought about base running and using athleticism and wits to gain advantages. Their risky maneuvers helped inspire teammates and introduced new dynamics into baseball. 

- While a single stolen base can be significant in a close game, the cumulative effects of an aggressive baserunning approach can yield benefits over the course of a season. Steals keep opponents on their toes and force errors, even when unsuccessful. This suggests there are benefits to boldness and pushing boundaries that may not be immediately apparent.

- There is a analogy between stolen bases in baseball and rebels pushing for social change. In both cases, there are risks to going against the norm, but the potential rewards of success are high. Rebels and base-stealers also open up new possibilities for others by demonstrating what is possible and shaking up established patterns. Their acts, whether successful or not, can inspire and unleash new dynamics.

- This suggests that calculated risk-taking, boundary pushing, and rebel thinking all have important roles to play in fields as diverse as sports, science, social justice, and organizational change. The benefits may emerge over time through complex ripples and tipping points rather than as immediate wins and losses. But without the courage of pioneers to test limits, systems have little opportunity to evolve.

The summary highlights how the analogy between stolen bases and rebel thinking suggests that calculated boldness, boundary pushing, and nonconformity can yield benefits that emerge over time. While risky, these approaches create opportunities for complex, multi-stage gains that would not arise otherwise. Overall, the summary conveys the idea that rebels and catalysts who are willing to "steal home" are key to progress.

 Here is a summary of the information:

- Jacoby Ellsbury’s steal of home against the Yankees on April 26, 2009, was daring and rare, reminiscent of baseball from another era. Stealing home is risky and difficult. 

- Collisions at home plate attempting to score a run are the leading cause of injury for professional baseball players. Ellsbury avoided a collision and slid under the tag to score.

- Ellsbury led the American League in stolen bases that season and again in 2011 and 2013. He is considered one of the best base stealers of his era.

- Base stealing was an important part of baseball strategy in the early days of the sport but declined over time. Maury Wills and Lou Brock revived the stolen base in the 1960s and 1970s. Rickey Henderson is considered the “father of modern base-stealing.”

- Leading base stealers, especially those who have stolen 70 or more bases in multiple seasons, tend to be laterborns, including Henderson, Brock, Vince Coleman, Wills, Ron LeFlore, Omar Moreno, Tim Raines, Willie Wilson, Marquis Grissom, and Kenny Lofton. Laterborns may be more rebellious and risk-taking.

- Jackie Robinson, who broke Major League Baseball’s color barrier, was also a daring base stealer. He helped revive an emphasis on base stealing after World War II.

- Like Robinson, Rod Carew, the third-ranked base stealer of all time, had a daring and aggressive style of play. Paul Molitor, also a great base stealer, was more calculating and strategic.

- Research shows that birth order is a significant influence on personality, interests, and talent. Laterborns are overrepresented in dangerous occupations and among those who challenge authority. Comedians also tend to be laterborns. 

- Among the hundred top comedians ranked by Comedy Central, there were nearly twice as many laterborns as firstborns or only children. Comedians tend to be rebellious and unconventional—traits associated more with laterborns.

 Here is a summary of the working paper by Grant:

•Studies show that people with more older brothers are more likely to be homosexual. The maternal immune hypothesis suggests that a mother's immune system may become sensitized to male antigens with each male fetus and may affect the development of subsequent male fetuses.  Parents also tend to invest less in each child as the number of children increases.

•The youngest children in larger families tend to become comedians. They use humor to seek attention and stand out. Examples include Jim Gaffigan and Lizz Winstead. Only children tend to be higher achieving and have better self-esteem. Middle children tend to be most rebellious.

•Parents discipline the eldest child the most strictly but become more lenient with each subsequent child. The children who face the harshest discipline with a controlling style tend to become most rebellious. Creativity is associated with less strict and controlling parents.

•Guilt can motivate moral behavior. Mentioning the impact of people's actions on others can increase prosocial actions like hand washing among health care workers. Character praise and explanations of impact on others in childhood leads to more prosocial children.

• Role models can inspire by setting an example and making extraordinary achievements seem possible. Many famous leaders and entrepreneurs were inspired by stories and role models, e.g. Malala Yousafzai, Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Sheryl Sandberg, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Ma.

• Exposure to stories of original achievement in childhood is associated with higher motivation for achievement and creativity. Reading the Harry Potter series can even temporarily increase empathy, tolerance, and less prejudiced views in children.

In summary, birth order, parenting styles, motivations, role models, and exposure to inspiring stories in childhood can all shape personality, values, and success later in life. Nurturing, supportive environments that foster curiosity and morality tend to cultivate creativity, leadership, and altruism.

 Here is a summary of the article:

- The article challenges the conventional view that group cohesion and consensus are optimal for group decision making. It argues that dissent and debate can improve the quality of group decisions and prevent “groupthink.” 

- Companies often emphasize cultural fit and homogeneity in hiring and promotion. But this can reduce dissent and reinforce narrow ways of thinking. Polaroid and other companies suffered from this.

- The “groupthink” concept suggests that highly cohesive groups can make poor decisions because they do not consider alternatives and dissenting views. However, groupthink has been criticized as oversimplified. Research shows that dissent and debate can improve group decision making.

- Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund, has formal procedures to encourage dissent and prevent groupthink. Minority dissent has been shown to stimulate creativity and improve decision making. 

- Bringing in outsiders and “devil’s advocates” who are designated to dissent can also help. People should express “strong opinions, weakly held” and bring solutions, not just complaints. 

- A “culture of advocacy” where people feel empowered to dissent and debate respectfully is optimal. Employees who act as “canaries in the coal mine” to detect problems should be valued.

- Knowing people’s preferences and ranks before a discussion can degrade decision quality. Options should be evaluated based on merit, not on who favors them. 

- The article concludes that dissent and open debate, not consensus, are most likely to produce good decisions. Homogeneity should be balanced with diversity of thought.

 

- Leaders need to rock the boat by challenging the status quo, but they also need to provide stability to keep people onboard. Effective change requires a balance of provocation and reassurance. 

- Courage is required to speak up and push for change, but courage is not enough. Leaders also need to regulate their emotions and stay calm under pressure. They need to channel their anxiety, fear, and anger in constructive ways. Strategic optimism and defensive pessimism are two strategies for managing emotions during change.

- It is useful to reframe anxiety as excitement. Thinking of a challenging situation as an opportunity rather than a threat can help motivate and energize people to achieve their goals. The stop system (that inhibits behavior) and the go system (that activates behavior) can be triggered by how situations are framed.

- Humor and surprise can be effective for overcoming resistance to change by catching people off guard and making the familiar seem strange and absurd. Nonviolent protest techniques can also tap into surprises and humor to get people's attention and open their minds.

- Spending time with people directly affected by the change can inspire others by helping them see the change through the beneficiaries' eyes. This outsourcing of inspiration is especially meaningful when combined with an authentic vision for change.

- Minorities and first followers play an important role in overcoming conformity pressures and starting movements. Speaking up and showing solidarity gives permission for others to support the cause. Grassroots support builds momentum from the bottom up.

- Presenting messages that tap into loss aversion or frame the current circumstances as perilous can create a sense of urgency that motivates change. But these messages need to be balanced with a vision of a better future state. The "kill the company" exercise is an example of how to frame the status quo as untenable.

- Great communicators use rhetorical devices like repetition, alliteration, contrast, and metaphor to give their messages emotional resonance and make an impact. Speeches should have a clear structure: surface the status quo as a problem, envision a better future, and issue a call to action.  

- "Tempered radicals" are leaders who express passion for change but do so in ways that resonate with others and keep them onboard. They are "simultaneously hot- and cool-headed." Like method actors, they display the emotions that are strategically appropriate for the situation.

 Here are summaries of the sources:

E. E. Cummings (2013) is a biography of the avant-garde 20th-century poet E. E. Cummings. It describes Cummings's rebellious and rule-breaking poetic style.

Chris Sullivan's article discusses how actor Daniel Day-Lewis engages in an immersive and rigorous process to prepare for his roles. For example, to prepare for the film Gangs of New York, Day-Lewis perfected a New York accent of the 1860s and learned how to butcher cattle. This dedication to his craft has earned Day-Lewis many accolades and awards.

The additional sources discuss the following topics:

- Surface acting and deep acting as strategies for emotional labor and their links to burnout and job performance. Surface acting, faking emotions, is more detrimental. 

- The civil rights movement's use of moral anger to motivate social change. Leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. channeled anger over injustice into nonviolent protest and civic participation.

- The problem with venting anger. Contrary to the myth of "letting off steam," venting anger tends to increase aggression and worsen mood. Distraction and reappraisal are better strategies. However, expressing anger in a constructive way, with a plan for positive change, can be useful.

- Finding purpose and meaning through personally meaningful projects and pursuits, as described in psychologist Brian Little's research on "personal projects." Engaging in a diversity of projects and having a sense of progress or efficacy leads to well-being.

- The use of "innovation tournaments" to elicit new ideas in organizations. Successful tournaments have clear rules, motivate a diversity of participants, and evaluate ideas objectively based on criteria like novelty, feasibility, and potential impact.

- Techniques for spurring new thinking like assuming an "enemy's" perspective, banning critical language, and the Jigsaw Classroom method of collaborative work. The latter gives students part of a task, requiring them to coordinate to solve the whole problem.

- Praise for behavior and character. Praising behavior, actions, and strategies is more likely to encourage a growth mindset and resilience in the face of failure. Praising innate traits or intelligence promotes a fixed mindset.

 Here are the main points summarized:

- Barbra Streisand, an influential female creator, faced hurdles in her career because of her gender. 

- Rena Subotnik argues that creativity requires support and opportunity, which women have historically lacked. 

- Frank Sulloway found that later-born children are more open to unconventional ideas since they have to find their own niche. 

- “Surface acting” refers to faking emotions, while “deep acting” means genuinely cultivating them. Surgeons and teachers often have to engage in surface acting.

- Boris Tadic showed that groups generate more creative ideas when there are opportunities for debate. The “wisdom of crowds” requires independence and diversity.

- Gerard Tellis argues that first movers have an advantage because they can capture mindshare and resources. However, later entrants have the benefit of learning from the first movers’ mistakes.

- “Tempered radicalism” refers to making gradual changes from within organizations by framing ideas as consistent with existing values. 

- Peter Thiel argues we went from an era of scarcity to abundance for most people, but we failed to keep achieving new breakthroughs at a macro scale. He aims to fund ambitious new tech companies.

- The peak “wake-up time” for new insights may be around 8:00 a.m. People are slightly sleep-deprived but still have mental focus. Morning types or “larks” may have an advantage here. 

- There are two main arguments for women’s suffrage: justice and expediency. The expediency argument suggests that giving women the vote would encourage them to support moral reforms. This argument appealed to some opponents.

- The Woman’s Christian Temperance Union fought for women’s suffrage in order to gain political power to advance their moral agenda, including alcohol prohibition.

- Woodhull & Claflin’s Weekly advocated for women’s suffrage as a matter of justice and equal rights. Victoria Woodhull was the first woman to run for U.S. president.

- The “home protection” argument suggested that women voters would have a moderating influence and support more wholesome politics. This line of reasoning appealed to some male voters.

 

- Procrastination and delaying solving problems can enhance creativity by allowing our mind to wander and make unexpected connections. Insight problems that require "aha" moments are particularly suited to this. 

- Leaders should be patient when taking over a new team or organization. Pushing for radical changes too quickly can backfire. It's best to wait until the "midpoint" of an ongoing task or project, when teams become most receptive to new strategies. Rushing major changes or product launches can lead to flops.

- Shared experiences, even of unpleasant things, can strengthen social bonds between people by amplifying both positive and negative feelings. When groups have some overlap in their methods and status but also maintain distinct tactics, they are most likely to form alliances. Too much similarity or difference makes alliances less likely.

- Having the support of allies can buffer against the negative impacts of undermining by detractors. But archenemies, who one would never ally with, are different from ordinary nemeses, who might become allies under some circumstances.

- The receptiveness of groups to new allies depends partly on timing and whether they feel threatened or that their mission is at risk. Suffragists were most able to ally with temperance groups when the groups were recently defeated in their efforts and saw suffrage as a way to advance their cause.

- Unofficial "problem-solving workshops" that bring adversarial groups together, allow them to share perspectives without blaming, and find areas of joint gain can help resolve entrenched conflicts. They were instrumental in facilitating the first Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.

- On average, middle children tend to be the most adept at diplomacy due to vying for attention between dominant older and younger siblings. But there are many exceptions. Birth order only accounts for a small portion of differences between individuals.

 

- Research shows that firstborn children tend to be dominant and assertive. Later-born children, especially the youngest, tend to have the opposite traits.

- Birth order effects are due in part to biological factors. For example, having many older brothers increases the likelihood of being homosexual.

- Youngest children can feel tremendous pressure to meet their parents' unfulfilled expectations, leading to rebellion. This was the case for tennis star Andre Agassi.

- Explaining the impact of children's behavior on others is important for developing empathy and morality. The explanations should be tailored to a child's age and level of understanding. Stating moral principles, not just impacts, has the most lasting effect.

- Praising a child's character can encourage moral behavior, but it must be balanced with discipline and teaching clear standards of right and wrong. Effort praise is better for developing a growth mindset in skills and achievement.

- There are five common "blueprints" for company culture: professional, commitment, star, autocracy, and bureaucracy. Professional and commitment blueprints tend to lead to the most company success and longevity.

- Although criticism is thought to stifle creativity, debate and constructive criticism actually improve the quality and number of new ideas. The same is true for high-performing teams. 

- Changing a company's culture blueprint is very difficult and often leads to higher turnover, lower growth, and higher odds of failure. This is especially true for companies shifting away from a commitment blueprint.

- "Cultural fit" in hiring often leads to a lack of diversity and insular thinking. It should not be used as a proxy for hiring people with shared values and work ethic.

- In summary, the research shows the importance of understanding how relationships, environments, and behaviors shape individuals and groups. Success comes from balancing contrasting needs, such as discipline and praise or consensus and dissent. Changes to established systems should not be taken lightly. And diversity of thought leads to the most productive teams and societies.

 

IDEO values hiring candidates who can improve the company culture rather than focusing solely on cultural fit. They believe dissent and questioning the status quo leads to better decisions and outcomes. To promote transparency, IDEO records all meetings and calls, and criticizes employees who talk behind people's backs. They aim to consider all options before making a decision, rather than settling on a preferred choice too quickly. Research shows that optimistic leaders can negatively impact economic factors like employment rates and GDP. Messages tend to be more effective when delivered by beneficiaries rather than leaders. Curiosity and interest can activate motivation and reduce anxiety in times of change. Playing offense tends to lead to more creative thinking, while playing defense can lead to feeling overwhelmed. Expressing feelings about trauma is most helpful once enough time has passed to process events.
