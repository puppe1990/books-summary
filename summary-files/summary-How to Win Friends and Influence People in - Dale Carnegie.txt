 Here is a summary:

• Dale Carnegie’s advice in How to Win Friends and Influence People is still
relevant today despite major changes in communication technology and speed. 
His principles represent the foundation of effective communication and 
relationship building.

• Dealing with people and building relationships is complex today given the 
multitude of communication channels and expanded networks. However, 
Carnegie’s principles are more important than ever for successful
communication and influence.

• The stakes of communication are higher today. Every interaction, from a 
simple greeting to a business meeting, is an opportunity to positively influence
others. Successful people apply Carnegie’s principles daily.

• Gaining influence and making progress with people require some measure of 
selflessness. The secret is becoming genuinely interested in others, not just
promoting yourself.

• Influential people today must be more than clever communicators. The highest
levels of influence come from generosity, trustworthiness, and helping others.
Influence must be earned, not just borrowed through media exposure or 
celebrity status.

• Carnegie’s principles, like don’t criticize and talk about others’ interests, 
encourage consideration for others and authentic communication. They lead to 
meaningful relationships, trust, leadership, and a distinctive personal brand. 

• The rewards of applying Carnegie’s principles include enduring friendships, 
successful transactions, strong leadership, and a positive reputation. These 
principles help you gain influence by expressing respect, empathy, and grace.

 

- Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People is often called the bestselling self-help book of all time. However, “self-help” was not a term Carnegie used himself. The book's success led to the creation of the self-help genre. 

- The book's principles are more about helping others than just helping yourself. Applying them can allow you to have a bigger positive impact on other people's lives.

- Soft skills, like those taught in the book, are more important than hard skills. Hard skills depend on soft skills to be effective. Executives often fail due to a lack of soft skills, even if they are highly competent in their field.

- Soft skills can be hard to teach since they are not as quantifiable as hard skills. However, Carnegie discovered that altruistic instincts can arise from exercising core desires, like the desire for connection and helping others.

- Today, relational success is measured more by meaning than by how many social media friends or followers you have. When you focus on being meaningful in your interactions, success becomes easier and more sustainable. 

- The principles in How to Win Friends are simple but timeless. Though technology and media have changed a lot since the book was written, human nature has not. Success still depends on your ability to connect with others in an authentic and empathetic way.

- The title of the book can seem inconsistent with its actual content. However, at the time Carnegie wrote it, the ideas of "winning friends" and "influencing people" were more straightforward. You truly had to foster real friendships to have influence over people.

That's the summary and key highlights from the passage on Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People. Let me know if you would like me to explain or expand on any part of the summary.

 

- In the past, the ways for people to connect were limited to face-to-face, letters or telephone. Today, while face-to-face interaction is still preferable, it has become the exception due to the rise of digital communication. 

- While celebrity influence and status existed in the past, today influence can spread instantly and widely through social media and the Internet. Friendship used to be the main way to gain influence, but today influence can be gained more easily through social media, though the impact may be more superficial.

- The author argues that the principles behind gaining real influence remain the same - it should originate from sincerity, empathy and genuine care for others. The author aims to show how Carnegie's principles for gaining influence can be applied in today's digital age.

- People today rely heavily on digital communication like emails, texts and social media. This causes challenges as it is difficult to convey emotions and nonverbal cues. The author argues we should have a balanced mix of personal interaction and digital communication. We should be mindful of how we communicate in each method.

- Details and the little gestures matter a lot, especially in this fast-paced digital age. The ability to express ideas, show leadership and inspire others is still crucial to success today, as Carnegie advocated. 

- We must be careful with our words, especially on public social media. Criticism and complaints that were once private can now spread widely and damage reputations. Words have power and can be used to tear down or build up others. We should avoid criticizing, condemning or complaining about others.

- Examples are given of people who faced consequences for posting criticisms or complaints on social media that spread widely. Digital communication allows us to reach more people quickly but also means we can damage our reputation faster. We must be prudent.

 Here's a summary:

• The Huffington Post described thirteen Facebook posts that resulted in people losing their jobs. Examples included a waitress complaining about customers on Facebook and stadium employees posting derogatory comments about their team.  

• Criticism and judgment seem more common than compassion and grace in today's media. Many are quick to criticize others but slow to admit their own wrongs. This damages relationships and divides people.

• Influential leaders like Abraham Lincoln handle criticism and tense situations with poise and grace. Lincoln was furious when General Meade failed to defeat Lee's army after Gettysburg but never sent Meade the harsh letter he drafted. Lincoln knew that, while the criticism was deserved, sending the letter would damage his influence over Meade.

• People instinctively defend themselves against threats and criticism. The steroid scandal shows that even public figures have trouble admitting fault. Being criticized makes us want to criticize in return rather than have a productive conversation.

• In today's world, our communication can spread globally in seconds. Public figures like Mel Gibson and Jesse Jackson have been hurt by private communications becoming public. We would do well to consider what people might say about our worst private moments before criticizing others.

• It is unwise and unnecessary to criticize others to make your messages more effective or newsworthy. The ability to spread messages widely today is a responsibility, not an excuse to criticize without restraint. Following the principle of not criticizing, condemning or complaining leads to more constructive communication.

 

Responsibility is something that should be accepted with humility, compassion, and trustworthiness. Those who do so tend to rise quickly in their fields because others are willing to listen to them. The most respected people are those who have clear viewpoints but remain compassionate towards those they want to influence.

Forcing change through words alone is coercive and should be avoided. The best way to influence others is by focusing on improving yourself rather than criticizing others. Some ways to do this include:

•Shift your use of media to sharing encouragement and advice rather than just exposing problems or complaining. While informing others of issues is fine, do so in a constructive way. 

•Avoid badmouthing others as a way to make yourself look better. This harms relationships and may burn bridges with potential future collaborators. Competition is good but should be balanced with collaboration.

•Make your communication meaningful by focusing on providing value to others rather than just sharing your own agenda or complaints. No one wants constant negativity. 

•Calm yourself before responding to someone who has upset you. Responding when you're most emotional often leads to responses you later regret. Take time to reflect first.

•Remember that there are always ways you yourself could improve as well. The way you judge others is the way you will be judged. Think about whether ego or wisdom is driving your words.

•Focus on affirming the good in others and in situations rather than just criticizing the bad. This can have a profound impact, as shown in the story of King George VI and his speech therapist Lionel Logue. Logue affirmed the king's strength and courage, helping him to overcome his stutter and become an influential leader.

•Value each person, as shown in the parable of the shepherd leaving 99 sheep to find the one lost sheep. Let others know you value them. We all desire to feel valued and affirmed.

While it can be easy to get caught up in superficial issues and the busyness of life, making the effort to affirm others is powerful and transformative. Focus on what really matters - the people in your life.

 

- Affirming the good in others and showing them genuine concern and respect is important for building influence. 
- Flattery is superficial and meaningless. Affirmation requires understanding someone well enough to know what really matters to them.
- We often miss opportunities to affirm others because we live life on “autopilot.” We need to make an effort to really see people. 
- Focusing on someone’s best qualities and moments can help improve a strained relationship. It shows them their potential and what they can still become.
- Gaining influence requires setting yourself apart through moments of grace, forgiveness and affirmation. These moments create lasting impressions. 
- Affirming others despite their faults is not a show of weakness. It is a means to remind people of the good in themselves and convey belief in their potential. 
- Examples show how affirming adversaries and showing them respect can resolve conflict. Appeals to people’s better nature and shared bonds can overcome divisions.
- The spirit of communication today often lacks dignity. Affirming what is good in others despite the problems between you can propel them to change.

So in summary, affirming others and appealing to their better qualities is a powerful way to gain influence, improve relationships and drive change. It shows a genuine concern for others that looks beyond surface level interactions. Focusing on people's potential and reminding them of the good that exists within can inspire them to become their best selves.

 

- The most effective communicators are those who speak respectfully and positively. They win more influence and support than those who criticize and condemn.

- Today, we can spread positive messages to many people through digital media. But these messages should still be personal and show we value each individual. 

- We all desire to feel valued by others. Whether a message is conveyed to one person or many depends on how each individual receives it.

- A story illustrates how much influence we can have when we affirm others. A father realizes he has been too critical of his young son and resolves to show him more affection and understanding.

- To influence others, connect with their core desires. Steve Jobs tapped into people's desire for an integrated "digital life" with the iMac and its software. Critics mocked him but the public embraced his vision.

- Influencing others requires intuition more than intellect. Emerson could not get a calf into a barn but his housemaid could by offering her finger for it to suck, tapping into its desire for food. She had the intuition Emerson lacked. 

- Those in high-status roles are not necessarily the most influential. Influence depends on relationships and connecting with people, which anyone can do regardless of status or education. It takes insight into others' perspectives and motivations.

- What really matters is intuiting what drives people at their core in order to connect with them, not one's status or formal knowledge. True influence and progress come from affirming what is good and tapping into shared desires.

 

- Influence requires understanding others’ core desires and appeals, not outsmarting them. 

-Gentle, genuine communication is most persuasive. Forceful tactics often backfire.

-Dialogue is more persuasive than monologue. It allows you to understand others’ needs and build trust. Monologue is self-centered and can seem manipulative.

-Many companies fail at change and influence because they focus on surface-level communication rather than connecting with people’s deeper motivations. Lasting change starts at the individual spiritual level.

-A story illustrates how a government official gained influence by connecting with his employees’ desire for purpose through sincere actions, not just speeches. His “retail” approach to education revived their passion.

-In today’s fast-paced digital world, it’s easy to rely on one-way communication and lose sight of understanding others’ perspectives. But influence requires uncovering others’ core desires through genuine two-way dialogue.

-The overall message is that we must look beyond our self-interest and broadcasting our own perspectives if we want to motivate and persuade others in a mutually beneficial way. We must discover what others truly want and need.

 

The key ideas in the passage are:

1. Influence requires more than frequency and originality. It requires connection and collaboration. 
2. Social media allows us to gain insight into others' interests and values. This knowledge is useful for influence.
3. The most effective way to make a lasting impression on others is to show genuine interest in them and their interests. 
4. Self-interest is part of human nature, but most people take it too far and become self-centered. Focusing on others' interests sets you apart.
5. Showing interest in others' interests does not require denying your own interests. You can incorporate others' interests into your own, which also helps meet your own interests. 
6. Author Anne Rice provides an example of harnessing others' interests. Part of her success came from engaging deeply with her readers about their interests in her vampire books.

In summary, the key to influence and making a lasting impression is moving beyond a self-centered approach and showing real interest in learning about others, their perspectives and their interests. Gaining knowledge about others through social media and engagement can be leveraged for influence, but only if used to establish genuine connection and collaboration. A selfless self-interest that incorporates the interests of others is the most compelling approach.

 Here's a summary:

- Anne Rice has always been genuinely interested in her readers. She personally responds to all of their letters and emails. At one point, she employed three full-time staff to handle the volume of correspondence. Her interest in connecting with readers is authentic and not motivated by increasing book sales. 

- Rice has started using Facebook and Twitter to have more direct conversations with her fans. She appreciates the online community that has formed around her work.

- Showing interest in others is key for business success, not just for authors and public figures. Steve Beecham failed in two previous businesses before succeeding as a mortgage broker. He realized he needed to focus on building relationships, not just getting business. After having a memorable encounter with a kind celebrity, Beecham committed to getting to know new people and looking for ways to help them. His mortgage business became very successful through word-of-mouth referrals. 

- Today, there are many opportunities to show interest in others through social media and online research. Spending just a few minutes a day learning about friends, clients, and employees can lead to new connections, appreciation, collaboration, and business opportunities. 

- People tend to dislike what they don't understand. Showing genuine interest in others leads to connection, relationships, affinity, influence, and conversion. The potential to build meaningful relationships at scale exists today.

- Successful people and businesses recognize that people prefer to interact with those who show interest in them. While some argue that there is a "me" focus today, there are many chances to connect with and learn about others. Making the effort to relate to friends, colleagues, and customers in an authentic way leads to real relationships and mutually beneficial partnerships.

 

• According to surveys, 16% of Americans believe explosives brought down the World Trade Center towers on 9/11, not the burning passenger jets. About half of Europeans believe in God. But 99.7% of adults agree that a smile is socially important. 

• Smiling is innate and crucial for bonding. Studies show smiling has benefits like making people seem more friendly and lenient. Happiness and smiling also spread through social networks, with each happy friend increasing your chance of being happy by 9%. 

• A study of 1,700 college students on Facebook found that people who smile in photos tend to have more friends and be more central in social networks. Smiling makes others feel happy to interact with you. Though digital communication is common now, smiles still spread happiness effectively.

• Emoticons and emojis aim to convey emotion in texts and emails, but smiling through your written words, tone, and language choices is the most effective way to seem friendly and build influence across digital media. Conveying a positive tone and emotion makes others more receptive to your message. While more serious messages require different tones, begin and end positively.

• In summary, smiling has significant social benefits and influence. It spreads through social networks, puts others at ease, builds bonds, and makes you seem more approachable and likeable. Using a positive, friendly tone in written communication can achieve similar effects. A smile, whether in person or conveyed through words, is a powerful way to connect with others in an increasingly digital world.

 Here is a summary of the passage in a positive tone:

The digital age has enhanced the power and significance of a person’s name. Names today represent  one’s identity, character, values and destiny more than ever before. A name is a symbol for who we are and what we stand for. The hundreds of millions of people active on social media want their voices and names to be heard and known. Platforms like Twitter and Facebook have created a new name-based economy where one’s name and brand can be monetized. The more followers one has, the more lucrative business opportunities arise. 

Law firms, in particular, recognize the importance of names. The recent appointment of Kathleen Sullivan as the first female named partner at a top American law firm, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, illustrates this. Being made a named partner is a rare and momentous occasion, especially at a prestigious firm. For Sullivan, it represented the pinnacle of her career and the breaking down of barriers that had excluded women for over a century. The firm's founder acknowledged that including her name in the firm's title demonstrated the integration of their practices and strengths.

Overall, names today signify more than just a word. They represent who we are - our personality, values and potential. As such, they should not be underestimated in their power and influence. A positive and inspiring name can open up opportunities, while a negative one may limit them. Just like a smile, a name is a gift that costs nothing but gives much.

 

Ree Drummond and Dave Munson are examples of people who have built successful personal brands by valuing relationships over transactions. Drummond turned an unexpected life on an Oklahoma cattle ranch into a popular blog and media empire by sharing personal stories. Munson built a multimillion-dollar leather goods company by traveling frequently to Mexico to build relationships with the craftsmen who make his products. 

Remembering and using people’s names is a key part of building good relationships and personal branding. It is a “petty sacrifice” that shows you value the other person. Techniques like visualizing a person’s face when you say their name, repeating their name during conversation, writing it down and concentrating on it can help make names more memorable.

In today’s distracted world, remembering names is challenging but also provides a key advantage. Using someone’s correct name and context in communication is a subtle compliment that makes a good first impression. Defaulting to casual or impersonal greetings like “Hey” or “Hi” is less meaningful. Do some homework to determine how someone refers to themselves before using a more casual nickname. 

While referring to someone as “sir” or “ma’am” is polite, using their actual name, when appropriate, provides an even more personal touch. A person’s own name is the most interesting thing to them, so remembering and using it properly pays dividends in relationships. Forgetting or misusing someone’s name, on the other hand, puts you at a disadvantage. Overall, valuing relationships over transactions and remembering personal details about others leads to better connections and personal success.

 

The key message is that taking the time to listen to others and use their name can make a significant positive impression. Listening shows you value the other person and what they have to say. Using someone's name also makes them feel seen and recognized. These small gestures can help you build rapport and trust, set you apart, and strengthen your connections and influence. 

Several examples are given to illustrate this:

- A waiter named James made a strong impression on a frequent diner simply by remembering and using his name. The diner said he barely remembers most waiters' names. Using someone's name triggers positive emotions and connections. 

- Doctors debate whether using patients' first names helps build rapport or is too informal. One oncologist, Dr. Howard Fine, uses first names to establish trust and give patients hope. His approach is cited as key to his program's success.

- The band Sons of Maxwell wrote a song called "United Breaks Guitars" after a poor customer experience with United Airlines that resulted in a broken guitar. When United failed to listen to their complaints, the band turned to YouTube. The video went viral and cost United $180 million in stock value. Listening is key to customer satisfaction and brand reputation. 

- Online advertising is less effective than "long-term engagement programs" that listen to customers and build trust over time, according to one expert. Simply generating impressions is not enough. 

- Two examples show how important listening was to Abraham Lincoln and Calvin Coolidge's effectiveness and decision making. Listening helped clarify Lincoln's thinking and allowed Coolidge to finish work early while others worked late into the evening.

- Sigmund Freud was described as an exceptionally good listener. Listening well makes an impression and builds connections.

In summary, listening to others and using their names are simple but powerful ways to positively impact your relationships and influence.  They demonstrate you value others and help to build trust, rapport, and loyalty over time.

 

The key ideas in the passage are:

1. Listening and focus are increasingly rare today due to distraction and busyness. People report having fewer close confidants and meaningful interactions.

2. Developing the ability to listen fully and be fully present with others is key to building connection and influence. Asking good questions and discussing what matters to others is key.

3. Most communication today is aimed at educating others about ourselves or selling them something. This is passive and ineffective. We need more dialogue focused on the other person. 

4. Customer Relationship Management should focus on the customer, not just management. Community building starts with identifying what matters to your customers and focusing on meeting their needs.

5. True influence comes from serving the needs and interests of your community. It's not about you or becoming popular. Focus on your customers and community.

6. Making assumptions about others and trying to impress them with yourself often backfires. Discuss what really matters to them.

7. Build a community by starting interactions focused on the needs and interests of others. Connection and shared interests, not just initial impressions, build influence.

So in summary, the key to building connection and influence today is developing the ability to listen well, be fully present, ask good questions, and make the conversation about what matters to the other people - whether customers, colleagues, or communities. This builds trust, meets real needs, and develops shared interests that bond people together.

 

The key to building influence and trusted relationships is moving people from simply being curious followers to committed friends. This means engaging with them in an authentic, meaningful way by conveying value, listening to their concerns, and focusing on what matters to them. 

Mere impressions and connections are not enough. You must nurture relationships, serve others, and make a lasting positive impression. This kind of meaningful engagement leads to true influence and loyalty.

The number of followers you have is less important than who those followers are and your commitment to them. You cannot have hundreds of close friends due to human limitations, but you can have a wider circle of influential relationships by taking the risk to invest in others. Make sure you know what matters to those who matter to you.

Leading a meaningful dialogue and building community is about more than gaining fans or customers. It is about establishing trust, conveying value, and leaving others better as a result of your interaction and leadership. True success comes from committing to engage with and serve people in an authentic way over the long run.

In summary, lasting influence comes from building trust-based relationships, not just racking up followers and fans. Establish a meaningful dialogue, focus on conveying value, listen to understand others, commit to engage and serve authentically, leave others better, and nurture relationships with those who matter most. That is the path to true influence and community.

 Here is a summary of the passage:

- The story begins with a man named Scanlon losing his phone in a cab during a visit to Little Italy in New York City. Fortunately, the cab driver, named Mike, returns the phone after Scanlon calls his own number. Scanlon is grateful for Mike’s kindness and gives him a generous tip. 

- Scanlon says Mike demonstrated “small-picture thinking” by going out of his way to help a customer in need. While “big-picture thinking”—setting ambitious goals and making big deals—has its benefits, focusing too much on the big picture can cause us to miss opportunities to make a meaningful impact through small acts of service. 

- For example, a sales manager set an ambitious goal to double women’s shoe sales but ended up decreasing sales because he focused too much on big sales and upselling customers. When he set the same goal a few months later but focused on providing great customer service in small ways, sales increased by 40 percent. The big picture was the same, but changing focus to small details made the difference. 

- Inspiration alone does not lead to results. Just as art students need instruction in the details to become master artists, we need to focus on the small, meaningful acts that bring a vision to life. Grand intentions in relationships and business partnerships fall short without follow-through in small ways. 

- Leonardo da Vinci’s famous painting of the Mona Lisa is used as an example. The masterpiece took 16 years to complete, but what brought it such acclaim was the intricate detail of her enigmatic smile. Without that memorable detail, it would just be another painting. In the same way, the small acts of service and value are what set our biggest endeavors apart and help them reach their full potential.

- To win friends and influence people today, we must move from manipulative marketing tactics to adding real meaning and value. While infamy and provocation are easy ways to get attention, they do not build deep, lasting relationships. Consistently adding value through meaningful interactions is the only way to motivate genuine collaboration, connection, and loyalty from others in the crowded digital age. The secret to progress in any relationship is making a meaningful impact through small details.

 

The key message is that avoiding arguments and confrontation is the best way to build trust and productive relationships. The examples of Billy Graham and Tony Hayward illustrate this well.

- Billy Graham won over his harshest critic, a columnist named William Connor, by inviting him to meet in person. Rather than argue or fight back, Graham disarmed Connor with friendliness and sincerity. Connor went from scornful critic to admirer. 

- Arguing with someone rarely changes their mind and usually just entrenches them further in their position. It's futile whether you're right or wrong. Dave Barry illustrates this with his quip about how he can win any argument but has few remaining friends as a result.

- So much interaction online involves pointless arguments and attacks. Comments sections are filled with arguments and insults, and media examples abound. These arguments rarely persuade and mostly just provoke. 

- Tony Hayward, the former BP CEO, took a combative stance after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. He denied evidence, downplayed the scale of the disaster, made insensitive comments, and avoided taking responsibility. His actions destroyed trust and highlighted how ineffective argument and deflection are. 

- The key lesson is that avoiding confrontation and argument, employing sincerity and empathy instead, is the path to building trust and goodwill. Persuasion comes through example, not attack. Leaving others better, not proving a point, is the goal.

So in summary, the scale should tip toward building value and trust in each encounter by avoiding arguments, taking the high road, and seeking to understand rather than attack. Over time, consistently avoiding confrontation and employing goodwill is the surest path to maintaining trust and cultivating strong, mutually beneficial relationships.

 

- Tony Hayward, the CEO of BP, lost credibility and public support due to his poor response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. His argumentative approach caused people to distrus both him and BP, leading to boycotts and damaged reputation.

- Conflict and tension often arise because people fail to recognize that others may have valuable insights. The best solutions come from listening to multiple perspectives, not just one's own. 

- Saying "you're wrong" is the surest way to end collaboration and damage relationships. Even when you disagree, it's better to acknowledge the other side's legitimate concerns. Subtle differences in opinion are more common than outright opposition.

- Friendship requires accepting honest differences of opinion. Disagreement is often just a small crack, not an unbridgeable chasm. 

- People enter conversations thinking they know something or should know something. This closes their minds to other perspectives. Effective problem-solving requires an open, humble approach where you acknowledge you may not have all the facts and may not be completely right. 

- Listening with an open mind allows for collaborative solutions that combine insights to become more than the sum of their parts. This "melting of thoughts" is more productive than rigidly promoting one's own agenda.

- The Brazilian president Lula provided an example of a negotiator who achieved great success by avoiding confrontation and building alliances. Despite leading a new socialist party, he worked with both left-wing groups and wealthy conservatives. His approach of tolerance, negotiation, and interdependence allowed him to enact social reforms and economic growth.

The key lessons are: value interdependence over independence; understand that perception is reality; avoid arguments by acknowledging multiple perspectives; build alliances through negotiation and finding common ground. Compromise and considering the legitimate concerns of others leads to better outcomes than an insistence on getting one's way.

 Here's a summary:

People are often reluctant to admit they are wrong. This is because we value being personally right over collaborating with others. By insisting on being right, we damage relationships and miss opportunities for progress. 

Jeles, a mediator, shares an example of facilitating a meeting between bickering media executives after Hurricane Katrina. Rather than argue over who was right, she asked each group to consider how they could have better supported the others. This led to collaboration and solutions.

Francis Collins, head of the Human Genome Project, had to work with Craig Venter, who wanted to complete the project first. Despite their different personalities and goals, Collins chose to cooperate rather than insist Venter was wrong. He saw their differences as an opportunity for progress.

Dale Carnegie almost told a man he was wrong for attributing a quote to the Bible instead of Shakespeare. But his friend stopped him, saying there was no need to prove the man wrong and damage his pride in that social situation. Carnegie learned it's best to avoid telling people they are wrong, since it usually makes them emotional and defensive rather than open to logic.

It's easy in online communication to imply someone is wrong with our tone. But we should be careful with our words since each one lacks the nuance of expression and voice. It's better to avoid an accusatory tone and seek to collaborate.

 

• Settling disputes in person allows for a more respectful, conciliatory 
environment. Offer your point with an open mind. Default to diplomacy, 
admit you may be wrong, concede the other person may be right. See the
other's perspective and show respect. This approach leads to good results.

• Admit faults quickly and emphatically. Referees and public figures often refuse 
to admit mistakes, leading to lingering frustration. Admitting errors redeems 
the situation. For example, umpire Jim Joyce immediately apologized to pitcher 
Armando Galarraga for mistakenly calling a runner safe, ruining Galarraga's 
perfect game. His apology redeemed the situation.

• We all make mistakes but have a hard time admitting them. For example, Tiger 
Woods' vague admission of "transgressions" caused more damage than a quick, 
sincere apology would have. A prompt apology confirms you care about those hurt,
are humbled, and want to make things right. People forgive those who admit faults 
quickly. For example, the public forgave Jason Giambi for admitting steroid use, 
but not Mark McGwire for delaying admission.

• Admitting faults quickly issues a press release saying you care, are humbled, and 
want to make amends. If aloof about mistakes, you imply wanting your old life back, 
which only you can restore. Admitting mistakes satisfies and solves problems. Ronald 
Reagan moved from weakness to strength with quips like admitting his administration's 
"right hand doesn't know what our far right hand is doing."

 Here's a summary:

It is always better to admit your mistakes quickly and take responsibility for your actions. When we do so, others are more likely to forgive us and the mistake seems less serious. If we refuse to admit error or delay in doing so, it angers others and makes the mistake appear worse. Today with social media, we have more opportunity to publicly apologize and contain negative reactions.

It takes courage to admit mistakes both publicly and privately. But choosing humility and seeking forgiveness allows us to accept our imperfections. The story illustrates this through Anne, a successful executive who had an affair and hid it for six years before telling her husband. Although it was painful, her admission and his forgiveness allowed them both to gain a healthier perspective where she didn't have to be perfect. Admitting mistakes, although difficult, can be liberating. 

The example of the baseball umpire and pitcher shows the power of sincerely apologizing. Even though the umpire cost the pitcher a perfect game, the pitcher forgave him, and they were able to reconcile. Their behavior demonstrated remarkable sportsmanship and inspired others.

Leaders especially need to be willing to admit errors and begin interactions in a friendly, humble way. The story of the young pastor meeting with the influential lay leader illustrates this. Although the lay leader had caused problems in the past, the pastor approached him with friendliness and respect. He acknowledged the man's influence and asked to work together. This friendly approach led the man to become an ally.

The example of Sheriff Dick Kienast shows the power of a friendly approach. He believed that civility and compassion should govern all interactions. One of his deputies, Bob Braudis, demonstrated this with a hostage situation at a local restaurant. Although the gunman was agitated over not seeing his daughter, Braudis peacefully approached and spoke with him. His friendly demeanor helped defuse the situation.

In summary, admitting mistakes and using a friendly approach, especially with difficult people or situations, can have a powerful impact. It allows for reconciliation and turning enemies into allies. Although hard, choosing humility and compassion over defensiveness and aggression leads to healthier relationships and perspectives.

 

Bob was able to defuse a tense and dangerous situation through courteous and empathetic communication. His calm, friendly demeanor allowed the armed suspect to feel heard and understood. By validating the man's feelings without judgment, Bob built rapport and trust. The suspect eventually put down his weapon and surrendered willingly. 

This story illustrates the power of a courteous and empathetic approach, especially in tense situations. When communicating with someone with whom you disagree or who has frustrated you, leading with a friendly tone can yield better results. Taking time to show interest in the other person by inquiring about their life or sharing information about yourself helps to build connection and rapport. While modern communication methods like texting often lack the nuance to convey friendliness, making the effort to do so when possible leads to better understanding and cooperation.

Business leaders today need to adopt an "old-fashioned" approach to customer service that shows authentic care, concern and friendliness. Responses and reactions alone should not be used to gauge the effectiveness of outreach or connection. Engagement that leads to lasting relationships is built on mutual benefit and trust, not just interest or entertainment. Leading with courtesy and friendliness, as the fable of the sun and wind illustrates, is more effective than aggression or force. For engagement to be meaningful, it must be genuine. Affinity that exists before direct contact can provide an opportunity to build connection, but relationship requires real effort. Like attracts like, so to gain influence with others, focus on nurturing affinity and leading with a friendly approach.

 

The key message is that starting from a place of agreement and positivity leads to better outcomes in conversations and relationships. This is known as “getting to yes.” Establishing common ground and affinity early on creates opportunities for influence and success.

Microsoft employed this strategy successfully when launching Windows 7 after the poorly received Vista release. They identified fans and influencers, solicited their feedback, and made them feel like co-creators. This got people saying “yes” to Windows 7 from the start. 

In contrast, many companies do the opposite - they bombard people with their message without considering the audience’s interests or needs. This results in people saying “stop” rather than “yes.” Effective communication should be like a “snowfall” of many light touches, not a “blizzard” of business. Success comes from offering people what they want, not what you want to tell them.

There are two types of agreement: (1) sharing the same opinion after a dialogue and (2) liking the same thing and being similar. The latter type of affinity-based agreement has become more important, and it is a new form of “yes.” Gaining this common ground and early affinity leads to more success.

Finally, sharing credit and success is key. Taking all the credit and glory for yourself while blaming others when things go wrong is the worst quality in a leader. People do not want self-centered friends or leaders. Sharing credit multiplies success and influence, but it requires a genuine attitude of gratitude. Fear often prevents us from giving others their due, but we should fear becoming someone who cannot share success more.

 

The key message is that by surrendering credit and praise to others, you gain much more in return. When you are generous in sharing success and spotlight with people around you, they will reciprocate that generosity. They will want you to succeed and be happy. This creates a virtuous cycle of collaboration, gratitude and mutual support.

Some examples that illustrate this principle:

- The Dead Sea vs the Sea of Galilee. The Dead Sea keeps all the water for itself and is devoid of life. The Sea of Galilee gives its water away and is full of life. Likewise, when we hoard success and credit, we become like the Dead Sea. But when we share it with others, we gain life and vitality. 

- Long Oscar acceptance speeches where the winners thank many people. This shows their gratitude and willingness to share the spotlight. The most nominated actresses like Greer Garson and Bette Davis were known for such speeches.

- Mark Twain surrendering credit for a story to Henry Irving. Twain didn't care who got credit, as long as the conversation went well. 

- Ronald Reagan's leadership philosophy centered around uplifting Americans and the country. He didn't care much for his own legacy and credit. He lived to serve others.

- Armando Galarraga showing empathy and compassion for the umpire who ruined his perfect game. Rather than berating the umpire, Galarraga hugged him and said "nobody's perfect". His grace and empathy in the face of disappointment and injustice won more accolades than a perfect game would have.

In summary, surrendering credit and engaging with empathy are hallmarks of influential leadership and personal success. When we elevate others, we ourselves become elevated.

 

- Achieving empathy, according to S. Nirenberg, happens when we consider other people's ideas and 
feelings as important as our own. 

- It is easy to criticize leaders from a distance, but we rarely appreciate the immense pressure and 
responsibility they face. By putting ourselves in their position, we can become sympathetic to them.

- A story illustrates how a nurse's empathy and kindness profoundly impacted a young boy's life. She 
understood his loneliness and made him feel better.

- We must work to develop empathy since we are not naturally empathetic. Our backgrounds and 
experiences influence how we respond to others. By understanding what moves us personally, we can 
connect better with others. 

- Empathy is not a tactic but a way to gain influence in relationships. An example is the baseball player 
who graciously forgave an umpire's mistake. 

- Appealing to people's noble motives, like respect for motherhood or children, can influence them. It 
assigns them a sense of nobility and conveys belief in them.

- A story shows how appealing to a company's noble motives and credibility resolved a price issue. 
Calm, honest communication and citing the initial agreement led to an apology and solution.

- We all have a desire for purpose and meaning, to be part of something greater. Stories and movies tap 
into this. If we allow others to prove their nobility, it increases their self-worth and our influence.

- Advertisers and nonprofits often appeal to our noble desires to influence us. People usually respond well 
when they feel others see them as honest, unselfish and fair.

- A story tells of learning a restaurant used slave labor. The desire to do the right, moral thing led to 
starting a movement against human trafficking. Appealing to people's nobility gained influence.

 

- The story of a restaurant that forced illegal immigrant employees to work under harsh conditions ignited David's passion to start the Not for Sale Campaign. The campaign seeks to expose modern-day slavery. 
- The campaign rolled out an app called Free2Work that grades companies on how well they prevent forced labor and protect workers. The app provides accountability for companies and responsibility for consumers. 
- Appealing to people's noble motives can incite positive change. Amy Martin's response to help during the 2011 Japan tsunami shows how appealing to humanity can be powerful. While helping, she saw news channels focused more on ratings and celebrities than saving lives, which she criticized. 
- Connecting with people means celebrating their dignity. Appealing to noble motives can move people and inspire change.
- The cotton industry rebranded cotton in the 1970s with the slogan "The fabric of our lives" and by having celebrities promote cotton. They wove cotton into people's personal stories to make it desirable again. 
- People don't want to be treated as commodities. They want to feel like they matter and be part of a bigger story. Companies like Apple and TOMS Shoes have succeeded by allowing people to connect with a larger story.
- TOMS Shoes was started to give shoes to children in need. For every pair bought, a pair is donated. The company is now a one-for-one company, not just a shoe company. TOMS' story and mission inspire advocacy and marketing. 
- While big stories can attract interest, personal stories can be intimidating to share. But sharing your story allows you to build trust and connection.

 

- David Kuo woke up in the ER and was told he had a brain tumor likely to kill him within months. At first, he and his wife wanted to keep it private. But they decided to share the news with friends and family, who told others. They set up a page to share updates and get support. 
- Sharing their story ended up helping others in similar situations. Their advice is for everyone to share their story. A woman with breast cancer found that sharing her diagnosis led to an outpouring of support from others. 
- Sharing your story, especially in the digital age, helps build relationships by creating common ground and giving people an authentic view into your life. New tools like livestreaming, video conferencing, and dynamic websites make it easy to share in more compelling ways. Doing something unique beyond just technology can make ideas vivid and dramatic. 
- Competition, like between Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, brings out the best in people and pushes them to strive. Though they didn't like each other at first, they came to respect each other and drove the other to improve. A challenge doesn't have to be antagonistic; even a lighthearted one like Coke's challenge not to smile in their ad campaign brought people together. Competition between Microsoft and AOL also drove innovation that benefited customers. 
- How one responds to challenges, whether injuries, illness or setbacks, determines their fate. Teddy Roosevelt overcame lifelong asthma and a weak heart by taking up his father's challenge to build up his body. Through rigorous exercise, he strengthened himself physically and mentally, developing a boldness and love of nature. He went on to live a vigorous life, becoming the 26th US president.

 Here's a summary of the passage:

- Begin conversations on a positive note. Starting with criticism or negative feedback puts people on the defensive and makes them resistant to your message. 

- Our brains are wired to focus on threats and negative events. We have a tendency to weigh negative traits and behaviors more heavily, especially when we're frustrated with someone. This shapes our perception of reality.

- When we lead with criticism, the negative aspects of our message become the focus and drown out any positive parts. People become closed off, anxious, and unlikely to listen. 

- Research shows that negative feedback hampers performance and attitudes. People may dismiss critical feedback outright. Praising people first leads to better outcomes.

- We can overcome these tendencies by acknowledging them, analyzing our assumptions, and focusing on the positives. Look for the fuller, more balanced reality. Train yourself to recognize others' perspectives and intentions.

- Two examples: A coach praised his team after a loss before practicing free throws. An army officer corrected a soldier's behavior without belittling him, making him a better person.

- The key message is: start crucial conversations on a positive note. Lead with praise and appreciation. This will make people more open to your ideas and less defensive. Define reality in a balanced, compassionate way.

 

To effectively show appreciation and provide constructive feedback, leaders should:

- Predict what those they coach might do next, focusing on positive behaviors. This allows for authentic appreciation. 
- Find a truthful, positive starting point and show appreciation that resonates. The best leaders take the time to understand how each team member thinks and acts.
- Acknowledge the value a person provides to establish open communication. Address issues directly instead of avoiding them. 
- Lead with the positive and avoid drama. Criticize sparingly, following a "three-for-one rule" of finding three good things for each criticism.
- Have genuine, heartfelt praise and a smooth flow from positive to constructive. Offer advice, not just criticism. In writing, use "and" instead of "but" in transitions.
- Admit their own mistakes and baggage first. This helps others become receptive and builds trust. Admitting fault is key to learning and advancement. 
- Share stories of their own mistakes to show their humanity and help others relate. Follow stories with advice, not just criticism.
- Consider the other's lack of experience and their own mistakes at that level. Say, "You made a mistake, but I've made many. Judgment comes with experience." Admitting your own mistakes deflects attention from the other's and softens the approach.

 

President Calvin Coolidge demonstrates quiet leadership by discreetly and tactfully handling a cat burglar who broke into the Willard Hotel during Coolidge’s first days in office. Rather than punishing or condemning the young burglar, Coolidge has a quiet conversation with him, finds out the context for his actions, loans him money, and allows him to leave without facing legal consequences. This approach builds confidence and connection rather than diminishing the burglar. 

Leaders can influence behavior in subtle ways, such as:

- Modeling the behavior themselves. People tend to do what they see their leaders doing. 
- Identifying and influencing those who have sway over others. Getting influential people to model the target behavior.
- Framing the behavior as benefiting the greater good. Appealing to peer pressure. 
- Making the environment conducive to the target behavior. Removing obstacles and making the behavior easy to do.

An example is solving conflict between cooks and waitresses after WWII by implementing a simple communication system (the metal spindle) that improved efficiency, reduced conflict, and built cooperation.

Rather than scolding the mechanic who fueled his plane incorrectly, test pilot Bob Hoover gave him another opportunity to prove himself. This quiet, confident approach built the mechanic's confidence and ensured he would never make the same mistake again. Leaders should see mistakes as isolated instances rather than condemnation-worthy flaws. It is best to address mistakes honestly but pull people out of despair quickly.

Captain D. Michael Abrashoff turned around low morale on the USS Benfold by listening to his crew through one-on-one interviews. Rather than barking orders, he identified problems (like too much time spent on chores) and empowered the crew to find solutions. His approach built trust and confidence, turning around the ship's performance. Asking questions and listening is often more effective than direct orders.

 

- The captain of the USS Benfold, Captain Abrashoff, asked questions of his crew to improve morale and performance. He found many came from difficult backgrounds but were devoted to their families. He included family members in the sailors' lives to help motivate them. By linking the crew's goals to improving the ship, their performance and test scores improved dramatically. 

- Simply issuing orders likely would not have produced the same results. Asking questions makes orders more palatable, reduces resentment, stimulates creativity, and makes people more willing to follow. People don't like being ordered around. 

- Leaders are reluctant to ask questions because they don't know what responses they'll get and fear losing control. But the answers may be better than what the leader envisioned. The leader of a manufacturing plant asked his employees for ideas to complete an order on time. They came up with solutions and insisted he take the order, which they completed on time.

- Asking employees questions before a performance review allows them to assess themselves. Studies show self-appraisals lead to more satisfying reviews and improved performance. Leaders can ask questions to start a useful conversation in any medium. 

- Fault can be mitigated or avoided by saving face. Winston Churchill allowed a shy war hero to save face, moving him from feeling like a "miserable fool" to the "hero he was." Failure is inevitable, but insensitive behavior by leaders instills fear of failure in others. A media company executive failed to launch a new magazine but the CEO congratulated her, allowing her to save face. He followed the "forgive and remember" technique to help people learn from failure. Great leaders help others save face so they can tap into their creativity.

 

- A study looked at 688 employees during the rollout of a new data system.
- Employees who were told mistakes were okay and not punished experimented more with the system. 
- Those in departments where mistakes were punished experimented less, especially lower-status employees.
- The employees who experimented the most became the most proficient with the system.
- This shows the importance of developing resilience - the ability to bounce back from failure. 
- Companies that recruit from the military value resilience since they are used to dealing with frequent failures. 
- To build resilience, leaders should:

1. Acknowledge that failure happens 
2. Encourage dialogue to build trust
3. Separate the person from the failure 
4. Learn from mistakes
5. Create a system to approach risk and failure

- Helping others save face builds trust and confidence. It's important in an age where failures are so public. 
- You can help others save face by:

1. Gently acknowledging a mistake 
2. Recognizing your own role 
3. Focusing on what was gained
4. Addressing the issue broadly without blaming others

- It's also important to be careful with written communication since emails can be accidentally sent or hacked, embarrassing someone.
- Helping customers save face can be a good business tactic. A company gave free products to customers who complained about the wrong product, building goodwill.
- Saving face builds trust and influence. Magnifying others' improvements and successes is also important for building morale and relationships.

 

- Wallace Pope is an employee at the Best Western River North Hotel in Chicago. 
- He provides exceptional customer service and brightens visitors’ days. 
- The hotel created a Facebook page titled “Wallace Should Win” to show support for him when he was nominated for an award. Visitors shared many stories praising Wallace for his kindness, helpfulness, and ability to make them feel welcome.
- While Wallace did not win the award, the praise and encouragement meant a lot to him.
- Praise and encouragement are key to motivating people, yet managers and leaders often fail to provide enough of either. 
- Surveys show most employees rarely receive praise, written thanks, or public recognition from their managers, even though these are highly motivating. 
- Praise should be sincere, specific, and delivered as quickly as possible. Publicly praising someone is also very meaningful.
- Encouragement shows faith in someone and their abilities. It fosters resilience and motivation. 
- Key practices for creating an encouraging environment include:

1. Make healthy relationships a priority through respect and communication.
2. Practice daily encouragement. Recognize all efforts and progress.  
3. Be inclusive by involving others in decision making. 
4. Address conflicts openly and constructively. Avoid discouraging language.
5. Have fun together.

- An example shows how encouragement and minimizing a student's faults helped transform his self-belief and abilities. With patience and praise for each small success, the student progressed rapidly in math and reading.

 

The story describes a father helping his son, David, improve at quickly memorizing a deck of cards. At first, it took David 52 minutes to get through the deck with no mistakes. His father promised that once David could do it in under 8 minutes, they would stop the practice. 

Through encouragement and celebration of David's improvements, he steadily got faster. Within a month, David could go through the cards perfectly in under 8 minutes. This achievement and his father's faith in him led to a transformation. David went from struggling in school to being on the honor roll and enjoying learning. He discovered new talents and won awards for a science project.

The key messages from the story are:

1. Expressing total faith in someone's ability to achieve a goal and encouraging their efforts can motivate them to accomplish amazing things. Provide positive feedback and highlight their strengths and skills. 

2. Giving someone a reputation to live up to, with high expectations of their character and abilities, can inspire them to fulfill that vision. They will often live up to what is expected of them.

3. Finding common ground and shared interests can help to overcome tensions and divisions between groups. Recognizing their shared goals and priorities can build bridges.

So in summary, the three techniques for motivating and influencing others that can be taken from this story are:

1. Offer encouragement and highlight abilities

2. Give a reputation to live up to 

3. Connect over common ground

 

- To influence someone's attitude or behavior, you need to overcome any resistance by making them feel good about doing what you want. This is not manipulation - it's finding a win-win by connecting your goals to their goals. 

- It's easy today to find connections with others if you take the time. Do research on people and companies to find shared visions and goals. Ask people about their lives to find common interests. We're only "one degree" from being able to influence anyone.

- A student wrote famous people and received letters back from the German president and Dalai Lama. By making an effort to reach out, people will share their stories and motivations.

- Dana White, UFC president, accidentally tweeted his phone number but spent 90 minutes talking to fans. He learned the value of connecting with fans. Now he has a fan phone line and talks with them regularly. His transparency and openness built the sport.

- Many executives fail because they are arrogant and dismissive of others. Humility and valuing others are key to leadership. Yvon Chouinard of Patagonia creates an "egalitarian atmosphere" with open offices and independent workers.

- A company helped reduce turnover by providing shuttle service for employees after finding transportation was their biggest struggle. They then asked about employees' dreams and helped them achieve those. Knowing people's motivations and goals allows you to connect your desired outcomes to their goals.

- To influence others:
1. Be sincere 
2. Be empathetic - understand their wants
3. Consider the benefits to them
4. Match benefits to their wants
5. Request in a way that shows personal benefit

- Staying connected with customers digitally is key today. Social media should be central to a company's strategy. The key is using them for ongoing communication, not just transactions. We now expect constant company-customer contact.

- "The rise of social media," says Branson, the influential British business leader, "means the idea of companies and customers being instantly and constantly in touch is not an exception; it's the expectation."

 

The growth of social media and digital communication tools 

presented exciting challenges and caused companies to question their usual ways of doing business. To succeed, social media efforts must be supported from the top leadership. David Cush, CEO of Virgin America, gave broad guidelines to his young social media team and then gave them freedom.

Virgin America’s social media team used Facebook and Twitter as part of the company’s communication strategy. This allowed for a marketing campaign where Virgin flew Chihuahuas from overcrowded shelters in San Francisco to New York. Virgin promoted this story through social media, and it went viral, gaining media attention and leading to a successful sale.

The traditional roles of advertising, marketing, and customer relations have changed. Leaders must now win friends and influence people in an authentic, positive way. Success today requires connectivity and interaction. Physical proximity is less important than relational proximity. Though people can occasionally stay productive remotely, influential leadership requires relational proximity through frequent communication.

The keys to winning friends and influencing people today are connecting and staying connected on common ground. The world may be open for business, but business success still depends on humanity. Endeavors require interdependence and interaction.

In summary, the growth of digital communication has presented challenges but also opportunities. Success requires support from leadership, an ability to question conventions, connectivity, interaction, and a focus on relationships and common interests. The core principles of winning friends and influencing people still apply but must be achieved through a digital landscape and frequent, open communication.

- The article discusses TOMS Shoes, a company that practices a “one for one” business model. For every pair of shoes TOMS sells, it donates a pair of shoes to a child in need. 
- TOMS was founded by Blake Mycoskie after he visited Argentina and saw many children without shoes. He sought to help provide shoes to children in need around the world. 
- TOMS model of giving has inspired other similar brands like Warby Parker, which donates a pair of glasses for every pair sold. The one for one model is an innovative form of social entrepreneurship.
- However, some critics argue the model can be unsustainable or can negatively impact local economies and shoe industries. Supporters counter that it raises awareness, helps those in need, and inspires customers. 
- TOMS now donates shoes in over 60 countries and has expanded to also providing clean water, birth kits, and bullying prevention initiatives. The company continues to grow rapidly.
