Foreword by Tony Robbins:

- Invisible forces like radiation, gravity, and electromagnetism profoundly impact life. Human emotions like love, hate, fear, and anger also uniquely and powerfully shape us.
- Energy medicine practitioners help people process trauma and heal. Dr. Brad Nelson has been doing this work for 30 years.
- Brad and Jean Nelson met Tony and Sage Robbins and shared their work helping people clear emotional baggage to heal. The Robbinses experienced the Emotion Code process and found it surprisingly effective and simple. They believe it can help many.

Acknowledgments:

- Dr. Nelson thanks his patients, family, agent, publisher, the Robbinses, and especially his wife Jean for helping create and share the Emotion Code with the world.

The author introduces the concept of trapped emotions - negative emotional energies that have become stuck in the body over time. These trapped emotions can cause many physical and mental problems. Releasing trapped emotions using the Emotion Code method can provide unique and sudden healing and improvements.

The author shares many examples of people finding relief from anxiety, depression, pain, allergies, weight problems, vision problems, and more by releasing their trapped emotions. The book aims to teach readers how to find and free their trapped feelings and help others do the same.

• Emotions are made up of energy and vibration. When we experience an emotion, our body generates an emotional pulse. We then feel the emotion and process it, releasing the energy. If this process is interrupted, the emotional energy can become trapped in the body.

• Trapped emotions consist of energies that have a shape and form. They are not visible but are very real. They can cause physical and emotional stress.

• A teacher named Neil had a trapped emotion of resentment toward his principal that caused him stress, anger, and high blood pressure for years until he released it. Releasing this trapped emotion allowed him to move on from that situation.

• Trapped emotions can hold your present and future hostage and prevent you from living the life you want. They can sabotage relationships and success.

• Jennifer, a college student, had a trapped emotion of creative insecurity that unintentionally caused her to sabotage new relationships. Releasing this trapped emotion allowed her to overcome her fear of commitment and nurture a new relationship.

• Many people fail to reach their full potential because trapped emotions from their past are sabotaging their efforts. Releasing trapped emotions can help people overcome obstacles, improve relationships, feel more motivated and secure, and create the life they want.

• While therapy and discussing the past can be helpful, it does not directly address trapped emotions. Trapped emotions are often the actual root cause of people's problems.

• Releasing trapped emotions allowed Julia, a court reporter, to overcome a learning disability and excel in her career. Her trapped emotions were sabotaging her ability to do well on her job.

The key message is that trapped emotions from your past can sabotage your present and future success and happiness. Releasing these trapped emotions through the Emotion Code allows you to overcome past obstacles, create better relationships, feel more motivated and secure, and build your desired life. This simple process can help anyone transcend their emotional baggage and reach new levels of well-being and prosperity.

Julia wanted to become a court reporter. She took classes to learn how to type very quickly and accurately for the job. However, she struggled during the testing and failed the exam three times. She was worried she would not pass on her next attempt.

When tested, it was found that Julia had trapped discouragement from when she was 15 years old and her parents divorced. This old trapped emotion was sabotaging her during the testing. After releasing this trapped emotion, Julia passed her next exam.

Trapped emotions are invisible energies that can cause physical, emotional and relationship problems. They need to be released to eliminate their damaging effects. Time alone does not release trapped emotions. The longer they remain trapped, the more problems they can cause.

Releasing trapped emotions can significantly improve health, feelings, behavior, and relationships. Several stories were shared of people's conditions improving after trapped emotions were released.

Trapped emotions can be a source of physical pain and health issues, not just emotional pain. The story was shared of Debbie who thought she was having a heart attack, but it was found to be caused by trapped heartache from three years earlier during a painful divorce. Although she had gone through therapy and thought she had dealt with the pain, the trapped emotion still affected her physically.

Releasing trapped emotions allows people to live healthier, happier lives free of their negative impacts. Trapped emotions are not a permanent part of someone - they can be released.

- Sonya went through several traumatic events in a short period: her mother passed away, her son moved out, she accidentally ran over her dog, she had a hysterectomy, and she had a stressful job.

- She started experiencing intense random pains in her legs, arms, and whole body that worsened over time. The pains were debilitating and exhausting.

- She saw many doctors and specialists, but they could not determine the cause of the pains and said they were "weird." Medical tests came back normal.

- She tried various therapies like massage, chiropractic, acupuncture, and physical therapy, but nothing provided relief. She had to take muscle relaxers and pain medication.

- She became depressed from the constant pain and not knowing the cause. Her husband felt helpless.

- She received Reiki training and tried to treat herself but felt unworthy, which did not help.

- She came across the Emotion Code book and method, which aims to release trapped emotions that can cause physical pain and symptoms.

- The trapped emotions of "unworthy" and grief were released from her body, and she found relief from the debilitating pains she had been experiencing for years. Releasing the emotions allowed her body to heal.

- Her story exemplifies how trapped emotions can manifest as physical pain and how releasing them can lead to healing. Her body was trapped in emotional baggage from past events until it was released.

The author had a short attention span for reading but found a book so compelling she could not put it down and finished it quickly. The book was so impactful that she bought the companion materials and began using the Emotion Code technique on herself and others. She found that many of the random physical pains and deep sadness she had been experiencing disappeared. After praying about it and feeling it was truthful, she became certified in the Emotion Code to help others.

Looking back, she realized she had accumulated many trapped emotions from trauma, loss, health issues, and life struggles. Releasing these trapped emotions brought her more peace and purpose. While the Emotion Code is not a cure-all, releasing trapped emotions can help improve health and well-being. The effects can be dramatic or subtle but often bring a sense of increased contentment and calm.

The author explains that trapped emotions are universal and can contribute to nearly any health or emotional issue, from anxiety and back pain to Parkinson's and vertigo. Trapped emotions lower immunity, distort the body's energy, block organ function, and create imbalance. The Emotion Code is a simple and precise way to release trapped emotions, bringing profound healing and relief even when nothing else has helped.

Releasing trapped emotions brought the author a greater connection to herself and others, increased confidence, peace of mind, joy, and ability to deal with challenges. Her health, sleep, and digestion improved. Her negative self-talk, anxiety, and hip pain disappeared. Past traumas no longer bothered her; she felt lighter and more accessible. She felt immense gratitude for the changes.

The author explains that trapped emotions come from complex life events and circumstances that we all experience. The only way to know if you have trapped emotions is to ask your subconscious mind. The conscious mind uses little of the brain's capacity, while the subconscious mind always works, stores information, and regulates the body. Although the subconscious significantly impacts space on our feelings, thoughts, and actions, most people pay little attention to it. The Emotion Code provides a way to communicate with the subconscious to identify and release trapped emotions.

Here's a summary:

• Your subconscious mind performs many critical functions automatically, like controlling your heartbeat, breathing, digestion, etc. It would be tough to handle all these functions consciously.

• Like a computer, your subconscious mind stores vast information, including everything you've ever experienced. It's aware of your body's needs and any trapped emotions.

• Your subconscious mind can be accessed using muscle testing, a form of kinesiology developed in the 1960s. Muscle testing allows healers to get information directly from a patient's subconscious about what they need to heal.

• All organisms, including humans, respond to positive and negative stimuli. Your body will be drawn to positive thoughts or things and repelled by negative ones. This happens on a subconscious level.

• The Sway Test is a superficial muscle testing method you can use alone. It involves making a statement while standing still and relaxed and noticing which direction your body sways - forward for positive/factual ideas, backward for negative/untrue ones.

• For the Sway Test to work, stand with feet shoulder-width apart, hands at sides, close your eyes, relax, and clear your mind. Make a statement and notice which way your body sways within 10 seconds. Don't try to force the movement.

• Keep your mind clear after making the statement so your subconscious can determine how to respond. If your thoughts wander, it will be harder for your subconscious to answer accurately.

• Practice the Sway Test to get better at it. Regular use lets you get accurate information from your subconscious mind.

- Your body will naturally sway forward when presented with a positive or true statement and backward when presented with negative or false information. This is known as the Sway Test.

- It takes practice and patience to get good at the Sway Test. Giving up control and allowing your body to respond intuitively is challenging for some. But with regular exercise, response times will improve.

- Everything in the universe, including our bodies and emotions, is made up of energy. Trapped emotions are made up of points stuck in the body.

- Ancient physicians found correlations between specific emotions and the organs that produce them. For example, the heart and small intestine have feelings related to betrayal and heartache. The liver produces anger. The lungs have grief.

- The Emotion Code uses a chart with 60 emotions to help identify the exact emotional vibration that may be trapped. Even though many nuanced words describe feelings, the chart covers the full range. The subconscious will guide you to the closest match.

- Excessive amounts of emotion can lead to disease in the organ that produces that emotion. This may have been the case with Dana Reeve, who died of lung cancer shortly after her husband, Christopher Reeve, became paralyzed. Her grief likely contributed to or caused a tumor.

- Trapped emotions can lodge anywhere in the body, not just near the organ of origin. Anger from the liver, for example, may end up trapped in the knees or lower back.

- Energy medicine recognizes that the body's flow and energy balance profoundly impact our health. Ancient healing systems from China, India, and other cultures worked with the body's energy. Although invisible, power can be felt and influences us greatly.

- Our belief systems often prevent us from perceiving specific energies and healing modalities. We learn from an early age what can and can't exist based on the physical world we observe. But there are energies, like emotions, that we can't see but can feel and experience.

- What we perceive as solid objects are made up of vibrating energies at the subatomic level. Our senses only allow us to see the surface of things, but everything is energy and space at the microscopic and quantum groups.

- Our thoughts are also made of energy and are not confined within our minds. The power of our thoughts emanates from us and affects those around us, for better or worse.

- We are all connected energetically. What happens to others around the world, we feel on some level. This connectedness is most substantial between mothers and children. Thoughts and emotions can be transmitted between people, even over great distances.

- Many scientific experiments prove that our thoughts are powerful and can directly impact the physical world. Negative thoughts, in particular, can damage us and those around us.

- Trapped emotions are stuck in the body, often from past events. Nearly everyone carries trapped emotions, which can be released through muscle testing and intention. Releasing trapped emotions can have profound healing effects.

- The story of releasing a trapped emotion from the author's young son illustrates how trapped emotions can negatively impact our relationships and daily lives. After the trapped emotion was released, the boy's behavior improved dramatically, showing the power of this technique.

- The Emotion Code provides a deliberate and precise way to find and release trapped emotions, unlike other therapies where emotional release is more accidental or serendipitous. The Emotion Code allows you to surgically remove trapped emotions from the body and confirm they have been released.

- Initially, Dr. Nelson and his wife had only treated adults for trapped emotions. They decided to check their four-year-old son, Rhett, and found he had a trapped feeling of grief that originated from Dr. Nelson during an argument with his wife. Releasing it led to an immediate change in Rhett.

- This showed Dr. Nelson that children could benefit from trapped emotion release. A patient brought in her six-year-old daughter, who would hide from her pilot father when he returned from trips. Releasing her trapped, sorrowful emotion changed her behavior.

- Their other four-year-old twin son, Drew, had speech and developmental delays and many fears. Releasing his trapped emotions from a traumatic birth and early infancy made him talkative and less fearful overnight.

- Trapped emotions are common and can form during times of vulnerability. They vibrate at a particular frequency and cause surrounding tissues to resonate at that frequency.

- Two examples show how trapped emotion release helped a sad ten-year-old boy and a six-year-old boy with severe stomach problems.

- Releasing trapped emotions can relieve suffering for both children and adults. Trapped emotions form during intensely emotional events when the body is overwhelmed and unable to process the feeling. Not every emotional event creates a trapped emotion.

- Tuning forks are used to demonstrate resonance. When one tuning fork of a particular frequency is struck, other tuning forks vibrate. Trapped emotions work similarly, with their vibrations causing resonance in surrounding tissues.

• Our universe and everything, including our bodies, comprises vibrating energy. When energy vibrates at the same frequency, it resonates.

• Trapped emotions are balls of negative emotional energy trapped in our bodies, usually from past experiences we have not yet let go of. They vibrate at the frequency of the emotion and cause surrounding tissues to resonate at the same frequency.

• Trapped emotions attract similar emotions and make us more prone to those emotional states. They can make emotions feel disproportionately solid and hard to shake.

• Releasing trapped emotions can profoundly impact, eliminating problematic emotions and behaviors. Cases of people released from life-long anger issues and resentment toward old high school peers illustrate the power of freeing trapped emotions.

• Trapped emotions imbalance energy and make our bodies more vulnerable to health issues. They often lodge in areas already weak or injured. Sometimes they also install in rooms with symbolic significance, like fear in the chest or resentment in the womb.

• Trapped emotions negatively impact us mentally and physically. Mentally, they cause exaggerated emotional reactions. Physically, they can lead to pain, disease, and illness in the areas they inhabit. Releasing them can improve both mental and physical well-being.

• Every trapped emotion has a size and shape and vibrates at the frequency of the feeling. Though invisible, they are real and have a powerful impact until we release them. Freeing trapped emotions is simple and can profoundly change lives for the better.

Here's a summary:

- Trapped emotions are negative emotional energies that get stuck in the body. They can exert a powerful influence on our health and mood.

- Two examples illustrate the impact of trapped emotions:

1. Marie, whose trapped emotions related to her son's murder were causing her overwhelming grief and loss. Releasing these emotions allowed her to heal and find balance again.

2. Sarah, whose trapped emotion of sadness from JFK's assassination was lodged in her left breast, possibly contributing to her breast cancer. Releasing this emotion brought her emotional relief.

- Trapped emotions generate a specific energetic vibration and are connected in our mind to the events that caused them. They can cause us to overreact emotionally to similar circumstances.

- Trapped emotions distort the body's tissues over time, leading to pain, malfunction, and disease. They may influence genetics and accelerate aging. Releasing them can relieve symptoms and reverse disease.

- Tissues irritated by trapped emotions for a long time can change and become cancerous. Every cancer patient treated had trapped emotions in the malignant tissues, though they may have also been attracted there by the imbalance.

- In summary, trapped emotions can exert a profound effect on both our physical and emotional health. Releasing them can have significant benefits.

- Trapped emotions refer to emotional energies stuck in the body. They can be an unrecognized yet significant underlying cause of health issues and disease.

- Releasing trapped emotions is vital for health and well-being. Although they may have already contributed to a health condition, removing them can prevent further harm.

- Examples:

1. Rochelle had a baseball-sized tumor in her lung. Releasing trapped emotions of resentment, frustration, and abandonment from her past relationship may have contributed to the chemotherapy becoming more effective and the tumor disappearing.

2. Jean experienced severe pain in her ovary. Releasing six trapped emotions, including one from kindergarten, instantly relieved the pain. The feelings were related to distressing events in the lives of women close to her.

3. Jack had a debilitating tennis elbow for months. Releasing five trapped emotions from high school, all related to disappointing relationships, instantly relieved his pain and restore mobility. The emotions likely lodged in his forearm due to the stress and injuries from playing tennis in high school combined with the emotional distress.

4. Releasing trapped emotions in the author's father improved vision and tracking in his lazy eye within days.

- In summary, trapped emotions can cause pain, illness, and disease. Releasing them often results in significant improvements and even total healing. Detecting and removing them should be a vital part of health care.

- The author defines a phobia as an irrational, persistent fear. Trapped emotions are often the underlying cause of phobias.

- A client with 50 years of severe claustrophobia found relief after one Emotion Code session. Her trapped emotions were released, and her phobia disappeared.

- A woman had a phobia of even seeing pictures of airplanes. After releasing the trapped emotion created when reading about a plane crash years earlier, her aversion was instantly gone.

- Night terrors, unlike nightmares, seem unrelated to dreams and are often caused by trapped emotions. A 42-year-old woman had suffered night terrors for life, disrupting her family. She released emotions trapped when she was five and eliminated her night terrors within a week.

- PTSD is a debilitating disorder resulting from experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Releasing trapped emotions and Heart-Walls has brought relief from PTSD and depression.

- A man fell 85 feet hiking but physically recovered. However, he and his girlfriend developed panic attacks, anxiety, and PTSD. Using the Emotion Code eased his panic attacks and her fear and PTSD.

- A Vietnam veteran had PTSD and Parkinson's-like tremors. After nine months of Emotion Code treatment, he improved his moods, normalized his blood pressure, and nearly eliminated tremors. He shared his success with fellow veterans.

- A woman with lifelong trauma and PTSD from childhood found relief through diligent Emotion Code practice. Her fear and symptoms disappeared, her relationships improved, and she wrote a book about her experience.

- Releasing trapped emotions may prevent future problems and relieve current symptoms. A Vietnam veteran couldn't discuss his war experiences without rage. Releasing his trapped emotions allowed him to come home and transform his life.

- Kirlian photography reveals that all living things have energy fields. Ancient healers believed in the existence of a "human energy field" or life force.

- The author believes the human energy field is essentially our spirit. Our physical bodies are like temples that house our souls. The author had an experience where he glimpsed a patient's body as a "sacred temple."

- Our thoughts originate from our spirit and radiate energy that can affect others. All power is continuous and connected.

- Thoughts are powerful. In seminars, the author does a demonstration where audience members direct positive or negative thoughts at a volunteer, and it affects the volunteer's muscle strength. This shows that ideas alone can have a substantial effect, even from a distance.

- Negative thoughts weaken us, while positive reviews strengthen us. Our studies have power, and we must be careful about what we think since our thoughts also affect those around us.

- Love is the most potent force in the universe. It overcomes fear and darkness. We have the power to overcome negativity with positivity and love.

The key ideas are:

1. We have an energetic spirit/life force.
2. Thoughts have power and radiate energy that impacts us and others.
3. We must focus on positive thoughts of love to overcome negativity.

- The writer conducts an experiment where a volunteer has their arm pressed down by the writer to test their strength. The audience then sends either positive or negative thoughts to the volunteer. The volunteer's arm becomes more muscular when the audience sends positive thoughts. When the audience sends negative thoughts, the volunteer's arm becomes weaker. This shows that thoughts are energy and can have physical effects.

- Our positive or negative thoughts affect our energy and physical well-being. Negative thoughts can weaken the body. Although we are often unaware of the effects of power and ideas, our subconscious mind detects them.

- The universe and everything in it is made up of energy. Energy vibrates at different frequencies to form atoms and molecules, creating all matter. This is like Legos building up into complex structures.

- Quantum physics shows that subatomic particles, the minor units of energy, behave mysteriously. They are connected instantaneously over any distance, as shown in experiments where particles were split and still changed in unison. This suggests the energies have some intelligence.

- An experiment showed that a man's white blood cells, separated from him by miles, reacted instantly when he saw traumatic footage, showing the connectedness of all energy.

- The writer proposes that the universe is made of intelligent energy. Subatomic particles have intelligence in how they function to form all matter. This could mean that all power and all importance have innate intelligence. Everything in the universe is fundamentally composed of this intelligent energy.

- Some implications are that we are all deeply connected at an energetic level and that greater intelligence forces are underlying all existence. Our thoughts and consciousness are energy and part of this greater interconnected whole.

• The father of quantum theory said that matter originates and exists by a force that brings particles to vibration. He said an intelligent mind is behind this force, the matrix of all matter.

• Our intention is a form of energy that can cooperate with and obey our intention. Ancient healers understood that the universe is filled with intelligent energy that can respond to our intention.

• Jesus turned water into wine through intention and faith. The water obeyed his word because it was intelligent.

• The story of Peter walking on water shows how our faith and intention can change our reality. As Peter's faith diminished, he began to sink. The universe supports our beliefs - if we think we can't, we won't succeed. If we believe we can, we will be empowered.

• The author had a dream where she walked on air. The goal meant we could do what we believed we could if we were grateful to God. Belief + gratitude = the results we want.

• Masaru Emoto's research found that water exposed to positive words like "love and gratitude" formed beautiful crystals, while negative comments included disrupted crystals. Our bodies are mostly water, so positive thoughts are essential.

• Life is about developing love, gaining knowledge, serving others, feeling gratitude, and leading a joyful life.

- Trapped emotions make it difficult to experience joy and happiness. They negatively impact us physically and emotionally.

- Releasing trapped emotions can lead to incredible transformations. After releasing trapped emotions, a woman witnessed her grandmother gain cognitive and physical abilities.

- Scientists now know there is a human energy field. They can detect it using devices like the SQUID magnetometer. The energy fields around our body provide more information about our health than traditional tests like EEGs and EKGs.

- Western medicine has led to many advances but needs to account for the human energy field. Many alternative healing methods that address the energy field have gained more respect.

- There is abundant evidence that the human body is energetic, emotional, and spiritual. We now know we are beings of energy, and there is an intelligent force in the universe.

- Releasing trapped emotions has allowed many people to become their "true selves" and gain happiness, relaxation, and positivity.

- Although the body can heal itself, it often needs help through methods like releasing trapped emotions, chiropractic work, nutrition, etc. Healing takes time, though we usually want a "quick fix" through medication that only masks symptoms.

- Symptoms are the body's signaling that something is wrong and needs to be addressed. Ignoring them is like ignoring your car's "check engine" light.

- Releasing trapped emotions has helped many with conditions like depression. A patient went from suicidal thoughts daily to no longer considering suicide after releasing trapped emotions.

- The patient suffered from depression, panic attacks, and night terrors for years and didn't want to live.
- She attended one of Dr. Bradley Nelson's seminars and asked him for help. He performed an energy clearing on her, giving her an immediate boost in energy and joy.
- After working with Dr. Nelson, her symptoms disappeared. She no longer has panic attacks or night terrors and now embraces life.
- Releasing trapped emotions through techniques like the Emotion Code can be highly effective for chronic illnesses and pain. The underlying energetic cause needs to be addressed for proper healing.
- Two stories were shared: a woman with severe paranoia who improved after releasing 17 trapped emotions and a woman who was severely depressed but regained mental clarity and joy after using the Emotion Code.
- Magnets are an ancient healing tool and integral to the Emotion Code. They emit energy to help rebalance the body's energy field.
- Your body and existence extend beyond what you can see or feel physically. You are made of energy, and healing the energy body can have profound effects on the physical body.

- The human body generates an electromagnetic field produced by the electrical activity in our nervous system and cells. This field extends up to 12 feet from our body.

- In 1956, Japanese scientists proved the existence of electric and magnetic forces in the body. Exposing the body to electromagnetic fields affects cell metabolism. This is known as the piezoelectric effect.

- Although Western medicine accepts the existence of the body's electromagnetic field, it has primarily only measured the electrical component. Meanwhile, the magnetic aspect has been largely unexplored.

- Whenever there is electrical activity in the body, there is a corresponding magnetic field. Scientists can now measure these magnetic fields using magnetoencephalography and magnetocardiography.

- The brain's pineal gland, which secretes hormones affecting the whole body, is surrounded by magnetite clusters that sense magnetic fields. These clusters may relate to our sense of direction. A study found people with pineal gland calcification were more likely to get lost.

- Powerful magnets can make frogs and other animals levitate, showing interest and powerfully affecting physiology.

- When exposed to magnetic fields, the human body can experience healing effects, such as reduced illness, pain, vertigo, and fatigue. Although the mechanisms are not fully understood, magnets are used in some alternative therapies.

- A story of a woman named Martha described her depression of 20 years being cured using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. 75% of patients in a study showed improvement in depression using this method.

- The author was skeptical of magnets until seeing a patient's range of motion and pain improve immediately after using an interest. The patient's symptoms may have been due to a magnetic energy deficiency, corrected by the claim.

Here's a summary:

- The relief of Laura's fibromyalgia symptoms after using magnet therapy was an example of the miraculous healings the author has seen with magnets.

- The author believes many illnesses have underlying causes related to magnetic field deficiency syndrome (MFDS) or energy imbalance. Magnetic therapy can lead to a significant improvement in cases where MFDS is the primary cause.

- The author cites several examples of patients who experienced healing or symptom relief with magnet therapy, including a disc bulge disappearing, allergies and asthma improving, and bruises and broken bones healing acceleratedly.

- The author's uncle experienced knee cartilage regeneration after 60 years of pain and disability. His knee X-rays showed cartilage regeneration after using magnets for ten days. This demonstrated to the author that spontaneous healing previously thought impossible could occur.

- The author says medical knowledge and practices are constantly evolving. Many once-common practices have been abandoned as knowledge advances. Similarly, ancient healing methods that were once dismissed are now coming to be appreciated again. The Emotion Code combines ancient principles with magnet therapy.

- Intention and thought energy are crucial to healing. Magnets amplify intention and thought power, allowing anyone to practice healing that was once only possible for the very experienced.

- The acupuncture system, with its meridians and acupoints, provides a pathway for directing intention and thought energy into the body. Research has proven the existence of acupuncture meridians.

- The Governing Meridian is essential as it connects to all other meridians. It provides an ideal pathway for releasing trapped emotions by applying magnets and intention. The appeal amplifies the meaning, overcoming the trapped emotion's energy.

• Muscle testing, also known as kinesthetic testing or kinesiology, is a form of biofeedback that can be used to connect with the subconscious mind.

• Doctors have used muscle testing since the 1940s to evaluate muscle strength and injury. It has many applications beyond what doctors initially understood.

• Muscle testing can provide information about overall health, identify vulnerabilities, find the root cause of issues, determine what's bothering the body, and indicate if a treatment is working.

• It can indicate if trapped emotions are present and if they have been released.

• Holly's story illustrates the power of muscle testing. Holly nearly drowned as a child and had a fear of water. Muscle testing showed a trapped emotion from the near-drowning caused this fear. Releasing the trapped emotion eliminated Holly's fear of water.

• The body cannot lie. Our subconscious mind knows all and will reveal information through muscle testing.

• When appropriately done, muscle testing is very accurate and specific. It provides a direct link to the subconscious mind.

• For muscle testing to work, you need to believe in the process and be willing to accept information that comes through. It would help if you started with a clear mind, without preconceptions.

• The body's intelligence is involved in muscle testing. It's not a product of the conscious mind, so ego and desires do not influence the results. The information comes from a higher source.

• With practice, muscle testing can become second nature and an invaluable tool for self-discovery and helping others.

• The author's aunt, Gwen, learned a new healing technique called muscle testing that uses the body's responses to yes-no questions to identify trapped emotions. She practiced the design on the author, Holly, and found a trapped feeling of terror from when Holly nearly drowned at age four. Releasing this trapped emotion had unexpected benefits, changing Holly's anxiety around swimming and improving her children's behavior at swim lessons.

• Muscle testing provides insight into the mind and body. It can quickly find imbalances and the root cause of problems. The author uses it in the Emotion Code and Body Code healing methods she teaches.

• A seven-year-old boy, Bronson, suffered from severe night terrors. Muscle testing found trapped emotions of shock, terror, horror, and fear from when he nearly ran into traffic at age two. Releasing these emotions cured his night terrors.

• The author's daughter occasionally gets severe growing pains. One night, muscle testing found trapped emotions contributing to her pain. Releasing them eased her pain within minutes and allowed her to sleep. Clearing this energy may help prevent future problems in her joints and legs.

• The subconscious mind knows much more about our health and what we need than the conscious mind. As shown by how our bodies automatically handle essential functions, the subconscious knows everything inside us and what will help or harm us. Muscle testing can access this subconscious knowledge. Our subconscious responses are honest, showing whether something is good for us.

• As an example, people will sway forward when asked about "unconditional love" but backward when asked about something harmful. We can't fool our subconscious--it knows the truth instantly. The body has skills beyond our conscious awareness to keep us alive and healthy.

- The study involved giving participants in a lecture unmarked envelopes that either contained an artificial sweetener or organic vitamin C.
- Using muscle testing, the participants could determine whether the envelope they held contained the artificial sweetener or vitamin C. Their muscles tested weak when holding the artificial sweetener and strong when holding the vitamin C.
- This demonstrates that our subconscious mind can detect things more profoundly. Even though the envelopes were sealed, the reason could sense what was inside.
- The mind works like a computer connected to a database of human consciousness. This gives everyone access to genius and unlimited information.
- An example is given of using the Emotion Code to help a four-year-old boy who was very unhappy and had frequent nosebleeds. After less than a week of using the Emotion Code, the boy became happy, talkative, and playful. His nosebleeds also stopped.
- For effective muscle testing, a light touch is needed. It's about detecting subtle changes in muscle strength, not applying force.
- The amount of pressure and resistance used can be adjusted like a dimmer switch. Tiny, around 5%, is recommended.
- A baseline must be established by first muscle testing for a true statement about oneself to get a strong response, then false information to get a weak response. This confirms that the person is testable.
- To test another person, have them make a true statement followed by a false statement while applying gentle pressure to their arm. A solid response to the actual information and a weak to the incorrect information indicates that the person is testable.

The key points are that muscle testing can provide access to deep subconscious knowledge and that establishing proper technique, with a light touch and minimal pressure, is necessary to get accurate results.

During muscle testing, the arm lock or staying unlocked indicates whether the statement is true or false. To test, have the subject make a true statement about themselves and push down on their outstretched arm. The arm should stay locked. Have them make a false statement, and the arm should unlock, indicating a "no" response.

To improve muscle testing:

1. Use only enough pressure to get an answer. Start light and build up.

2. Adjust pressure and resistance as needed.

3. Increase pressure smoothly over 3 seconds.

4. Keep your arms and hands in the proper position.

5. Subject must be willing to be tested. Skeptical subjects are more challenging to try.

6. Experiment with different arm positions. Out to side can work too.

7. Watch tutorial videos to improve.

The leg length test:

1. Feel love, gratitude and pray for help.

2. Have the subject lie down with shoes on and lie straight.

3. Place thumbs under the arches of feet and the first two fingers over ankle bones.

4. Apply pressure to bring feet to the same position. Note any length difference.

5. Say "yes" and recheck. Length should stay the same or align.

6. Say "no" and recheck. Length difference may increase up to 1/2 inch for a "no."

The elbow test:

1. Feel love, gratitude and pray for help.

2. Have the subject bend the elbow and lock the upper arm to the side. Stabilize elbow.

3. Place two fingers on the end of the forearm.

4. Have them say their name. The arm should stay strong.

5. Have them say a false name. The arm should weaken.

For self-testing, use statements you know are true/false to start. Words like "love" and "war" or "yes" and "no" can help determine your response. The key is finding the right amount of pressure and resistance for you.

The hand solo method:

1. Feel love, gratitude and pray for help.

2. Use two adjacent fingers, like the index and middle. One provides resistance; one applies pressure.

3. Turn down the resistance finger's strength to about 5%.

4. Gently press down with a pressure finger. The resistance finger should move.

5. Say "yes" and retest. The resistance finger should feel locked.

6. Say "no" and retest. The resistance finger should give way.

7. Adjust pressure and resistance to get a clear response. Practice to improve.

You can use muscle testing on yourself to identify trapped emotions, as in the example. The hand solo method can be done discreetly without interrupting an activity. With practice, muscle testing yourself can become very useful.

- The writer describes several muscle testing and self-testing methods, including the Hand Solo, Falling Log, Hole-in-One, Ring-in-Ring, Elbow Flick, and Finger Pad Test.

- These methods involve holding certain finger positions and applying light pressure while saying "yes" or "no." If the finger position remains strong or locked for "yes" but weakens or unlocks for "no," that indicates an affirmative or negative response. The key is finding the correct resistance and pressure for precise results.

- The writer recommends starting with the Hand Solo method and then moving on to the Falling Log method. The Elbow Test and Flick Test are also recommended as easy and reliable. The Finger Pad Test detects subtle electrical changes in the body.

- Pendulums can also be used for self-testing by amplifying signals from the body. The pendulum does not provide the information; it is simply a tool for detecting signals from the person's body and nervous system.

- Several keys to successful self-testing are offered:

1. Feel love and gratitude for the subject. Offer a prayer for help.

2. Start with minimal resistance and pressure and adjust for precise results.

3. Trust your subconscious and body to provide accurate answers. Questioning the results can undermine the process.

4. Practice and stay with it. Self-testing can seem complicated at first but becomes more accessible with regular use.

The main points are that self-testing through muscle testing and pendulums can be helpful, and the writer offers guidance and specific methods for developing self-testing ability. These techniques can become valuable tools for gaining insight and advice with regular practice.

1. Muscle testing is a way to communicate with your subconscious mind. The pendulum shows the muscle response.

2. To use a pendulum:

- Feel love and gratitude for your subject. Offer a prayer.

- Sit comfortably with feet on the floor.

- Hold the pendulum chain between the thumb and forefinger. Adjust chain length.

- Brace your forearm on a surface but not your hand.

- Decide on a neutral position (either no movement or gentle swinging).

- Choose movements for "yes" (often clockwise) and "no" (often counterclockwise). Practice until clear.

- Test using true and false statements. Once consistent, use for Emotion Code.

3. Keep practicing a self-testing method until it becomes second nature. The sway test is the most straightforward but requires standing. Self-testing allows testing yourself and others.

4. Use minimal force. Discomfort means too much detail, which can cause injury. The appropriate amount of energy is like holding a ladybug. Look for subtle changes.

5. Don't focus on your fingers. Focus on the question or person. Allow the test to happen on its own, like typing.

6. Your intuition may provide an answer before the muscle test. Follow your intuition. Muscle testing helps develop intuition.

7. Communication doesn't have to be verbal. The body will respond through muscle tests like leg length testing. Pay attention to nonverbal communication.

- The author discovered he could communicate with a patient's body using nonverbal communication by thinking questions, and the patient's body would respond. He found this worked just as well as verbal communication.

- However, he encountered a problem with a patient named Bill, who wore an evil clown t-shirt. The author could not get Bill's body to respond to nonverbal questions when the clown image was uncovered. But when the photo was covered, the communication worked again. The author concluded that objects radiate vibrational energy, either positive or negative, that can affect a person's energy field.

- Sometimes muscle testing yields strange or inconsistent results. This can be because the person being tested or the tester has become "untestable" for some reason. Untestable means the person will try vital no matter what is said. This is usually temporary and can be caused by overload, dehydration, or misalignment in the neck. Overload means the mind is overwhelmed in processing information. Dehydration or neck misalignment can disrupt the connection between the mind and muscles.

- Another reason muscle testing may not work is because the subject does not believe in it or is uncomfortable with it. It may work better when the issue is alone and more relaxed.

- It is unethical to test someone without their permission. You should always explain the process and get consent before testing. Testing without consent is an invasion of privacy and can yield incorrect results. Never test a minor without parental consent. The same guidelines apply to animals.

In summary, the key points are:
Objects radiate energy that can affect us.
Overload, dehydration, or neck misalignment may make someone untestable.
Lack of belief or discomfort can also disrupt testing.
You must always get consent before testing someone.

• Muscle testing is meant to help with health and wellness, not predict the future or win the lottery. It can determine trapped emotions from past and present health issues.

• Don't use muscle testing to make significant life decisions. It can lead to neurotic behavior and unreliable results.

• Ask for divine guidance and help when muscle testing. The Creator knows the answers and wants to help.

• Be patient when learning muscle testing. It takes practice. Helping others heal is rewarding.

• Recheck your baseline periodically to ensure accurate testing, especially if testing takes longer.

• Keep your thoughts focused and clear during testing. Negative or distracted thoughts can influence the outcome.

• Fill your heart with love and gratitude. They are powerful forces that promote accurate testing.

• Don't diagnose medical conditions unless you are a doctor. Recommend people see a doctor for unusual symptoms.

• Don't worry about nonbelievers. Many people use muscle testing, and support is available.

• Lessons can be learned through your own healing experiences with muscle testing. Trust the process.

• We communicate with the subconscious mind and spiritual helpers during muscle testing. Unseen angels may assist.

• Angelic beings may have a vested interest in the healing and guide the muscle testing process. They can include family members in spirit.

The author describes releasing trapped emotions from oneself and others. Releasing trapped emotions is a simple process that involves discovering and removing one emotion at a time. Though we may have hundreds of trapped emotions, we can only remove them individually. Removing them one at a time allows us to honor each emotional experience. Removing too many at once would overwhelm our minds, spirits, and bodies.

The steps in the Emotion Code process are as follows:

1. Obtain permission from the subject (if working with another person)

2. Establish a baseline for testing using muscle testing

3. Determine if a trapped emotion exists

4. Determine which emotion it is

5. Release the trapped emotion

6. Check to see if the emotion was released

Before beginning, make sure you and the subject are comfortable. Turn off distractions. Follow the steps in order. Take your time and allow the process to unfold. Trust that your subconscious knows what needs to be released and will guide you.

1. Establish a baseline by having the subject make a true statement like "My name is (their name)," which should test strong, and a false statement that should test weak. This ensures the subject is testable.

2. Ask if a trapped emotion can be released now. If yes, proceed to the next step. If not, there are three possibilities:

- The subject has no trapped emotions (unlikely)
- Their subconscious mind is not ready to release an emotion now (the answer may change later)
- The subject has a Heart-Wall blocking emotions (you'll need to release this first)

3. Determine which column the emotion is in, either A or B, by asking questions. Narrow down to the correct row, then the specific feeling.

4. Clearly state the emotion you test for, e.g., "This trapped emotion is dread." Or ask in question form, e.g., "Is this trapped emotion dread?" Either way, look for a strong or "yes" muscle test response for the correct emotion.

5. To confirm, test the emotions before and after the target emotion, which should push "no" or weak. Only one feeling at a time will try as "yes."

6. Decide whether to frame the emotion testing as statements or questions but be consistent within one session. Either way will give the same response. Stating the emotions may be quicker once proficient.

7. Release the trapped emotion once identified, using the methods in the next chapter.

Does this summary cover the critical steps to identifying a trapped emotion? Let me know if you have any other questions.

- The word "dread" elicits a negative response due to its negative connotation. Even saying the word can make someone react negatively.

- Once you identify a trapped emotion, you have learned an essential part of the Emotion Code. You are accessing your subconscious intelligence.

- Sometimes, you need more information from the subconscious mind before it releases a trapped emotion. You may need to dig deeper by asking questions.

- The subconscious mind knows everything about the trapped emotion, including when it got trapped, who was involved, where it is lodged in the body, and how it affects the mind and body.

- You can identify when emotion got trapped by deducing the timeframe through a process of elimination, dividing life into periods. Muscle testing can determine the timeframe within a year, plus or minus.

- Trapped emotions are usually tied to a person, situation, or yourself. You can deduce the feeling by asking if it was connected to a person, their gender, their relationship, etc. Ask about a situation related to home, work, relationships, finances, etc.

- Sometimes, trapped emotions are absorbed by another person. The subconscious will want you to identify if it was absorbed before releasing it. Ask if it was from a male or female, their relationship, how much info is needed to remove, etc.

- Follow your intuition in deducing details about the trapped emotion. Even if you don't feel very intuitive now, you can develop it with practice. Ask minimal questions to get the needed info to release the emotion.

1. Identify the trapped emotion by asking questions and doing muscle testing. Questions could include:

- Is it anger? Resentment? Fear? Sadness? Etc.
- Did it happen in childhood? Teen years? Adulthood?
- Was it from a family member? Friend? Teacher? Etc.

Narrow it down until you identify the specific emotion and event.

2. Determine if you need more details about the trapped emotion. If not, proceed to release it.

3. Locate where the trapped emotion is lodged in the body if desired. Use muscle testing to determine if it's on the right side, left side, midline, above, or below the waist. Get more specific from there.

4. Release the trapped emotion by running a magnet over the governing meridian (middle of the forehead, over the top of the head, and down the back of the neck) 3 times. For another person, place the magnet at the base of their neck and slide it to the lower back three times.

5. Confirm the emotion has been released by muscle testing. If not, repeat step 4 with more focus and belief.

6. Releases are permanent. The same emotion can be lodged in the body from different events so that you may release many of the same feelings. But each individual trapped emotion, once released, will not return.

The keys are using muscle testing, asking specific questions, focusing on intention, and believing/faith in the process. Releases can have profound effects on physical and emotional health.

• Trapped emotions can contribute to specific life issues and problems. To find the trapped emotions connected to a particular topic, ask the subconscious mind direct questions about that issue. For example, ask if there are trapped emotions preventing weight loss, contributing to pain, blocking financial success, etc.

• Be careful not to project your expectations or assumptions onto others. Remain neutral and open-minded. Muscle testing is not 100% accurate, so avoid telling someone they were abused or traumatized based only on muscle testing results.

• You may find the same emotion, like anger, coming up repeatedly in different people. This could indicate you are projecting that emotion or resonating with it. Check-in with yourself and release your own trapped emotions of that type.

• Healing happens in layers. Repeat the Emotion Code process as directed by the subconscious mind. Don't get discouraged if an issue isn't resolved immediately. Expect miracles and excellent results, even from releasing just one trapped emotion. But complete healing may take multiple sessions.

• Follow the ethics of "first, not harm." Be very careful about projecting or making assumptions. Never accuse or make claims about abuse or trauma without concrete evidence. Report suspected current abuse to the proper authorities.

• Your own trapped emotions can interfere with sessions for others by resonating with their trapped emotions. Do regular Emotion Code sessions on yourself to clear your feelings and avoid resonance.

- The author initially had a Heart-Wall consisting of anxiety, heartache, and inherited despair that she released using the Emotion Code. She became calmer but still had underlying fear.

- She then discovered she had preconception-trapped emotions of fear of impending life on earth and grief of feeling separated from God. Releasing these emotions led to feeling happy, grateful, and excited about life.

- The author shares an experience of releasing a preconception-trapped emotion of fear. She saw a vision of conversing with God before conception. Her soul was afraid to leave God's presence and go to earth. God consoled her but said leaving the fear trapped would serve a purpose - it would affect how she lived and found her way back to God, but not prevent it.

- Releasing preconception-trapped emotions can have a profound impact, bringing peace, calm, and connection. They provide insight into our existence before conception.

- We inherit trapped emotions from our biological parents at conception. These can come from many generations back in our family tree.

- Inherited trapped emotions can affect our health, personality, relationships, and success in life. Releasing them can lead to significant improvements.

- The experiences of our ancestors can affect us through a mechanism known as epigenetic inheritance. Studies show that descendants of Holocaust survivors inherited genetic changes that made them more vulnerable to stress and PTSD.

- Releasing inherited trapped emotions led to significant reductions in the hayfever and allergies of a man whose father also suffered from severe hayfever.

- A woman found that releasing her inherited female shame and other inherited emotions freed her from constant fear and worry. She said she finally felt "off the matrix."

- Siblings can inherit different trapped emotions from their parents, which may contribute to differences in their personalities and behaviors. Nature, nurture, and inherited feelings all play a role.

- Releasing an inherited trapped emotion of sadness from her great-great-grandmother, who had lost a child, lifted a "sheer weight" from a woman and improved her relationships with her children.

- The Emotion Code helps make joy and healthy relationships possible by releasing the inherited trapped emotions that can undermine them.

Here is a summary of the key points:

• Releasing inherited trapped emotions can profoundly affect emotional and physical well-being. By clearing these emotions, you can improve your relationships and mental health.

• Inherited trapped emotions are shared between family members across generations. Releasing one from any member releases it from all who hold it. This is the only case where removing someone else without permission is appropriate.

• Inherited trapped emotions are often uncovered accidentally while searching for regular trapped emotions. Asking about "inherited" emotions can help identify them. Confusing answers during the search may also indicate an inherited feeling.

• Identifying the ancestor who initially trapped the emotion is essential. Questioning usually starts with parents, then grandparents, and further back until the source is found. After a few generations, the exact source becomes less important. The number of ages it goes back can be estimated.

• Releasing inherited trapped emotions uses the same process as regular ones, but requires ten passes of the magnet or hand instead of 3. Releasing should be done with the intention to clear the emotion from all who hold it, living or dead. Confirmation that it is removed from close family members is helpful.

• Releasing inherited trapped emotions can have life-changing effects, improving relationships, physical health, mental well-being, and joy in life. Clearer thinking and weight loss are other possible benefits. Impact on children and descendents may also be seen.

• Examples show releasing inherited betrayal and abandonment eliminating chronic back and thigh pain, and helping a father find forgiveness and connection with his children before passing away.

The key takeaway is that clearing negative emotional energies passed down through generations can benefit individuals, families, and posterity enormously. Identifying and releasing these inherited trapped emotions is a gift we can give to our ancestors and descendants.

Here is a summary of the passage:

- The author wanted to fly her parents to attend her daughter's high school graduation. Her father suffered from severe claustrophobia and anxiety about flying and crowds.

- With her father's consent, the author worked to release his trapped emotions by proxy. She found and released several trapped emotions related to his claustrophobia, including an inherited trapped feeling of lost going back many generations. Releasing this emotion reduced 51% of his claustrophobic symptoms.

- Releasing inherited trapped emotions can help free future generations from suffering the effects of those emotions. The spirits of departed ancestors seem to show up when their trapped emotions are being released from their descendants. Releasing the trapped emotions helps lighten the emotional burden for all who have carried that emotion.

- A woman reported seeing hundreds of spirits surrounding the stage during a demonstration of trapped emotion release. She said the spirits were the yet-to-be-born descendants of the woman, rejoicing that they would not inherit her trapped emotion.

- Releasing trapped emotions helps lighten the load for ancestors who have passed on, though they are no longer in physical bodies. People report sensing deep connections with ancestors when releasing emotions inherited from them.

- A woman released an inherited trapped emotion of hopelessness passed down through 27 generations. She felt waves of gratitude, relief, letting go of pain, and joy, as if crying "a thousand tears" for all those who had suffered from that emotion.

- A woman released an inherited trapped emotion from 6 generations back on her mother's side. She was overcome with joy, gratitude and tears as the women from her past family approached and thanked her.

- A woman's practitioner released an inherited trapped emotion from 13 generations back on her father's side, from a man described as having black hair, black beard and a top hat. A week later, the woman woke in the night and released another inherited trapped emotion, then felt surrounded by a crowded room of spirits.

The author had a Heart-Wall created by a series of trapped emotions from painful experiences in her past. This Heart-Wall caused her to close herself off emotionally and have difficulty connecting deeply with others. After Dr. Nelson released her Heart Wall using the Emotion Code, she felt an immediate shift. Her heart opened up and she felt more joy, love, and connection.

Soon after, she met a wonderful man and they fell deeply in love. They had an almost fairy-tale-like romance and ended up getting married. She attributes finding this fantastic love to removing her Heart Wall and opening her heart. She believes that without the Heart-Wall release, she never would have attracted her soul mate or been open to such a deep, loving relationship.

Releasing trapped emotions and Heart-Walls can open you up to healthier relationships by removing emotional baggage and barriers around your heart. When your heart opens, you become a magnet for love and connection.

• The author is a doctor who discovered the Heart-Wall phenomenon.

• In 1998, his wife Jean had a dream indicating she had three health issues. They figured out the meaning of the first two issues but were puzzled by the third.

• When focusing on the third issue, the author had a waking vision of a polished hardwood floor over Jean's heart. This made no sense but felt significant.

• The author questioned Jean and determined that the floor represented emotional protection she had built up over years of hardship and heartbreak. This energetic barrier blocked her heart's energy and emotions.

• They developed a muscle testing technique to locate and release trapped emotions making up the Heart Wall. Removing Jean's Heart-Wall led to better health and relationships.

• The Heart-Wall discovery led to healing many patients. Heart-Walls block our ability to give and receive love fully and cause emotional and physical problems.

• Releasing the Heart-Wall allows access to inner joy, enhanced intuition, and improved relationships. Our hearts' intelligence and energy have a profound effect on our lives.

• The story illustrates how intuition and synchronicity led to a medical discovery that has helped many people. Our hearts and bodies have an innate wisdom we can tap into.

- Jean's sister-in-law Lana sensed some energy over Jean's heart. Jean wondered if this was what Lana was picking up on.

- Upon further reflection and prayer, they realized this 'energy' was a 'wall' made up of trapped emotions built around Jean's heart. This wall was created by Jean's subconscious mind as a protective mechanism when she was a child to shield her sensitive heart from emotional pain.

- As a child, Jean grew up in a dysfunctional household where she frequently felt unsafe and insecure. Her subconscious mind built the 'heart-wall' using trapped emotions as a shelter to protect her heart.

- The 'heart-wall' protected Jean's heart but also caused her to feel emotionally numb and disconnected from others. She had trouble forming close relationships.

- Jean's 'heart-wall' was represented by a hardwood floor, symbolizing how vulnerable her heart felt and how it needed protection. Her subconscious mind began building the wall at age two and added more layers whenever extra protection was needed.

- Releasing the trapped emotions from Jean's 'heart-wall' brought profound changes. She no longer felt like an outsider and was able to form closer connections with others. Releasing the 'heart-wall' often leads to feeling profoundly connected to other people.

- Overall, the 'heart-wall' protected Jean in her childhood but ultimately kept her emotionally blocked off and disconnected. Releasing it brought emotional freedom, closer relationships, and a new sense of belonging.

• Joanne was in a bad marriage for 22 years. Her husband was emotionally and verbally abusive. To protect herself, Joanne's subconscious mind built a Heart-Wall.

• After releasing Joanne's Heart Wall, she realized the extent of the cruelty in her relationship and divorced her husband within two weeks.

• Justin felt lighter, more confident, and able to manage his emotions better after releasing his Heart Wall.

• We need a Heart-Wall temporarily in traumatic situations. But living with a long-term Heart-Wall is like living in a bunker, disconnected from life. Releasing a Heart-Wall can transform your life.

• Miranda had neck pain and had not dated for years due to a Heart-Wall from a past heartbreak. After releasing her Heart-Wall, her neck pain disappeared, and she reconnected with her childhood sweetheart.

• We are meant to live vibrant, connected lives filled with love. But Heart-Walls block our ability to give and receive love fully. Releasing Heart-Walls can significantly improve lives.

• Rachel embraced self-love and received love from others after releasing her Heart Wall.

• Releasing a Heart-Wall can have dramatic effects immediately, but changes are often subtle. It allows for healthier relationships and a more joyful life over time.

- Heart-Walls and trapped emotions can appear gradually in children, often without fully realizing the effects.

- A nine-year-old boy developed depression and behavioral issues after witnessing traumatic events and forming a Heart-Wall. Releasing his Heart-Wall led to a dramatic improvement in his mood, behavior, and school performance.

- A three-year-old boy formed a Heart-Wall after the death of his twin brother shortly after birth. Releasing his Heart Wall transformed his behavior from angry, destructive, and unhappy to helpful, kind, and pleasant.

- An eight-year-old girl developed a stutter three years prior that had been worsening. Releasing her Heart-Wall and trapped emotions eliminated her stutter immediately and led to improved mood and creativity.

- In all cases, releasing the children's Heart-Walls and trapped emotions had profound and transformative effects on their well-being, behavior, and development. The improvements were noticed quickly by parents, teachers, and the children themselves.

Here is a summary of the key points about the Heart-Wall:

• The Heart-Wall is an energetic barrier of trapped emotions that surrounds the heart and prevents a person from freely giving and receiving love.

• To determine if someone has a Heart-Wall, ask their subconscious mind. About 93% of people will test as having a Heart-Wall.

• A Heart-Wall can sometimes be "hidden" and not appear unless you use the word "hidden" in your questioning. Using "hidden" will reveal the Heart Wall.

• Before releasing emotions from the Heart-Wall, ask if the person can remove them. Their subconscious mind knows what is best for them.

• Releasing emotions from the Heart Wall uses the same Emotion Code process as releasing regular trapped emotions. The subconscious mind determines which emotions are released and in what order.

• After releasing emotions from the Heart-Wall, processing time is often needed before removing more. This can take hours to days. Check with the subconscious mind to see when more can be removed.

• Releasing the Heart-Wall and its trapped emotions can lead to an increased sense of joy, calm, peace and ability to give and receive love. Relationships can improve. Physical pain and health issues are often relieved.

• The effects of releasing the Heart-Wall are life-changing for many people. They finally feel free to live and love fully.

That covers the essential highlights about the Heart-Wall according to the information given. Please let me know if you would like me to explain anything in the summary in more detail.

Surrogate testing allows you to muscle test another person as a surrogate for someone physically present but unable to be tested directly. It works because our energy fields extend around us for about six feet. The surrogate can tap into the subject's subconscious to get answers within that range.

Reasons someone may need a surrogate:

- Age: infants, small children, elderly
- Physical limitation: injury, illness
- Mental state: unconscious, coma, severe anxiety or PTSD
- Language barrier
- Lack of understanding of muscle testing

The surrogate is muscle tested in place of the subject. Their arm will go weak when you mention a trapped emotion that needs to be released from the issue. The surrogate taps into the subject's energy field and subconscious to get this information. Surrogate testing allows us to help even those who can't be tested directly. It is a valuable tool for the Emotion Code.

In summary, surrogate testing provides a way to help free people and animals of trapped emotions when they can't be tested themselves. It allows us to assist infants and children, those ill, and even those at a distance. Surrogate testing expands the reach of the Emotion Code.

1. Loss of consciousness or ability to communicate: Subject is asleep, in a coma or has an intellectual disability.

2. Surrogate must be within 6 feet of subject and testable. Surrogate does not need to touch subject.

3. To test using self as surrogate:

- Feel love for subject and pray for help.
- Ensure you are testable.
- Confirm you are reading subject's energy by having them say their name. Response should be strong. Check by having them say wrong word. The answer should be weak.
- If not clear, repeat until transparent then proceed.

4. To use another person as surrogate:

- Feel love for subject and pray for help.
- Ensure surrogate is testable.
- Have subject say their name. Test surrogate. Response should be strong.
- Have subject say wrong name. Test surrogate. Response should be weak.
- If not clear, repeat until transparent then proceed.

5. Ask questions of subject but test surrogate. Release trapped emotions by passing magnet down subject's back or surrogate's back.

6. Surrogate testing works for children. She helped 2.5 year old Julie by releasing inherited and absorbed trapped emotions. Her cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, asthma, ADHD, and constant agitation improved after removing her Heart-Wall.

Betty adopted Julie as a baby. Julie had many health issues like severe asthma, cerebral palsy, and behavioral problems. Betty took Julie to see Dr. Nelson, who used the Emotion Code to release trapped emotions in Julie. After 13 treatments, Julie's health and behavior improved dramatically. Her asthma and medicines were no longer needed. Her speech and walking were also enhanced. Julie became a different, happier child with no more fits.

The Emotion Code can help improve health and behavioral issues in children by releasing their trapped negative emotions. Julie's case shows how her health and development benefited from the Emotion Code.

In another story, 5-year-old Eliza feared water before an Emotion Code surrogate session. After the session, she was no longer afraid and enjoyed playing in the bathtub.

The Emotion Code was also used to help a 6-month-old baby with trouble sleeping and eating. After releasing some of his trapped emotions and his parents' stress, the baby's sleep and digestion improved.

Surrogate testing allows you to test and release trapped emotions from people or animals that cannot be tested directly. It can be used on pets, infants, unconscious people, or those in too much pain. It would help if you had permission from the subject or their guardian before using surrogate testing.

Proxy testing is similar but allows you to work on people at a distance. The proxy acts as a substitute for the subject, and their body is used for testing to benefit the issue. Proxy testing, a form of distance healing, was used to help a ballerina in Japan who had hurt her hip. Releasing two of her trapped emotions resolved her hip pain even though she was in another country.

- Dorene, a patient, shared her experience with proxy testing. She received instant relief from hiatal hernia symptoms during a phone call with her doctor. The doctor tested and released trapped emotions in Dorene through proxy testing.

- Proxy testing involves establishing an energetic connection between a proxy (the person being tested) and the subject (the person the session is for). This can be done with one person acting as both proxy and tester or with two people, one as proxy and one as a tester.

- To do proxy testing, first, obtain permission from the subject. Then, establish a connection between the proxy and subject by having the broker say, "My name is [subject's name]" until the proxy tests the firm. Confirm the link, then proceed with testing and releasing as usual. Release trapped emotions by running a magnet or fingertips down the proxy's governing meridian.

- The proxy's needs are set aside temporarily while connected to the subject. Anything tested or released on the broker happens to the topic. The connection allows you to try and remove someone far away.

- It's essential to break the connection when done to avoid the proxy experiencing the subject's emotions. Have the broker say their name until they test strong.

- Stories of using proxy testing to help children, pets and others with positive results were shared. Proxy testing can be profoundly helpful.

- The subconscious mind of the proxy temporarily serves the subject in a sacred way during proxy testing.

- Animals experience emotions and are trapped in emotions just like humans. Releasing trapped emotions from animals can help improve their health and behavior.

- The process for releasing trapped emotions from animals is very similar to the process for humans. You use the Emotion Code Chart to identify trapped emotions and remove them using magnets or your fingertips.

- You can work on animals using surrogate testing if you are within 6 feet of the animal. Have the surrogate stand near the animal while you muscle test the surrogate. Release the trapped emotions by swiping a magnet down the animal's back or the surrogate's governing meridian.

- For animals farther away, use proxy testing. Establish an energetic connection to the animal by focusing on them and stating its name while muscle testing yourself. The weak response will get stronger, indicating you have connected. Release trapped emotions by swiping a magnet down your own governing meridian.

- The key is speaking to the animal's subconscious mind, even though the animal can't verbally respond. Ask yes/no questions to identify trapped emotions, just as you would with a human client.

- Releasing trapped emotions in animals can help with health and behavior issues, just as in humans. Many animals are very receptive to this work.

- The basic process is the same for all animals, wild or domestic. You may need to do proxy testing for wild animals or those that may become aggressive. Gently swiping a magnet down the animal's back is best when possible and safe.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key points about releasing trapped emotions from animals? Let me know if you want me to clarify or expand on any summary part.

Here's a summary:

To test animals remotely using a proxy:

1. Feel love for the animal and silently pray for help.

2. Ensure the proxy person is testable and get a baseline by testing yes/no questions.

3. Have the proxy say "My name is [animal's name]" until you get a substantial muscle test, indicating a connection.

4. Confirm the connection by having the proxy say their name, which should test weak.

5. Release trapped emotions by swiping a magnet down the proxy's governing meridian.

6. Break the connection by having the proxy say their name until you get a substantial test.

To test animals in person:

1. Feel love for the animal, gratitude to help them, and pray for help.

2. Ensure the animal is testable and get a baseline.

3. Say "My name is [animal's name]" until you get a substantial test, indicating a connection.

4. Confirm the connection by saying your name, which should test weak.

5. Release trapped emotions by swiping down the animal's governing meridian.

6. Break the connection by saying your name until you get a substantial test.

Examples of using the Emotion Code on animals:

- A vomiting dog was cured by releasing trapped emotions of trauma from being separated from her mother and dietary changes.

- A dog named Twiggs was sad at being taken by a coyote and lost interest in life. Releasing his trapped sadness instantly cured him.

- A dog named Brandy was humping visitors' legs out of grief from being left behind on trips. Releasing his grief stopped the behavior.

- A paranoid cat named Boofy was hiding and hissing due to a trapped emotion of betrayal from a past owner who abandoned him. Releasing it made him friendly and social again.

The Emotion Code can work instantly and profoundly on animals by directly addressing the underlying emotional cause of problems. Animals can't fake improvement, so results tend to be very obvious.

- Katrina adopted a cat named Boofy who was fearful of strangers. After using the Emotion Code to release Boofy's trapped emotion of fear, Boofy became friendly towards visitors. Katrina now has a pet therapy business using the Emotion Code with animals.

- Katrina's friend found abandoned puppies by a river. Katrina used the Emotion Code to release the puppies' trapped emotions of terror, shock, fear, betrayal, and abandonment. The puppies were then able to be adopted into good homes.

- Michelle had bullying chickens that prevented other chickens from eating, drinking, and laying eggs. After using the Emotion Code on the chickens, the bullying behavior stopped.

- A fearful chocolate Lab named Jazzy was on anxiety medication after years in a puppy mill. After two Emotion Code sessions, Jazzy showed huge improvements and no longer needed medication.

- A horse named Valiant had problems with his gait that vets couldn't diagnose. Using the Emotion Code, trapped emotions of sorrow relating to witnessing a baby bird die were released. Valiant's gait problem was then cured.

- A horse owner had two horses, Newt and Rosie, treated with the Emotion Code. Newt had been retired for years due to pain and low energy from an anthill attack, but improved dramatically after a session.

- Emotions are a natural part of the human experience. Feeling and releasing emotions appropriately is healthy. However, trapped emotions - emotions that are denied or interrupted before being fully felt and released - can cause damage. It is possible to release trapped emotions and learn skills to prevent new ones from forming.

- Life provides many opportunities for emotional experiences, both positive and negative. How we respond to and work through these experiences shapes our character and connections to others. By developing emotional intelligence, we can gain more control over our emotional reactions and choose healthier responses.

- One way emotions become trapped is through emotional denial - refusing to feel or acknowledge the emotion. This is often an unconscious habit learned in childhood. Emotional denial prevents essential messages from the body and subconscious from being received. It leads to emotional and physical distress. Releasing trapped emotions of rejection and changing beliefs about certain emotions can help break this habit.

- No one can make you feel any emotion you don't choose. While events may trigger emotional reactions, you ultimately decide how to handle and respond. Emotional responses often seem automatic, but they follow patterns your subconscious mind creates. By releasing trapped emotions and gaining awareness and skill, you can choose healthier emotions and responses. You have the power to determine your emotional state regardless of circumstances.

• We often react negatively out of habit and past programming. We can respond differently by slowing down and taking control of our emotions.

• Our focus and the emotions we choose to feel determine our reality and experiences. Choosing to focus on positive aspects leads to a happier outlook.

• Dwelling on past adverse events can create trapped emotions and make us feel bad in the present. We can look back on the past with love by focusing on positive memories. Releasing trapped emotions related to past events can help us find more peace.

• We can reroute our emotional reactions by slowing down, identifying our feelings, determining the underlying cause, releasing any related trapped emotions, and choosing to feel a positive emotion instead. This takes practice but can become second nature.

• There are many positive emotions we can choose from, like joy, gratitude, acceptance, and kindness. Choosing positive emotions helps us attract more of what we want in life.

• The law of attraction means that we attract what we focus on, whether positive or negative. Feeling good about what we want helps us create it. Focusing on lack keeps us stuck in scarcity. Our thoughts and emotions create our reality all the time.

• We are always in a state of creation based on our thoughts and emotions. What we predominantly think and feel is what we will continue to attract and manifest in our lives. Choosing positive thoughts and feelings is critical.

Here's a summary:

• Both conscious and unconscious thoughts influence your outcomes and experiences. Negative subconscious thoughts from trapped emotions can undermine your conscious positive thinking. Releasing trapped emotions helps shift your subconscious thoughts to be more positive.

• You always have a choice in the emotions you experience. Even under challenging circumstances, you can choose more positive emotions like hope and love. Releasing trapped emotions makes it easier to choose positive emotions.

• Resistance to what has happened, is happening, or may happen leads to suffering and negative emotions. Acceptance allows for peace, connection, compassion, and alignment with divine will. Releasing trapped emotions helps shift from resistance to acceptance.

• Forgiving others and accepting divine will are difficult when in a state of resistance but become easier when resistance is released.

• Physical problems can result from the chaotic energy state caused by resistance and negative emotions. Releasing trapped emotions restores the flow of energy and health.

• Being willing to be wrong and make mistakes frees you from judgment and opens you to learning and growth. Releasing trapped emotions makes it easier to adopt this willingness to be incorrect.

• Releasing a Heart-Wall and other trapped emotions can lead to feeling more love, joy and creativity as barriers to these are removed. Judgment of self and fear of others' judgment is diminished. A sense of freedom and lightness results.

• The Emotion Code process can be challenging but leads to valuable results like improved health, better relationships, decreased suffering, and a higher vibration. Regular practice compounds the benefits.

The author found that releasing her Heart-Wall allowed her to rediscover her true self and share that with others. She was able to lose weight more quickly and stick to a nutritious diet. She felt like she rediscovered her childhood joy of drawing without judgment or concern for what others thought.

Releasing negative emotions and forgiving others sets us free from suffering. Holding onto hurt only hurts us, not the other person. We should accept that we cannot control how others feel and choose to let go of the past. A story is shared about a woman who forgave the teenager who threw a turkey through her windshield and caused permanent injuries. By ignoring him, she allowed him to take responsibility, serve only six months in jail and have a chance at a future rather than 25 years in prison.

The ability to forgive comes from our ability to love unconditionally. Unconditional love helps us avoid getting trapped emotions by allowing us to understand others, judge less and show more compassion. It helps us focus outward and be less self-centered. Unconditional love brings peace, joy, and harmony. It is a gift from God that comes from the heart.

Living with integrity, in line with our truths and values, makes us less likely to get trapped emotions. Integrity brings peace between our hearts and mind. While life challenges may still cause trapped emotions, we can see them as blessings for growth. Hard times often benefit us the most.

In life, we encounter opposition and trying circumstances that can evoke negative trapped emotions within us. We must be vigilant to check ourselves for these trapped emotions and release them to avoid their harmful effects.

Life is a progression of learning, purifying, and ascending to a higher level of consciousness. Our experiences, though sometimes painful, are meant to refine us. Like silver, we are purified through the fire of adversity. The refining process is complete when God sees His reflection in us.

Prayer helps us receive divine guidance and align with the refining process. We can pray for help in all areas of life, especially helping others. A simple prayer to God expressing gratitude, asking for help and guidance, and closing "in the name of Jesus Christ, amen" can be very effective.

Releasing trapped emotions contributes to wellness and allows us to live life more fully and help others more profoundly. Assisting others to heal and empower them brings deep joy. We each have a destiny to fulfill by serving and lifting others.

Though the trials of life may seem overwhelming, we must remember that God loves us and has a purpose for us. We are spiritual beings having a mortal experience. We aim to raise our consciousness and become like our Creator - able to give pure love unconditionally.
