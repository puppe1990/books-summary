- The book is dedicated to the author’s father and mentor, who taught 
him the principles of the Compound Effect. 

- The secret to success is not really a secret. The strategies in this book, 
when applied consistently over time, will lead to success. Success requires 
persistence and consistency, not a “magic pill.”

- The author has seen many success stories as the publisher of SUCCESS 
magazine. “Nothing works like the power of the Compound Effect of 
simple actions done right over time.” 

- The author thanks his team at SUCCESS, his writing partner, editors, the 
experts he has worked with, readers, and his wife for their support.

- Anthony Robbins, the author’s mentor, wrote a letter praising the book.
Robbins says success comes from understanding and applying proven tools 
and strategies, not luck. He has known the author for 16 years and says the 
book is based on what has worked for the author’s life and Robbins’ own life.

- The book teaches readers how to harness the power of the Compound Effect, 
which has been influencing their lives for better or worse. By using the Compound 
Effect to their advantage, readers can achieve anything they set their mind to.

- The author knows the Compound Effect works because he has applied the principles 
to his own successful life and business. He won’t promote unrealistic “get rich quick” 
messages. The book focuses on timeless success fundamentals that anyone can apply 
to see real results.

 

- The author attributes his success to the "Compound Effect" - the principle of achieving massive success through small, consistent actions over time. 

- His father, a former football coach, instilled this mindset in him from an early age through strict discipline, hard work, and consistency. His father taught him that "slow and steady wins the race."

- Some examples of his father's "Compound Effect" principles:

1) Waking up at 6 AM every day for an intense workout. His father never missed a day. 

2) Endless chores and high expectations for achievement. Excuses were not tolerated.

3) The philosophy that "you need to make up in hard work what you lack in experience, skill, intelligence, or innate ability." If you're at a disadvantage, just work 3-4 times as hard. 

4) Taking personal responsibility. His father didn't constantly remind him to do his homework or chores. He had to show up with the results. 

5) Being disciplined and dedicated enough to achieve whatever goals were set. His father instilled a "no excuses" mindset.

- Thanks to these principles, the author achieved massive success at a young age, becoming a self-made millionaire by age 27. He attributes his success to mastering the "Compound Effect" - the culmination of small, consistent actions over time.

- The core message is that anyone can achieve extraordinary success through consistent dedication and hard work over an extended period of time. Success is not the result of shortcuts or "get rich quick" schemes. It's the product of continuous progress and perseverance.

 

- The Compound Effect refers to the principle of achieving massive success through small, smart choices that are made consistently over time. Though the steps seem insignificant, the outcomes can be huge. 

- Most people fail to see the power of the Compound Effect because the changes are subtle and there is no immediate payoff. But over the long run, these small changes can lead to radical differences.

- The example of the magic penny illustrates this. Choosing a penny that doubles in value every day for a month leads to over $10 million, far more than $3 million in cash. But for most of the month, the penny choice seems inferior. It's only at the very end that its power becomes clear.

- The example of the three friends shows how small changes sustained over time can lead to big differences. Over 30 months, one friend who cuts 125 calories a day loses 33 pounds, while another friend who adds 125 calories a day gains 33 pounds. Other aspects of their lives change dramatically as well. 

- Even one small change can have ripple effects through the Compound Effect. For example, one friend baking more treats leads to weight gain, fatigue, poorer work performance, relationship issues, less exercise, and a downward spiral. Small changes can compound for better or worse.

- The key is to make small, smart choices and sustain them over time. This can lead to profound success and turn you into an "overnight success" story, though in reality it's due to steady progress over the long run.

 

Brad’s wife starts complaining and becoming needy when her emotional needs are not met. When that does not work, she withdraws emotionally to protect herself. She feels lonely. She pours her energy into work and spends more time with friends to fulfill her need for companionship. Men start flirting with her, which makes her feel desirable again. Though she would never cheat on Brad, he senses something is wrong. Instead of recognizing that his own poor choices and behavior are the root of their problems, Brad blames his wife.

Believing the other person is at fault rather than looking within and making necessary changes is basic psychology. Brad does not know he needs to look within, since he does not seek self-improvement or relationship advice. Though Brad's friend Scott reads self-help books and improves himself, Brad does not. The small choices Brad makes each day create bigger problems in all areas of his life.

In contrast, Scott's self-improvement and intellectual stimulation yield positive results. Small daily disciplines lead to very different outcomes over time through the Compound Effect. Success is predictable based on our habits and disciplines. 

The Compound Effect requires consistent action over time to see results. Quick fixes and "get rich quick" schemes usually do not work. Success requires hard work and discipline, not just luck or occasional big efforts. Many empires and people fail due to complacency from success. We must maintain the habits and disciplines that led to success.

To illustrate, a restaurant that opened and was initially very successful failed within 18 months because the staff became complacent, snooty, and the food quality declined. Success caused them to stop doing what made them successful. 

We must reject the expectation of instant results and quick fixes. Success requires mundane daily discipline over time through the Compound Effect. You can achieve your dreams by harnessing the Compound Effect through small, positive changes and actions each day. The Compound Effect is always working, either for or against you, depending on your choices and habits. You must choose to put it to work for you.

 

The choices you make shape your life. Whether big or small, each choice has an impact through the Compound Effect. Most of the time, people make choices unconsciously and end up with unintended consequences. It’s important to wake up and make empowering choices deliberately. 

Rather than blaming others, take 100 percent responsibility for your life and experiences. For example, to improve your relationship, focus on the positive qualities of your partner by keeping a “Thanks Giving” journal where you write one thing you appreciate about them each day. This can transform your view of them and your relationship.

By taking ownership of your choices and having an abundant mindset focused on gratitude, you gain the power to change your life’s direction and habits. Your choices become your best friend rather than your worst enemy.

 

- The author believes that you are responsible for everything in your life - your choices, actions, responses and outcomes. Taking full responsibility for your life is empowering. 
- Most people blame external factors for their problems instead of taking responsibility. But if you blame traffic for being late or a coworker for a mistake, you are not taking full responsibility. You are responsible for your choices and responses.
- Luck is not something that just happens to you. Luck is the result of preparation, mindset, opportunity and action. Everyone has the opportunity to make their own luck. Successful people recognize opportunities and take action. 
- The author shares an example of losing $330,000 in a business due to his own poor choices and lack of responsibility. He learned from this experience at the "University of Hard Knocks". He took responsibility for the loss instead of blaming his partner. 
- The author recommends tracking your progress and choices to build awareness and make better choices. Pick an area of your life to improve and track every choice and action related to that area. This tracking and awareness helps create accountability and leads to improved habits and results. 
- The author shares an example of owing $100,000 in taxes due to poor financial tracking and lack of awareness of where his money was actually going. This was a sobering lesson in the importance of tracking choices and outcomes.

In summary, the key messages are: take responsibility for your life, recognize that you shape your own luck, learn from your mistakes and experiences, build awareness through progress tracking, and take action based on that awareness to improve your habits and results.

 

The author's accountant advised him to track all of his spending for 30 days to gain awareness of how much money was flowing out of his pockets. Doing so was eye-opening and helped the author change his spending habits and get out of debt. 

The author recommends tracking any behavior you want to improve, whether it's eating, exercise, productivity, or relationships. Tracking brings awareness and accountability, which are required to make changes. Like professional athletes, you need metrics to know how you're doing and make adjustments.

The author recommends starting by tracking one area, like eating, for 3 weeks. Write down everything, no matter how small.  This simple act can shock you with how much you're actually consuming. But after a few weeks, you'll start making better choices automatically.

As an example, the author shows how a $4 daily coffee habit can cost $51,833 over 20 years due to the compounding effect of money over time. Every dollar you spend today costs you $5-10 in the future. Looking at prices through this lens can help you make better spending decisions.

In summary, tracking your behaviors consistently over time leads to awareness and better choices. Making small but consistent better choices through tracking can have a huge impact on your life due to the compound effect.

 

The small, seemingly insignificant changes you make in your life through tracking and discipline can have an enormous impact over time through the compound effect.  These small changes often go unnoticed by others but can result in exceptional outcomes. Success is achieved through many small wins, not overnight victories. 

For example:

- A CEO improved his company's culture and profits by simply committing to walk around his office building a few times a week and personally recognize employees.  
- An assistant went from earning $40K to over $250K/year by consistently saving and investing just 1-3% more of her income each month.  Over 10 years, her income increased over 1000%.  
- Starting to save and invest early, even with small amounts, results in significantly greater wealth over time due to compound interest.  For example, saving $250/month starting at age 23 can yield over $1M by age 67.  Starting at age 40, saving the same amount for 27 years yields less than $300K.
- Improving any area of life by just 1/10 of 1% each day (1/1000 overall) can result in doubling your performance and income in under 3 years.  Over 10 years, a 1000% increase is possible.  
- It's never too late to start.  While the earlier the better, starting now is the key.  Every journey starts with small steps.

The compound effect is the unsung hero that can lead to amazing results through small, consistent progress over time.  Though the changes may seem minor and progress slow, the long term rewards can be life-changing.

 

• Your life is the product of your choices and habits. Success and happiness are the results of good habits and choices, while failure and unhappiness are the results of bad habits and choices.

• Habits are behaviors that are repeated regularly and tend to occur unconsciously. Habits form based on your choices and actions, and get stronger over time as you repeat them. Habits can be very hard to break once they become ingrained. 

• 95% of what you do each day is the result of habit. Habits allow us to function without having to consciously think about each little step, which frees up mental capacity. However, bad habits can be destructive if left unchecked.

• To improve your life, focus on developing good habits and breaking bad ones. Make small, sustainable changes and build on them over time through the Compound Effect. Continuous progress and consistency are key.

• You have the power to take control of your habits and choices and steer your life in the direction you want to go. But you have to make the choice to make good choices and build good habits. No one else can do it for you.

• Success comes down to the accumulation of small, continuous improvements and the discipline to make positive choices and repeat good habits each and every day.  Even tiny gains made consistently over time can culminate into massive success and progress.

That's the essence of the advice on habits and success provided in the summary. The key is making continuous progress through small improvements, building good habits, and sustaining them over time through discipline and consistency. Success is a marathon, not a sprint, so focus on the little choices and habits that will get you there in the long run.

 
• Successful and high-achieving people share the common trait of developing good habits and routines. They may have some bad habits, but not many. Their good habits enable them to constantly improve and achieve more.  

• Habits, whether good or bad, become ingrained over time through repetition and practice. Even though we develop most habits unconsciously, we can consciously choose to change them by unlearning bad habits and replacing them with good ones. 

• We often get trapped in bad habits because of our desire for instant gratification. The payoff we get from indulging in a bad habit outweighs the long-term negative consequences in our mind. But over time, those bad habits can compound and lead us far off course from our goals. We need to wake up and realize the impact of our habit choices.

• Willpower alone usually isn’t enough to change bad habits. We need “why-power”—a motivation or purpose that fuels our persistence. When our why is strong enough, we can accomplish almost any “how.” We have to connect our choices to our deepest desires, values and motivations.

• The example of walking across a plank 30 feet up illustrates the power of a strong why. For $20, most people wouldn’t do it because the motivation isn’t enough. But to save a child, the motivation becomes so strong that the how—the difficulty of the task—wouldn’t matter. Our why gives us the power to push through challenges.

• Material motivations and goals aren’t enough to truly drive change. We need to tap into deeper motivations that ignite our passion and creativity. Our why has to resonate with our core purpose and values. When the reason is big enough, we can accomplish amazing things.

 

- Success without fulfillment is failure. It's not enough to choose to be successful, you have to find your deeper motivation or "why-power". 

-Your core values define who you are and what you stand for. They act as your internal compass. Identifying them helps make better decisions and reduces stress.

-People are motivated by either wanting something or not wanting something. Having an "enemy" to fight can be a strong motivator, giving you a reason to stand up and push yourself. Your motivation doesn't have to be noble, as long as its legal and moral. Many successful people used negative experiences as motivation.

-Goals give direction to your motivation and the Compound Effect. Without goals, your efforts will take you somewhere unintended. Setting clear and compelling goals is key to achievement and progress. 

-You only see and experience what you look for. By setting goals, you give your mind something new to focus on and notice. Things that support your goals will seem to appear, not because of magic but because you're now noticing what was always there. Your mind will spot opportunities and tools that can help achieve your goals.  

-Goal setting works by activating your reticular activating system (RAS). This part of your brain filters what you notice based on what's important to you. When you set a goal, your RAS will point out relevant information to help achieve it. This allows you to spot opportunities, tools, and resources you never noticed before.

In summary, find your deeper motivation, set clear goals to direct your effort, and your mind and the world around you will give you the means to achieve them. But you have to take action - goals and motivation themselves don't accomplish anything without action. The Compound Effect comes from relentless action toward your goals each and every day.



• To achieve your goals, you need to develop a clear vision of what you want. Write down your goals and make plans to accomplish them. 
• Successful people have clear, written goals. Unsuccessful people only have vague fantasies.
• Don’t just focus on what you need to do. Focus on who you need to become. Become the kind of person who can achieve your goals. 
• Your habits and behaviors determine your success or failure. Identify any bad habits that are sabotaging you and develop strategies to eliminate them. Also, identify good habits to develop.
• Your life comes down to inputs and outputs. Control your inputs (habits and behaviors) and you’ll control your outputs (results).
• Bad habits are learned and can be unlearned. Use strategies like identifying triggers, finding alternatives, planning, and accountability to break bad habits.
• Replace bad habits with good habits through repetition and consistency. Make new good habits stick through the Compound Effect.

The key strategies for eliminating bad habits are:

1. Identify the triggers that cause your bad habits like the who, what, where and when. Avoid the triggers when possible.
2. Find alternatives to replace your bad habits. Have a plan in place for when the urge hits. 
3. Tell others about your plan to add accountability. Ask them to check-in on your progress. 
4. Make new good habits stick through repetition and consistency. Repeat new behaviors regularly until they become second nature.
5. Use the Compound Effect. Let small, smart choices compound into remarkable results.

If you adopt these strategies and make elimination of your bad habits a priority, you can transform your life for the better. Develop positive new habits and let the Compound Effect work its magic. Success will become something you attract, not pursue.

  of the key points:

• Identify your triggers for bad habits, such as certain people, times of day, emotions, situations, or routines. The more awareness you have, the better equipped you are to change. 

• Remove triggers and enablers from your environment. Throw away junk food, cancel store catalogs, get rid of alcohol or coffee makers—whatever is tempting you.

• Replace bad habits with better alternatives. Have fruit instead of ice cream, crunchy veggies instead of chips, water instead of soda or coffee. Find substitutes that satisfy the underlying need or craving.

• Ease into new habits gradually. For ingrained habits, make incremental changes over weeks or months. Replace caffeinated coffee with half decaf and half regular, then all decaf, then herbal tea. Take it slow.

• Or jump right in. For some people and some habits, immersing yourself in massive lifestyle changes all at once works best. Go cold turkey and make dramatic changes to your diet and exercise habits simultaneously. 

• Run a “vice check” by abstaining from a habit for 30 days. If it’s difficult to give up for a month, that habit has too much control over you and is worth eliminating. Stay in the driver’s seat over your choices and behaviors. 

The key is to become very self-aware about the habits you have and determine which serve you well and which hold you back. Apply different strategies to breaking bad habits and installing good new ones. Take gradual steps or big leaps, depending on what will be most effective for each habit. Stay accountable through vice checks and by cleaning your environment. The more good habits you can install, the more progress you’ll make toward your goals and the life you want.

 

•It takes conscious effort and consistency to develop good habits. You have to plant the seed, water and fertilize it to ensure it takes root. It can take up to a year of daily practice to turn a new habit into an unconscious one. But focusing diligently for the first 3 weeks increases your chances of success. 

•Staying aware is key. Pay attention to your new habit at least once a day to be successful.

•Set yourself up for success. Make sure any new habit fits your lifestyle and schedule. Have the tools and supplies you need on hand. For example, stock your fridge and desk with healthy snacks if you want to eat better. 

•Focus on addition, not subtraction. Instead of thinking of what you're giving up, focus on what you're gaining. For example, think of new hobbies or activities to fill the time previously spent on bad habits.

•Publicly announce your goal. Tell friends and family, post on social media. Knowing others are aware of your goal will make you more accountable. You can also track your progress publicly, like with a calendar.

•Find a success buddy. Team up with someone working toward a similar goal. Check-in regularly, share your progress and roadblocks, and keep each other accountable.

•Make it a competition. Competing with others, even in a friendly way, can boost motivation and drive you to succeed. You can organize competitions and tracking with friends and colleagues. 

•Celebrate small wins. Don't just work hard with no rewards. Give yourself something to look forward to, like a nice meal, massage, or time off to yourself. Celebrate reaching milestones along the way to your ultimate goal.

•Change is difficult, but the rewards are worth it. Successful people take action even when it's hard. If change were easy, the benefits wouldn't be as meaningful. Put in the work, and you'll transform your habits and life.

 

• Extraordinary success requires going beyond what is ordinary or easy. It means persevering in the face of difficulties and challenges. 

• Building new habits and breaking old ones takes time and patience. Our brains form “grooves” or patterns based on repeated thoughts and actions. Forming new grooves requires consistency and repetition. 

• Momentum, or “Big Mo,” is a powerful force that can propel you to success. But momentum works in both directions—it can also perpetuate bad habits and send you into a downward spiral.

• To build positive momentum, you need to make good choices, adopt positive behaviors, establish habits and routines, and stay consistent over time.  

• Examples like Michael Phelps and Apple show how consistency and momentum pay off. Phelps trained for 12 years to prepare for his Olympic success. Apple built momentum over time through customer loyalty, high quality, and simple yet innovative designs. 

• Once you achieve momentum, success builds rapidly through the Compound Effect. But getting started is the hardest part, just like getting a merry-go-round moving or overcoming gravity to launch a rocket. You have to exert a lot of initial effort and energy.

• The key is to start now, keep practicing, stay consistent, and don't stop. Maintain your momentum, and re-boost it when needed, just like giving an occasional push to keep the merry-go-round spinning.

That covers the essence and key highlights from the summary on momentum and the Compound Effect. Let me know if you would like me to explain or expand on any part of the summary.



- Apple’s success with the iPod wasn’t overnight. After releasing the iPod in 2001, Apple experienced negative revenue growth for two years. But in 2003, revenue growth turned positive and accelerated over the next two years. In 2005, Apple’s revenue growth surged to 68% and it gained over 70% of the MP3 player market. This momentum also fueled growth in iPhones, iTunes, and Mac computers. 

- Google and YouTube struggled early on but gained momentum after key events. Google became the dominant search engine after gaining traction. YouTube took off in popularity after a Saturday Night Live video went viral, gaining over 5 million views. Google then bought YouTube for $1.65 billion.

- Success stories like Apple, Google, YouTube, and Michael Phelps show that momentum is built on consistent habits and routines, not overnight success. To build momentum, you need systems of execution and daily disciplines.

- Routines make actions automatic and effective by incorporating them into daily, weekly, and monthly schedules. The more challenging the goal, the more rigorous the routine needs to be. Rigorous routines can transform performance, as seen in military boot camp. 

- Golfer Jack Nicklaus and football kickers have strict pre-shot routines to build consistency and focus. Pilots follow preflight checklists rigorously. Successful people in all fields rely on routines and daily disciplines.

- You can control how your day starts and ends even if you can’t control everything in between. Morning and evening routines bookend your day and set you up for success. For example, the author’s morning routine includes expressing gratitude, sending love to someone, planning three steps toward his top goal, stretching, reading, working, and reviewing his schedule.

 

The author starts his day with a morning routine which includes reviewing his goals, key objectives and priorities for the day. He limits himself to 3 important tasks for maximum productivity. He then closes email and works on those tasks. The rest of the day is flexible but starting with discipline sets the tone. 

In the evening, he reviews how the day went and how it aligned with his plans. He logs new ideas and insights. He reads inspirational material before bed to prime his mind. Having a routine for the start and end of the day provides bookends of discipline.

The author suggests mixing up routines to avoid plateauing and losing passion or motivation. He sets goals to do small things outside his norm to keep things fresh. Developing new rhythms and momentum is key.

For his goal of improving his marriage, he has weekly, monthly and quarterly rhythms. Friday night is date night. Saturday is family day with no work. Sunday night is relationship review where they discuss how the week went and rate the relationship. Monthly they do memorable experiences together. Quarterly they take a 2-3 day trip. These rhythms build momentum.

To track new habits and rhythms, the author created a “Rhythm Register”. It helps ensure consistency which enables the Compound Effect. But rhythms should be sustainable long-term. Overdoing it at first leads to failure. Find a program you can stick to for life. Consistency over time leads to success.

So in summary, the key points are:

1. Start and end each day with discipline 
2. Mix up your routines to avoid plateauing 
3. Develop rhythms and momentum through consistency
4. Use tools like a Rhythm Register to track habits  
5. Start slowly with changes you can sustain long-term
6. Consistency over time enables the Compound Effect

 

The key message is that consistency and maintaining momentum is critical to success. Many people start new routines or habits with enthusiasm but then slack off, losing their progress. It's important to start slowly and build up gradually, planning a sustainable long-term approach. 

For example, Richard wanted to work out 2 hours a day, 5 days a week to get fit, but that level of commitment would not be sustainable for most people in the long run. It's better to start slowly and build up the habit over time to something you can stick with consistently, like working out 3-4 times a week for 45-60 minutes. Consistency over the long haul is the key.

The analogy of the hand pump is used to illustrate this. When you first start pumping, it takes a lot of effort to prime the pump and get the water flowing. Many people give up too soon. But if you persist, the water starts flowing and it gets easier. However, if you stop pumping for too long, the water drains out and you have to start over with the hard pumping to prime the pump again. Success is all about maintaining momentum through consistent action.

Three kinds of influences affect our consistency and habits:

1. Input - What we feed our mind. We need to be selective about the media and information we consume. "Garbage in, garbage out."

2. Associations - The people we spend time with. We tend to become like the people we associate with, so choose your peer group wisely.

3. Environment - Our surroundings. Set up your environment to support your goals and habits. Make it easy to do the right thing.

The key is to be aware of these influences and actively manage them so they support rather than derail your progress and momentum. Success leaves clues - model the habits and behaviors of those who have already succeeded in your area of interest.

 

- Your brain is programmed to focus on negative and worrisome information as a survival mechanism. Left unchecked, it will dwell on negative input all day and night. 
- You must be proactive in controlling the information you allow into your mind. Garbage in, garbage out. Replace negative input with positive, inspirational input.
- Avoid exposure to irrelevant and unproductive information as much as possible. Limit time watching TV, listening to news radio, reading newspapers. Put yourself on an "information diet".
- Replace the time spent consuming irrelevant media with instructional and inspirational content. Turn your commute into a "mobile classroom" by listening to audio books and podcasts.
- The media thrives on shock value and predominantly focuses on negative events, giving a skewed perception of the world. Be very selective in what media you consume.
- The author avoids nearly all news media and relies on targeted RSS feeds for relevant industry news. He listens to instructional audio content during his commute instead of radio. 
- You must eliminate negative input and fill your mind with positive input. Replace "dirty water" with "clean water". Positive input fuels positive expectations and results.

In summary, be extremely selective with the information you allow into your mind. Cut out media that promotes a negative worldview or is irrelevant to your goals. Replace with targeted, instructional content that inspires and motivates you. Your mind will mirror the input you provide it, so fill it with "clean water".

 

- Your success in life is determined largely (up to 95%) by the people you surround yourself with, your “reference group.” 
- You tend to become like the people you spend the most time with, adopting their behaviors, attitudes, and habits. Their influence on you is subtle but powerful.
- Evaluate your current associations and categorize them as:

1. Dissociations - People you need to break away from completely due to their negative influence. This is difficult but necessary. 
2. Limited associations - People you can only spend limited time with before their influence becomes too negative. Determine how much you can afford to be influenced by them.
3. Expanded associations - People who have a positive influence and the qualities you want to attain. Spend more time with them, through direct contact, reading their books, listening to them, joining groups they are part of, etc.

- Identify people who represent what you want to achieve and spend time learning from them, through reading, listening, joining groups they are a part of, etc. Their positive influence can transform your life. 
- Find a “peak performance partner” - someone equally committed to self-improvement who can give you honest feedback and support. Build a mutually beneficial relationship with them.

- Continually reevaluate your associations and make changes as needed to ensure the people around you are supporting your vision and goals. Making these changes is challenging but the benefits to your growth and success are huge.

That’s the summary and key takeaways from the advice on associations and their influence. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 

- Finding an accountability partner or mentor can provide honest feedback and help you stay committed to your goals. The author has a weekly call with his friend Landon Taylor where they discuss wins, losses, and progress. This helps keep them accountable. 

- Successful people often hire coaches and mentors to help them improve. Mentorship is a two-way street where both parties can learn from each other. Engaging a mentor does not have to take up a lot of their time. Even short meetings can provide valuable advice.

- Developing a personal board of advisors comprising people you respect can provide useful input and advice. The author reaches out to his advisors once a week to get feedback and share thoughts. This has provided many benefits. Look for positive, successful people to be on your board of advisors.

- Your environment has a significant impact on your success and achieving your dreams. Sometimes you need to remove yourself from your current environment to see your dreams fulfilled, just as a sapling needs more space to become a mighty oak. Creating a positive environment means clearing physical and mental clutter that drains your energy and productivity. 

- You get in life what you tolerate. The standards you set determine how people treat you and the situations you find yourself in. If you tolerate disrespect or being undervalued, that will continue. If you tolerate being in poor health, that will persist. Life organizes around the standards you establish.

The key message is that the people around you and your environment have a powerful influence over your success and progress. Surround yourself with positive individuals, clear away energy-draining clutter, and do not tolerate anything that will limit your growth. Continually raise your standards and life will rise up to meet them.

 

• Some people blame others for their circumstances but you have control over how people treat you. Protect yourself from negative influences so you can live in peace. 

• Develop structure and routines to accelerate your progress. Surround yourself with a supportive environment to perform at high levels.

• Choose mentors and accountability partners to help you improve key areas of your life. Read books and listen to audios from experts.

• Pushing through difficulties defines your character and accelerates your growth. Recognize that moments of struggle are opportunities to get ahead of your competition.  

• Expect to hit walls and want to give up. But continue taking action and you will breakthrough to higher levels of success faster than expected. Do more than is expected to compound your progress.  

• Conditions are easiest when everything is going well for everyone. Real progress happens when you overcome struggles and temptations that stop others. Wish to improve yourself rather than wish difficulties were easier.

• Simple disciplines and actions compound over time for amazing results. You can speed up your progress by accelerating and multiplying your actions and results. Do more and get greater outcomes with a little more effort.

• Take advantage of opportunities to accelerate your success. Do more than expected and push through difficulties to separate yourself from the herd. Develop the ability to endure hardships better than others. Victory comes from extra effort after giving your all.

  of the key points:

•Doing a little bit more than expected can multiply your results exponentially. Pushing past your limits and beyond what others expect of you compounds your efforts. 

•Arnold Schwarzenegger promoted the “cheating principle” - doing a few extra reps with improper form or assistance after reaching your max. This significantly improves results. Runners can go a little farther than planned for multiplied impact.

•Stuart Johnson took a risk acquiring SUCCESS but then also launched a nonprofit foundation to distribute free books to teens. This exceeded expectations and showed real commitment. 

•In all areas of life, we can do more than expected when we hit our limit. A little extra effort goes a long way. Make calls, serve customers, recognize your team, spend time with family, work out - whatever it is, do more than expected.

•Being a contrarian and doing the unexpected helps you stand out. Send Thanksgiving instead of Christmas cards. Handwrite personal notes instead of generic greetings. Richard Branson is known for splashy, bold product launches and stunts.  The extra wow factor multiplies the impact.

•Often the extra effort doesn’t cost much more but makes a statement. Showing up in person to hand someone an “SOLD” sign when everyone else just calls on the phone is an example.
