 Here is a summary:

- Influencer marketing has become huge as consumers spend more time online and less on traditional media. Top YouTubers and Instagrammers can make millions per year. 
- Even with a small following, you can make decent money as an influencer. The median salary in the US is $51K, and you can make that much or more building an audience around your interests or passion.
- In the past, opportunities were limited for models, actors, etc. But now anyone can build an audience and work with brands. Beautiful or charismatic people don't have to model or act to make money from their looks or personality. 
- An influencer is someone with a big enough social media following that brands will pay them to promote products or services. But you don't have to rely just on promoting other brands' products. You can build valuable content and a personal brand to become an influencer.
- Your personal brand and influence can extend beyond any one platform, topic, or product. Look at examples like Julie Andrews, Oprah, Muhammad Ali, and The Rock. They are known for certain talents or skills but have built brands that transcend those. 
- To build a strong personal brand and become an influencer, you need a phenomenal talent, skill, or passion and the ability to create valuable content and build an audience around that. But you no longer need agents or contracts to find success. You can build a huge following on your own through social media and online content.

- Brian Wampler dove deep into learning electronics through reading and experimenting every night for years. 
- He would work all day, spend time with family, then study electronics until 3 or 4 am, sometimes all night.
- In online electronics forums, laypeople with little experience would ask questions that engineers would answer in very technical terms. When asked to simplify, they would often scoff. 
- Having once been a beginner, Wampler made sure to explain electronics concepts in an easy-to-understand way. He took the same approach with wine.
- Wampler started selling modified guitar pedals online, leading to many customer questions and a need to publish e-books. He then sold DIY kits and custom pedals. Demand grew, and he quit his job to focus on the business.
- Reading "Crush It!" in 2010 caused Wampler to change his approach. He embraced his strengths (designing, content, customer interaction), outsourced other tasks, and focused on new products bearing his name. 
- He shared his authentic self in videos, connecting with customers. He focused on value over volume. He insisted employees represent the brand well. He worked hard following his passion.
- Success requires patience and saying no. Wampler lived simply, putting money back into the growing business. He says to "eat shit for as long as you have to" - put customers and employees first, work hard, sacrifice. Build slowly, methodically.  
- Alex "Nemo" Hanse founded the clothing company Foolies Limited. Customers gave him money for his 30th birthday to attend an event to network. 
- Hanse had an entrepreneurial spirit from a young age, selling snacks and working to earn money. In college, he wanted to create a rapper brand and catchphrase, coming up with "Foolies" to mean someone dumb enough to figure something out.
- Unable to find work after graduating in 2009, Hanse made and sold T-shirts to pay bills. A shirt featuring successful black women became popular, gaining media attention. He grew sales through social media. 
- Hanse believes in working hard, having faith in your ideas, and controlling your brand's message. He continues improving his business knowledge and products to build something lasting. Hard work and patience have been key.

 

- Alex kept working on his music while working at an AT&T store. He and his friend Billy decided that rappers needed their own clothing line but had no money. 
- They put the word "FOOLIES" on a dirty white t-shirt and took pictures of different people wearing it to make it seem popular on social media. This helped market Alex's music and the t-shirts became the main focus of the business.
- Alex found creative ways to provide a special experience for customers like sending them a video of him singing their name or packing t-shirts in mini paint cans with a handwritten note and dream journal. Customers would post about these experiences on social media. 
- The business struggled as Alex worked other jobs but he was inspired by the book Crush It! to create more content. He made a motivational graphic celebrating black female powerhouses in entertainment. 
- The graphic went viral and they turned it into a t-shirt. Then Essence magazine asked for t-shirts on short notice for a youth choir to wear at an event. They got the t-shirts printed just in time and found out the event was sponsored by OWN - the Oprah Winfrey Network. 
- Although their logo was on the back of the t-shirts, not the front, the exposure from the event and promotion on social media by influencers like Shonda Rhimes greatly increased their popularity. 
- Alex has committed to motivating people through more than just t-shirts. He started a podcast called Dream Without Limits Radio to share stories of dreamers and game changers. Although the audience is not huge, the impact on listeners is meaningful. 
- Alex continues to mentor youth and speak at schools about entrepreneurship. His former mentees say his brand's success makes sense given his passion for motivating and empowering others.
- Alex believes speed and efficiency are key to success but patience is also important for long term goals. He learns from failures and mistakes and moves on quickly. Confidence comes from learning through action, not agonizing over decisions. It's better to try and fail than not try at all.

But following your passions and involving your family can make the work rewarding. With enough perseverance and the right mindset (inspired by others like Gary Vaynerchuk), people from any background can achieve great things.

 Here is a summary:

You have to decide how to allocate your time based on your obligations and goals. If you want to achieve a lot, you need to be relentless and work hard for 12-15 hours a day creating content, engaging with your audience, and networking. However, this work ethic and ambition level is not for everyone. You need to determine what level of success and work-life balance is right for you based on your self-awareness. The amount of effort you put into something will determine your results. 

Deon Graham built a successful career in digital marketing by focusing on building his personal brand. He started a website marketing nightclubs that catered to an urban audience. At first, he was just trying to make money quickly, but then he shifted to building his brand for the long-term. He doubled down on engaging with his audience on social media. His platform became hugely popular, leading to work with major alcohol brands and an eventual job as the Digital Director for Sean “Diddy” Combs’ companies. Graham has faced challenges as a young Black man in the corporate world, but has persevered through commitment and hard work.

To achieve success as an influencer, you need to pay close attention to where the attention is focused - trends, controversies, and new popular platforms. Being willing to take risks and try new platforms has allowed influencers to find new audiences. However, you also need to avoid clinging onto platforms once they become ineffective or overcrowded. Continually experimenting and adapting to changes in attention and technology is key. Many influencers missed opportunities by being slow to adapt to new platforms like Instagram. Constant adaptation and an ability to spot undervalued attention sources are crucial skills.

The summary highlights the key ideas around working hard and strategically to build your influence, personal brand, and business. It emphasizes paying close attention to your audience and where attention is focused, taking risks on new platforms, and continually experimenting and adapting to change. The example of Deon Graham brings these ideas to life with a story of how dedication and grit helped him overcome challenges to achieve success.

 Here is a summary:

Andrew went to college in Hampton, Virginia to become a pharmacist. He struggled in his classes and switched to an MBA program without telling his parents. When they found out, they were angry and said he could get an MBA cheaper in their home state of Maryland. 

Andrew wanted to stay at his school because he was building businesses there. He learned to cut hair from his father and started giving haircuts to make money. He also became a DJ and eventually built that into a six-figure business.

Andrew lived in his car for a while and worked in the campus cafeteria for access to food. He joined the Marine Corps Reserves to help pay for school. His DJ brand became successful, so he didn’t need to cut hair anymore. But the experience of homelessness made him want to build financial security.

He took a job in sales and marketing at Pepsi and started his own marketing agency called the O Agency. To prove himself, he helped his friend Bakari Taylor market a training program called Body by Bakari. The marketing campaign was successful but grueling. After a year, Andrew quit his DJ business and Pepsi job. Within six months, the O Agency had an NFL client.

Andrew recently started focusing on his personal brand, @BrandwithDrew. He wants to help people, especially minorities and millennials, build their brands. He enjoys speaking, writing, and creating events to help others. Money is not his top priority.

Andrew says passion and expertise are key to a strong personal brand. You need high-quality, tailored content for each platform. Focus on creating pillar content that can be adapted into many forms of microcontent for different platforms. Your content must be amazing and provide unique value. Build your knowledge and develop a memorable style.

 Here is a summary:

- Do not wait to become an expert or have a perfect product before starting your business. Instead, document your learning process and share it with your audience. Let people see your journey and watch you develop your skills and expertise over time. 

-You have a unique story and perspective to share. Do not worry about creating the perfect blog post or video. Simply share your truth and document your actual life. Let your audience get to know the real you.

- Documenting your life and sharing it with your audience is an easy way to build credibility and connect with people, even when you have little experience. People will see your hustle and passion, and some will find value and inspiration in the everyday moments you share.

- Use social platforms like Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube and Facebook Live to share moments from your day multiple times a day. Share details both big and small to give people an inside look at your life and work. Think of yourself as the star of your own reality show. 

- While documenting your life is an easy way to build an audience and credibility, your content still needs to be high quality. Mediocre content will only produce mediocre results. Study other personal brands and work to consistently improve your content over time. 

- Documenting your journey forces you to be authentic and honest. Do not call yourself an “expert” until you have truly earned the right to that title through dedication and hard work. Share your progress, mistakes and lessons with your audience as you work to gain experience and expertise.

- The ability to look back on your journey and see how far you’ve come is invaluable. Imagine being able to see the early stages of your learning and progress, and then compare it to where you are now. Sharing this progress with your audience allows them to learn from your experiences. 

- Think of documenting your journey as a long-term play. While you may not seem that interesting now, the ability for people to see your progress and development over the course of 5, 10 or 20 years is powerful. Your journey has the potential to inspire others who are just starting out.

 Here is a summary of Lucas’s thoughts as he developed ideas for his student films at USC:

- Lucas was excited to document his creative journey as it unfolded. He felt this would allow him to look back on his progress and see how far he had come. It would also give him material to share with others and build credibility. 

- Lucas believed that in the modern world of the internet, there was no need to “fake it till you make it.” You could put your work out into the world, get feedback, learn and improve. The internet allowed direct access to audiences without needing gatekeepers. 

- Lucas felt it was better to be open about being a novice, as that authenticity and enthusiasm could be attractive. Documenting the journey could also help combat the myth of the “overnight success.” People could see all the work that went into eventual success.

- Lucas believed in continuously producing work and improving. He felt there was always something new to create and share, and the only way to succeed was by being authentic. 

- Lucas acknowledged natural talent only took you so far. Success required continuous hard work and improving your craft, though he cautioned against being a perfectionist. 

- Lucas pointed to well-known successful people as examples, noting there was a time when even huge stars had to use their full names. Success is a journey. 

- Lucas summarized his view that you should create work, share it publicly, get feedback and keep improving. Don't judge your work, let the audience decide if it's good. Keep producing and developing your voice and persona. Authenticity and hard work were the paths to success.

- An anecdote about Rich Roll's journey to becoming an ultra-endurance athlete and wellness advocate illustrated these principles in action. Through documenting his progress, authenticity and continuous self-improvement, Roll found great success and fulfillment.

 

- Rich Roll was a lawyer who became interested in endurance athletics and sharing his experiences on social media. 
- He started posting short videos and updates about his training and diet on YouTube and built up a small following. 
- Reading Gary Vaynerchuk's book Crush It! validated Rich's interest in social media and inspired him to create valuable content for his followers.
- Rich didn't focus on growing his following as much as engaging deeply with the followers he had. He provided them useful information and entertainment.
- In 2010, Rich completed five Ironman triathlons in seven days. His social media following grew, and he was offered opportunities to monetize his popularity.
- He wrote a cookbook and then a memoir, Finding Ultra, which allowed him to quit practicing law. However, the transition was difficult, and his family struggled financially for a few years. 
- Rich started a popular podcast, The Rich Roll Podcast, though it took time to become profitable. His wife supported him through the difficult times.
- Rich's popularity and success grew over time. He's now considered an influential person in health and wellness circles. Though the path was hard, he's grateful he pursued his passion.
- The keys to Rich's success were:
   - Developing a small but engaged social media following by providing value.
   - Having patience and faith that the effort would pay off over the long run. 
   - Persisting through difficulty and not giving up, with the support of his family.
   - Monetizing his platform and popularity through books, speaking engagements, and podcasting.
   - Maintaining his passion for creating content and serving his audience.

 

- The key message is about transforming yourself and tapping into your potential. The author completed extreme physical feats at age 44 to demonstrate this.

- There are many excuses people give for not pursuing their goals like lack of time, money, experience, family responsibilities, fear of failure, etc. But the author says these are excuses and people can overcome them with determination and hard work. 

- There are three main fears that hold people back:

1. Fear of failure and being judged by others. The author says you have to ignore negative opinions and push through, even if it means having difficult conversations with friends and family. Failure is inevitable but you can recover and ultimately succeed. 

2. Fear of the unknown. The author says do extensive planning and preparation to feel more in control and confident. Be flexible as things change.

3. Fear of hard work. The author says there are no shortcuts. Be ready to work harder than you ever have. With determination, you can achieve goals that once seemed impossible.

- The story of Rodrigo Tasca illustrates overcoming fears and excuses. He moved back in with his parents at age 31 to save money, even though it was hard on his image and dating life. But he knew it was necessary to build his business. He feels sorry for friends stuck in jobs they hate because they are afraid to take risks. He had to start over at zero but is now happy and building something bigger.

- In summary, the key is to face your fears, ignore the naysayers, and work hard to achieve your dreams. Be flexible and persevere. Have the courage to transform yourself and tap into your potential.

 

- Rodrigo started out working in his family's restaurant business and then for a large corporation. 

- About 7 years ago, he won a GoPro at a company party which sparked an interest in filming and making videos.

- He traveled to Peru for 7 months to film real estate properties for a friend. When he returned to the US, he had various jobs including working as a personal chef.

- He discovered the book Crush It! which inspired him to pursue his passion for filming. He took many online classes and offered his services for free to gain experience.

- He moved to Florida to create a market for filming small business videos but initially struggled as he had to rebrand and adjust his strategy. Within a year, his business grew substantially. 

- He now charges $1,200 per day for filming and has traveled for work. He lives with his supportive family.

- His fears of "wasting time" in pursuing his passion were unfounded as he gave up only his downtime, not valuable time. The risk was worth it for the opportunity to build a fulfilling business.

- The story of Sean O'Shea is provided as an example. He worked as a valet for 11 years while playing music. His break came when he got two puppies that became aggressive and dangerous due to his lack of training. 

- He studied dog training and made personal improvements. He built a successful dog training business, The Good Dog, and has trained over 1,000 dogs. His story shows that it's never too late to pursue your passion.

 

As a young adult, Sean studied and worked hard to build his dog training business. He started by training his own unruly dogs using balanced training techniques. His success with his own dogs led neighbors to ask him to train their dogs too. He soon started a dog walking business on the side of his job as a valet and musician. The business quickly grew, and within a few years, he was making over $100K per year training and walking dogs. 

Though Sean didn't have a background in business, he educated himself by reading books on marketing and social media. He started creating videos, blog posts, and social media content to build his audience. His authenticity and transparency about his own struggles resonated with people. He worked tirelessly, posting new content daily and responding to his community.

Sean's business continued to grow through social media and word-of-mouth. He now has two locations, a staff of trainers, and an international audience. He makes over $600K per year from his training, products, sponsorships, and speaking engagements. Though Sean works long hours creating content and managing the business, he feels motivated to make the most of his opportunity after struggling for years to find his purpose.

Sean's story is an inspiration, showing what's possible with hard work, persistence, and caring deeply about your audience and customer experience. His enthusiasm and eagerness to help others is a model for success in today's world. Though building a personal brand and business seems daunting, Sean's story proves that by jumping in, working hard, and believing in yourself, you can achieve great things. The resources and opportunities are out there; you just have to start.

 Here is a summary:

Mimi G started sewing at a young age, learning from her mother. Though her first attempt at making her mother a dress was disastrous, it planted the seed of her interest in fashion design.  Due to troubles at home, Mimi ran away as a teen and ended up homeless for a while. After becoming a teen mom, she moved in with friends and eventually got her own place, though she struggled financially. 

A boss noticed her talent for sewing and gave her $30,000 to start a fashion line. Though she enjoyed the design aspect, she didn't like the business side. She started a blog in 2012 to teach people how to sew high-end fashions. It became popular and led to many requests for her to make and sell skirts. Though she initially refused, she took a few orders around Christmas and ended up with more than she could handle. She then focused on teaching people how to make the skirts themselves through video tutorials.

Her blog and business grew quickly, allowing her to quit her job in two years. She realized her blog provided motivation and inspiration for many people going through difficult times. A friend recommended the book Crush It!, which inspired her to further build her community and engage with her followers. For example, she hosted an in-person event that led to an annual conference. 

Mimi's biggest moment was being asked to appear on and mentor contestants for Project Runway Junior. She noticed a lack of diversity in the sewing industry and started a digital magazine called Sew Sew Def to feature makers from diverse backgrounds. She believes the more she helps others, the more she benefits in return. She aims to bring more diversity and representation to the brands she works with.

In summary, Mimi turned her passion for sewing and talent for design into a successful business and brand. Though she faced many hardships, she persevered and built an inspiring community that provides her fulfillment and purpose. Her next goal is to increase diversity and representation in the sewing industry.

 

Pat, an architect, had a promising career and was engaged to be married in March 2008. However, three months later, he lost his job during the financial crisis, along with millions of others. Though he had recently earned a difficult professional credential, the LEED AP, it did not help him find a new job. 

Depressed and living with his parents, Pat stumbled upon a podcast about making money online. He realized he could monetize a website he had created to help people study for the LEED exam. Though nervous, he joined a local "mastermind" group to get advice. They encouraged him to create an ebook to sell on his site. Despite doubts, he did, and it earned $7,908 the first month, more than double his old salary.

By March 2009, Pat's online business was earning $25,000 to $35,000 per month. People asked him how he built his business, so he started SmartPassiveIncome.com to share what he learned. Two events showed this could be a real career:

1) His old boss offered him a higher-paying job to return but Pat quickly said no, realizing he preferred being an entrepreneur.  

2) Reading Crush It! by Gary Vaynerchuk inspired Pat to fully commit to his "worms,"  which were helping people pass the LEED exam. Seeing Vaynerchuk personally respond to readers and offer to chat by phone further motivated Pat.

In summary, after losing his job in 2008, Pat discovered he could build a successful online business. Helping people study for a professional exam he had recently passed himself, his earnings grew quickly. Though initially unsure, two signs convinced him to commit fully to life as an entrepreneur. Pat found motivation in seeing an author directly engage with and support readers.

 Here's a summary of the key points:

- Pat Flynn turned a one-star review of his ebook into an opportunity. He reached out to the reviewer, appreciated their feedback, and ended up turning them into a fan. This strategy of engaging with critics and providing value led to a huge increase in his business and success. 

- Pat committed to being transparent and sharing his journey with his audience. He started various businesses publicly and shared both his successes and failures. This authenticity and willingness to be vulnerable built trust and reciprocity with his followers.

- Facebook is essential for building an influencer brand. Despite targeting younger audiences, you need a Facebook business page to establish your presence. Facebook's investment in video and other features will continue to attract more users of all ages.

- Costa Kapothanasis turned his quick lube business around by pivoting to social media marketing and content creation. After wasting money on ineffective strategies, he devoted his marketing budget to Facebook ads and community building. He engaged with customers on social media, posted photos of their cars, and created educational content. This social strategy led to a huge increase in business and expansion into new locations.

- The key strategies for influencer success are: provide value to your audience, engage with both fans and critics, share authentic stories of both success and failure, establish a presence on Facebook, and devote resources to social media marketing and content creation. Building a genuine connection with your audience and educating them will turn them into lifelong fans and customers.

 Here is a summary:

- The man started with nothing but has found success through building relationships and providing value to others. 

- He believes the two best ways to breakthrough when you have no platform are:

1. Using hashtags strategically over a long period of time. 
2. Direct messaging influencers and offering them something of value in exchange for their attention and collaboration. This also requires consistency and time.

- He shares an example of connecting with new people at a dinner through mutual interests. The same concept applies online - find influencers with shared interests, provide value, and build connections. 

- He acknowledges that influencers likely get hundreds of direct messages per day asking for something. The key is to differentiate yourself by offering real value, not just exposure. Some examples include:

- Free product or service for a period of time 
- Custom content creation (filters, graphics, etc.)
- Access to inventory (if legally allowed)

- Building connections and relationships with influencers by providing value is difficult and time-consuming but worth it. Those who do it will find success. 

- He then discusses Musical.ly, a social media platform focused on short-form video, lip-syncing and more. It has over 200 million users, many of whom are tweens and teens. 

- Musical.ly initially grew slowly but made a few changes including allowing content to be shared on other platforms like Instagram. This led to much faster growth. 

- He believes for Musical.ly to continue growth, it needs to evolve to retain and gain new users. Possible ways include:

- Appealing to older teens as current users age 
- Adapting to competitors also targeting younger users
- Pivoting like Facebook did to mobile 
- Integrating new technology like voice 

- He has found success on Musical.ly by providing value to the audience. Though not the target demographic, he aims to inspire young entrepreneurs. By building an audience now, he may do business with them in the future.

- One of his first Musical.ly campaigns involved posting content featuring wisdom from the hip hop artist Fat Joe to help younger users find his show.

 

• You created short video clips set to music on the app Musical.ly to build an audience. Examples include:
- A clip of you jumping through the ceiling to "All the Way Up" by Fat Joe. 
- A meme about hard work set to "Work" by Rihanna.
- An inspirational video set to "A Sky Full of Stars" by Coldplay.
- A clip remembering how you overcame self-doubt as a kid.

• You collaborated with top Musical.ly users, had them appear on your #AskGaryVee show, and promoted each other to gain new fans.

• You tested many social platforms to find what works, learned from failures, and gained experience that helped you succeed on Vine, Instagram, and Musical.ly. 

• You advise using trending hashtags, collaborating, and creating original content to gain traction on Musical.ly. While big influencers can be expensive, you can find good deals with up-and-coming influencers and through programmatic ads.

• Musical.ly is for performance and non-performance based content. You've made inspirational memes, clips of you speaking Russian, and linked the ALS ice bucket challenge to a Gwen Stefani song. Creativity is key.

• You argue that the most creative content comes from people producing for audiences like themselves. As an "alpha guy," you connect with similar audiences. Anyone can produce creative content on Musical.ly.

• You give an example of becoming a camp director after years as a singer and actor, using your experience to offer more performing arts programs at the camp. You're settling down but not leaving your industry entirely.

 

- The author owns a summer camp that has struggled in recent years due to competition from newer camps. 
- The author's 11-year-old niece shows her an app called Musical.ly where kids post short music videos. 
- The author starts posting music videos on Musical.ly to promote her camp. She lets campers help create content and post their own videos.
- The Musical.ly videos spread awareness of the camp on social media and through word of mouth. Registrations for the camp double. 
- The camp becomes very popular, especially with kids interested in music and performing arts. The author is now able to expand the camp into a year-round school for performing arts.

 

- Snapchat is a popular social media platform with 173 million daily active users. It started as a way to share disappearing photos but now allows sharing of video, filters, lenses, and stories. 

- Snapchat became popular with teens first because it allowed them to communicate in a free, uncurated way away from their parents. Now it's mainstream.

- DJ Khaled helped bring Snapchat into the mainstream in 2015 by sharing inspirational messages and snippets of his life. His authenticity and relatability resonated with fans and helped him build his brand.

- Kerry Robinson and her baby Jayde became famous on Snapchat by sharing cute videos of Jayde playing with Kerry's hair. They now have successful YouTube and Instagram channels, showing how you can build a brand by sharing your ordinary life. 

- Many influencers have now moved from Snapchat to Instagram Stories, but Snapchat helped pioneer the sharing of casual, in-the-moment content. Posting on Snapchat is low pressure because the content disappears, allowing people to experiment and build their brands without fear.

- The takeaway is that mundane details of life are not dumb or worthless. When shared authentically, they can help build connections and even fame. Snapchat makes it easy to share those casual details, even if the content isn't perfectly polished.

 Here is a summary:

• Don’t give up on Snapchat. It serves a different purpose than Instagram and provides a new audience. 

• Snapchat is hard to build a following on, so if you do it well, you’ll stand out. Focus on creating great content.

• Snapchat gives you a chance to show a different side of yourself and break away from the narrative you’ve created on other platforms. Use it to be surprising and authentic.

• Building a brand on Snapchat requires real marketing and branding skill. It’s not just about converting sales or optimizing metrics. It helps you become a better marketer.

• To get started, cross-promote your Snapchat on your other social platforms. Build awareness of your account so people will follow you. 

• Collaborate with other influencers to increase your followers, but you need to offer them something valuable in return, like appearing on their channel. 

• Consider paying for ads that promote your Snapchat or writing blog posts about using Snapchat to establish yourself as an expert. Create events or interactive projects to gain visibility.

• Websites like The11thsecond.com make it easier to find interesting accounts to follow since Snapchat lacks a discovery feature. Submit your info or check out others.

• Use Snapchat to show the small, mundane details of your life and personality. Share things that wouldn’t normally make it to your other platforms. Allow yourself to create a new narrative.

• In summary, don’t dismiss Snapchat. With hard work and the right strategies, you can build your brand and connect with new audiences there. See it as an opportunity, not an obstacle.

 

- Shaun McBride, known as Shonduras, became an influencer on Snapchat. 
- He first started an e-commerce jewelry business that earned $1.2 million in revenue in a year. However, he sold it after 8 months as he got bored.
- He then got a job as a sales rep for skateboard and snowboard brands which allowed him to travel and use Snapchat. 
- He saw potential in Snapchat and set goals to grow an audience and get press coverage.
- To grow his audience, he posted creative and fun content like doodles, drawings, and collaborations with other Snapchatters. He invited fan participation and built community. 
- Though he lacked artistic ability, he taught himself to draw through practice and by looking up tutorials.  His quirky style and humor resonated with fans.
- To get press, he pitched stories about Snapchat to media outlets posing as his mother. His strategy worked and he became the go-to source for information on Snapchat.
- His lighthearted content "gives our followers a chance to see us at our most human." Though the content itself may seem trivial, it served the purpose of building his personal brand and business.

In summary, through ambition, creativity, community building, and persistence, Shaun McBride was able to turn Snapchat into a platform for influence and business. His work epitomizes the message that one can achieve success through passion and hard work.

 Here is a summary:

Shaun McBride, known as Shonduras on social media, built a successful personal brand on Snapchat. He grew up skateboarding in Utah and eventually got a marketing job at a tech company. On the side, though, he spent hours each night using Snapchat to tell short, creative stories and built up a huge following. 

Shaun had three goals to succeed on Snapchat:

1. Build an audience by posting entertaining content consistently. He started gaining more views and followers.

2. Get media attention to raise his profile. He emailed tech media posing as his mom to pitch stories about him. He was featured in major publications like Time and Forbes. 

3. Create content for brands to demonstrate his value. He pitched small companies but his big break came when Disney agreed to let him create a Snapchat story for them promoting their “Show Your Disney Side” campaign. More brand deals followed.

Shaun’s success and fame grew over the years through hard work and strong relationships. He kept improving his content and expanding to other platforms like YouTube while still engaging audiences on Snapchat. He worked as an influencer, content creator, consultant, and public speaker. He attributes his success to building genuine connections, providing value, and saying “yes” to new opportunities.

Though Snapchat’s future is uncertain, Shaun McBride built a personal brand that has endured by adaptating to changes in technology and social media. His positivity, storytelling skills, and entrepreneurial spirit have allowed him to turn a side hobby into a thriving business.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

• Twitter is a comprehensive and reliable directory with a strong verification and search system. It’s easier to determine if accounts are authentic compared to other platforms like Instagram. 

• The retweet feature on Twitter enables instant awareness and virality. Content can spread quickly through word-of-mouth, in a way that’s not possible on Instagram or Snapchat. 

• You can post more frequently on Twitter, up to dozens of times a day. This allows for more storytelling and opportunities to be noticed. Engaging with others leads to growing your influence and opportunities.

• Anyone can start a conversation on Twitter and become part of the discussion around trending topics or events. This allows you to build your personal brand and voice. Repeatedly engaging over time can lead to career opportunities.

• The example shows how consistently engaging on Twitter over the long run by posting and commenting for multiple hours a day can eventually lead to getting discovered and career opportunities, even if it takes a year or more. Short-term intense effort and persistence pay off.

• The advice is aimed at people who are not fully satisfied and want to improve their lives. While the example recommends an intensive workload, the overall message is about pursuing work you find meaningful and impactful. Some sacrifice of work-life balance may be needed to build a new career or business. But the reward is having more time spent on enjoyable and fulfilling work.

• The profile of Jared Polin shows how he built a successful YouTube channel and business by focusing on his passion for photography and providing helpful content to others. After struggling for years to gain traction, his persistence and honesty eventually paid off. His story emphasizes following your passions and not giving up.

 Here is a summary:

- At the time, most experts recommended using blogs to build an audience. However, the person in the story did not consider himself a writer. 
- He watched other photographers' YouTube channels but was unimpressed with the information they provided. Rather than criticize them, he decided to do better.
- He attended an event where he heard a wine salesman say that he used video to grow his family's business. The salesman said the keys to success were: 1) being good at what you do; 2) being passionate about it; and 3) working hard. This resonated with him. 
- His mother's death motivated him to share his knowledge so others could benefit. He maxed out a $15,000 credit card to buy equipment and start creating content.
- For two years, he posted a video every day, interacting with viewers and answering questions. His viewership grew to 100, then 200 views. He made connections to appear on other channels. 
- Brands like Nikon and Canon started asking him to review their products. He was upfront that he would provide honest reviews. His credibility and free model allowed him to barter with bands for access to create more content.
- In 7 years, he posted 2,400 videos and received 100 million views. He made $80,000 in the first two years and now makes seven figures. His key message is that success requires hard work and persistence. 
- The story notes that YouTube has created many opportunities. The person made a mistake early on by choosing to focus on Viddler over YouTube, though his advice would have been the same. YouTube reaches more 18-49-year-olds than TV. 
- The story encourages the reader to try YouTube. While many don't see themselves as video material, YouTube has vloggers of all types. Vlogging allows you to document instead of create, so anyone can do it. Interesting content is subjective. Videos on topics like garage sales get many views. 
- Vlogging is an equalizer. YouTube is where people who were underestimated can succeed. It helps you find your skills and interests. Pick up your phone, document your day, and post daily vlogs to see what resonates.

 

- The author started filming a wine review show for YouTube without overthinking it or worrying about quality. Over time, the show evolved as the author got more comfortable being himself on camera and gained feedback from the audience. 

- The key is not to aim for perfection and not to give up too quickly. Give yourself time to adjust and improve. If you start creating content, you'll either find success, realize you're not cut out for it and move on, or you'll pivot into related opportunities. The only way to know your potential is to try.

- While competition has increased significantly since the early days of YouTube, talent, creativity, and persistence can still lead to success. Traditional media opportunities are also possible on YouTube. With time and experience, the quality and content of videos can improve dramatically.

- The author shares a hypothetical example of "Sam," a 52-year-old insurance salesperson. After realizing he potentially has 30-40 more active years of life left after his kids move out, Sam decides to pursue hobbies and interests he let go of, like dance. He pitches the idea of getting back in shape and filming the entire process to his partner. The goal is to hold themselves accountable while also potentially gaining a following on YouTube. 

- The key message is that it's never too late to pursue your passions and that documenting your journey on YouTube, while starting imperfectly, can lead to new opportunities and life adventures. The platform allows anyone to achieve success and happiness through creating and sharing video content.

 

- The author used to work as a pharmaceutical sales rep but always wanted to be an entrepreneur. He tried various side hustles over the years but they failed. 
- He started posting videos of his family on YouTube to share with relatives. He monetized the videos with Google Ads but made no money.
- For a science project, his son Lincoln wanted to cut open sports balls to see what's inside. They filmed the process and posted the video on YouTube, renaming the channel Lincoln Markham. 
- Nearly a year later, the video started gaining views and earning money. YouTube had started suggesting it when people searched for baseball videos.
- Seeing the success, they decided to focus on the channel. They hid the other videos, renamed the channel What's Inside, and started cutting open more items to film. 
- They spent 4-5 hours every Saturday filming and Dan would upload one new video per week. The quality improved over time as they learned how YouTube's algorithm worked.
- After 2 years, the channel had over 2 million subscribers and 200 million views. They were making over $20,000 per month, allowing Dan to quit his job.
- Their success came from high quality content, keyword optimization, consistency, and always improving and learning. Engaging with viewers and building a community was also key.
- The story shows that "overnight success" often comes only after years of work and failing at other attempts. But with persistence, you can achieve great things.

The key points are: high quality and consistent content, optimizing for YouTube's algorithm, continuously improving, building a community, and persistence over a long period of time. An "overnight success" is usually the result of years of work and failing before finally succeeding.

 Here is a summary:

- Dan Markham taught himself how to use Final Cut Pro to edit videos for their YouTube channel, What's Inside. He enhanced the storytelling of the videos by adding footage of related activities, like throwing a football before cutting one open.

- Dan and his son Lincoln learned more about YouTube and building an audience by attending conferences and networking with other YouTubers. At one conference, they learned that YouTubers make most of their money from sponsored content and brand deals, not AdSense revenue.

- In 2015, Dan started pitching brands on FameBit and got their first deals to cut open products like Rubik's Cubes and mattresses for a few hundred to a thousand dollars. A few months later, they started pitching bigger brands and ad agencies. 

- Their first big brand deal was with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Dan and Lincoln created a video about bringing clean water to developing countries. The deal showed them they needed to work with brands they genuinely supported. 

- In 2016, their video cutting open a rattlesnake rattle went viral and gained over 40 million views in a week. The video exposed them to new audiences and big brands started approaching them with deals.

- Dan quit his sales job in July 2016 to focus on YouTube full time. His family was initially worried but became supportive. Dan is careful to protect Lincoln's childhood and not make YouTube feel like a job for him. 

- Big brands like Nike now see Lincoln as an influencer, though Dan questions whether that's accurate. The experiences they've had, like meeting Bill Gates, have been life-changing regardless of the money. 

- Dan says success requires consistent hard work and trying new things. He never expected cutting things open would take off, but years of effort allowed the opportunity. 

- Facebook remains crucial for building a personal brand because of its enormous audience, flexibility, and sharing culture. Content that works on other platforms can be shared and promoted on Facebook.

 Here is a summary:

Facebook is an effective platform for personal branding and growing an audience. Some key reasons are:

- It has a huge reach (2 billion monthly users) and highly targeted ads. This allows even those with small budgets to reach their target audience.
- Its native content gets high visibility. Posts, videos and Facebook Live broadcasts designed specifically for the platform tend to get more reach. 
- It fosters engagement and sharing. With the right content, posts can spread widely through shares and build brand awareness. 
- It is suited for marketing, sales and branding. Facebook combines these elements, and is currently underpriced. 

Some tips for using Facebook effectively:

- Focus on high-quality, engaging content. Content should be visual, have an engaging first 3 seconds, show understanding of the audience, and compel sharing. 
- Consider Facebook Live, but only if you have experience. Live video is difficult, but can capture spontaneous moments. It may not be ideal for beginners.
- Collaborate with influential pages in your niche. Offer them great content to share to quickly build your audience. 
- Be consistent and post frequently. While quality matters most, more posts mean more opportunities for engagement and shares. A weekly or biweekly schedule is good.

The example illustrates these points through a fictional real estate agent, Sally. Some suggestions for her include:

- Create a weekly podcast discussing life in Sacramento. This establishes her as an expert on the city. 
- Promote the podcast through Facebook, using video clips, images and text. Engage the audience in discussions about topics covered. 
- Reach out to popular local pages to share content from the podcast. This cross-promotion will expand her audience.
- Over time, the podcast and Facebook presence will build her brand as the "virtual-content mayor" of Sacramento.

In summary, Facebook should be a key part of any personal branding strategy. With the right content and techniques, it offers an affordable way to raise brand visibility and connect with your target audience.

 Here is a summary:

- Brittney Castro is a financial advisor who has built a successful personal brand in her industry. 
- Originally, she wanted to be an event planner but her career counselor suggested she try finance, since it also involved helping people. She worked at a corporate firm for 5 years but didn't like the environment.
- During the recession, she started reading personal development books and realized she could build a brand in finance to have more freedom and authenticity. She saw other women building YouTube channels and thought she could do the same in finance, aiming to become like Suze Orman for a younger generation.
- It took time for her to develop her own voice and become comfortable being authentic online in a professional way. She read many marketing and branding books, including Crush It!.
- In 2011, she launched a blog, Facebook page, YouTube channel and Twitter to teach finance concepts online. Although it required approval at her firm, it taught her to be thoughtful with her content.  
- 2.5 years later, she started her own business, Financially Wise Women, focused on women and couples in their 30s and 40s. Her peers disapproved but that affirmed she was on the right path.

- Key points: Building a personal brand requires authenticity, consistency and patience. Start with your strengths and interests, then adapt the medium to your industry. Look for role models but aim to serve an underserved niche. Don't let naysayers stop you - use their doubt as motivation. With time and practice, you can develop your voice and become comfortable being authentic in a professional way.

 Here is a summary:

- In 2015, she launched a finance rap video on YouTube which received criticism from other financial advisors for being unprofessional. However, she ignored the criticism because the video was meant to educate urban teenagers in a fun way, not traditional clients. 

- Today, she frequently uses Facebook Live to connect with her audience by answering their questions in real time. She has done Facebook Live sessions on her own page as well as with brand partners like Chase and Entrepreneur. She hopes to one day create her own online video show.

- Although she receives criticism from others in her industry, she is in high demand as a consultant to other firms and advisors interested in learning social media and branding best practices. She also speaks at many events. Otherwise, she focuses on growing her own company rather than paying attention to her competitors.

- The author admires her the most out of all the contributors because she proves that strict industry regulations do not have to hold you back if you put in the effort to navigate them properly. Her success shows that you can thrive without fear when you understand the rules.

- Instagram is a huge platform that has created many influencers and celebrities. Although curated, the addition of Stories made it a place for more casual content as well. The author recommends using it for building a personal brand.

- The author provides 7 steps for business development on Instagram:

1. Post high-quality content 
2. Search relevant hashtags
3. Click on popular hashtags 
4. Click on posts with those hashtags
5. Investigate accounts that posted them
6. Send direct messages to relevant accounts 
7. Explain why you're messaging them and how you can provide value

- The author uses the example of a clothing store manager named Rick to illustrate how to leverage Instagram for business. Rick posts photos of products, employees, customers, and himself in store clothing. He uses relevant hashtags to increase visibility and build an audience.

 Here is a summary:

- To gain followers and build a brand on Instagram, use relevant hashtags on your posts. Engage with local influencers and followers by direct messaging them and offering discounts or invites to events. Build relationships and provide great customer service. 

- Brittany Xavier started an Instagram and blog as a hobby to document her life and make some money from affiliate links. She charged brands to feature their products and increased her rates over time as she gained more followers and experience. She quit her job to focus on her influencer work full-time.

- Xavier travels frequently for sponsored work and brand deals. She uses these opportunities to also produce travel content for her followers. She has developed relationships with many hotel brands and often receives free stays. She is invited to many brand events to help promote new products or locations.

- Xavier's husband Anthony also quit his job to work with her. They try to complete most of their work during the day so they can spend time with their daughter Jadyn after school. Sometimes Jadyn will appear in sponsored posts, for which Xavier charges a higher rate. Xavier puts some of this money into an account to teach Jadyn financial literacy. 

- Although the work can be demanding, Xavier turns down some opportunities to spend time with her family. She turned down a high-paying brand deal to chaperone a school trip with her daughter. Her daughter helps keep her focused on work-life balance.  

- The overall message is that by building an engaged following, creating relationships, and maintaining your priorities, you can turn an Instagram hobby into a successful business and career as an influencer. But you have to be strategic and willing to sacrifice some opportunities to focus on what really matters to you.

 Here is a summary:

- Xavier, a lifestyle blogger, says that while the blogosphere is competitive, unique and consistent bloggers can still succeed. Brands are investing more in influencer marketing and paying attention to conversion rates from blogs. 
- Xavier worked nights and weekends for a year before making any money from her blog. She says you have to be passionate to succeed as a blogger. 
- Podcasts are appealing because people don’t have to appear on camera and they allow for multitasking. Podcast listenership has grown a lot. 
- The author started a podcast in 2014 but recently rebranded it and varied the content, helping its popularity increase. Podcasts themselves don’t offer many options for building a personal brand, so promotion on other channels is important. New podcast analytics will help creators see how people engage with their content.
- The author presents a fictional example of two older women, Blanche and Judy, who start a successful movie review podcast. Their friendship and humor make the podcast appealing, and they are able to turn it into a business that supports them financially. 
- John Lee Dumas felt unfulfilled in a corporate job and started the Entrepreneurs on Fire podcast. He left his job at 32 to start the podcast and built it into a seven-figure business in just over two years.

The key messages are:

1) Podcasting can be an appealing format for building an audience and business. 
2) Passion and consistency are required to succeed with podcasting and blogging. 
3) While competitive, blogs and podcasts that offer something unique still have the potential to stand out and gain popularity. 
4) Podcasts and blogs can be turned into substantial businesses, though it often takes time to gain traction and financial success. 
5) Dissatisfaction with traditional careers has motivated some successful podcasters and bloggers to pursue their own path.

 Here is a summary:

- The man had served in the military on active duty before becoming a civilian again. He then tried law school but dropped out. He worked in corporate finance for a few years but didn't want the jobs above him. He felt destined to be an entrepreneur but didn't know how. 
- In 2009, he read the book Crush It! which inspired him to quit his job, move to San Diego, and become a real estate agent. He did that for 3 years but still didn't feel fulfilled. 
- He re-read Crush It! in 2012 and realized he needed to build a personal brand. He started using social media for his business. He also discovered podcasts, became an avid listener and noticed there weren't any daily shows interviewing entrepreneurs. 
- He launched his own daily podcast in September 2012 called Entrepreneurs on Fire. Within 2.5 months, it had over 100,000 downloads. He got invitations to conferences and was able to get big name guests. 
- He asked his audience what they wanted and used their feedback to monetize his show. He now makes $200K to $300K a month from his various revenue streams. 
- He continues to read Crush It! every year. The key takeaway for him is to look for new opportunities and not miss the chance to "landgrab" the next big thing, like he did with podcasting. New channels are always emerging, like Snapchat, Instagram Stories and Facebook Live. 
- The chapter then shifts to discuss "Voice-First" - using voice assistants like Alexa and voice searches. The author believes this will transform how people consume content. Voice-First allows people to fill short periods of time that used to be lost. In 2016, 20% of Google searches on mobile were by voice. The author thinks that number will rise quickly.

 Here is a summary:

• Voice-first platforms like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant are gaining popularity. Other companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Samsung are developing similar platforms. 

• You can develop “skills” for these platforms that provide short bits of information like news updates, life hacks, guest lists from TV shows, etc. These are called “flash briefings.”

• The key is to keep your content very short, high quality, and tailored specifically for voice. Listeners can easily remove a skill if the content is annoying, low quality, or too long. 

• Voice-first platforms will become increasingly ubiquitous, integrated into more areas of our lives like cars, homes, and how-to guides. Many brands will develop skills and flash briefings to reach consumers.

• Two examples are provided:

1) Marlo, an etiquette coach, develops an Alexa skill called “The Manners Maven” to provide short answers to common etiquette questions. This helps raise brand awareness and directs people to her other content.

2) Johnny, a landscaper, develops 11 different flash briefings with gardening tips tailored to different planting zones in the U.S. One of his flash briefings is featured by Alexa, gaining him more exposure.

• The key takeaway is to start developing skills and flash briefings now to gain valuable real estate and reach consumers before the space becomes too crowded. Early adopters will have an advantage.

 Here’s a summary:

• Amazon is launching a new product called Skills and Flash Briefings. They will run commercials to promote these new  offerings. If your voice is featured in one of these commercials, it could greatly increase your exposure and success, like when Apple featured Feist’s song “1234” in an iPod commercial.

• Now is the time to create a Flash Briefing because the competition is low and the novelty is high. In five years, the opportunity will be gone as the market becomes saturated. Act now to take advantage of this opportunity. 

• Successful Flash Briefings could lead to new business opportunities, like franchising. For example, a landscaping business could make $200,000 a year but then make $25,000 per year in franchising fees from 700 locations, totaling $17.5 million.

• Marlo the Manners Maven should create a Flash Briefing in addition to her Skill. She could record 365 etiquette tips, one for each day of the year. Etiquette is still important, even in the digital age. She should take advantage of this opportunity now before the costs increase.

• Always look ahead to new technologies and platforms. Things like augmented reality, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence will become mainstream in the future. Life-logging, recording and documenting our daily lives, will also become normal and provide new ways of experiencing the lives of loved ones, even those no longer living.

• The passion and vision that led to promoting Twitter and YouTube early on is the same passion leading to promoting Flash Briefings and Skills now. People should experiment with new platforms themselves rather than waiting for recommendations. Look for what’s capturing people’s attention and altering behavior. Execute and take action. Vision and patience are required.

• Andy Frisella, the MFCEO, found success by focusing on serving his customers. His sports nutrition business was stagnant until he made a pivot to focus on helping people achieve their goals. By providing value to customers, his business grew rapidly, doubling annually for five years. Passion for money held him back; passion for creating success stories fueled growth. 

 Here is a summary:

- Andy and Chris increased their advertising and marketing budget for their company 1st Phorm. However, Andy believes that advertising should be used to spread stories about your company and brand that people are already telling. If people are not saying good things about your company, advertising will only speed up the demise of the business. 

- 1st Phorm was founded based on the principles that Andy learned were critical for business success: care about your customers, give them what they want and more, and give them opportunities to share their great experiences with others. They used social media, especially Instagram, Facebook, and podcasting, to build their brand and spread their message.

- Andy and Chris grew 1st Phorm from $1 million to $100 million in sales. Andy predicts they will reach $200 million in 2018. As their success grew, Andy became recognized as an entrepreneur that knew things others didn’t. He began public speaking, writing a book, hosting a podcast called The MFCEO Project, and launching a YouTube channel.

- It took Andy 18 years to achieve the success and recognition he now has. He is envious of younger entrepreneurs today who have never known a world without the Internet and social media. However, he also thinks younger entrepreneurs rely too much on social media and not enough on face-to-face interactions and customer experiences. Success requires a combination of social media savvy and empathy, care, and in-person engagement.

- Andy’s key lessons are: social media equals business; innovation makes people uncomfortable; care deeply about everything but don’t care what others think; there will always be haters; success requires patience, hard work, and persistence. He wants to inspire others to find their courage and pursue their dreams. Success will come at different paces for different people, but loving what you do and working hard is key. Andy has weathered many criticisms and disappointments in his journey, so others should not be deterred by negativity either. 

- Entrepreneurship is not an easy life, but it provides more flexibility and fun. Seeing the journey of entrepreneurs like Chad Collins, who built businesses and events out of a YouTube channel started with his daughter, shows that entrepreneurship also provides valuable life lessons and experiences, especially for children. The future is bright, and there are many more platforms and opportunities to come.

 Here is a summary:

- There is great opportunity today for individuals to build audiences and businesses around their passions and expertise. People are spending increasing amounts of time consuming content on platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. The top creators and influencers on these platforms are earning a significant income. 

- Gary Vaynerchuk, the author, sees entrepreneurial opportunity in creating content and building audiences, especially on emerging platforms. He believes if you have a skill or passion and work hard to create great content around it, you have a chance to turn it into a successful business.

- The book covers strategies and advice for building audiences and businesses on platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, podcasts, and voice assistants. The key is simply getting started, being consistent, providing value, and adapting to changes in technology and platforms.
