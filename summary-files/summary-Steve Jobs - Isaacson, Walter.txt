 

Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs provides an in-depth look at the life and personality of the entrepreneur who revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. The book is based on more than 40 interviews with Jobs himself over two years, as well as interviews with over 100 family members, friends, competitors, and colleagues. 

Jobs was an eccentric perfectionist with a passion for control over both his professional and personal lives. The people and products he devoted himself to were deeply intertwined. Jobs cofounded Apple in 1976 with Steve Wozniak, releasing the Apple  II computer. He was fired from Apple in 1985 but returned in 1997 to turn the company around with innovative products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Jobs also cofounded Pixar Animation Studios, which produced hit computer-animated films such as Toy Story.

 Though complex and flawed, Jobs was a visionary who connected art and technology. His pursuit of perfection and simplicity revolutionized whole industries with products and services that deeply influenced both technological capability and design. Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of innovation, imagination, and sustained ambition. Though his intensity and obsession with control led to challenging relationships, his life provides countless lessons in crafting an original vision and sticking to it against all odds. The evolution of Apple and Jobs's other ventures in many ways marked the progress of industries in the digital age. Walter Isaacson's exclusive biography offers an unvarnished look at the man who most profoundly shaped an era.

 

• Steve Jobs initially asked Walter Isaacson to write his biography in 2004 but Isaacson declined, saying it was too early. Jobs asked again in 2009 and Isaacson agreed after Jobs’ wife Laurene Powell Jobs said “If you’re ever going to do a book on Steve, you’d better do it now.” 

• Jobs gave Isaacson complete control over the book and did not ask to review it in advance. However, Jobs later seemed to regret cooperating and stopped returning Isaacson's calls for a while. Jobs then called on New Year's Eve 2009 to reflect on his life and career.

• Jobs said his most creative period was the last 12 years of his life at Apple creating new products. His goal was to build a company that would outlive him, like Bill Hewlett and David Packard had done with HP.

• Jobs said he always wanted to stand at the intersection of the humanities and sciences, which was a theme that interested Isaacson.

• Jobs said he chose Isaacson to write his biography because “I think you’re good at getting people to talk.” Although Jobs was skittish about some people Isaacson wanted to interview, he ultimately encouraged them to speak openly and did not put any topics off limits.

• Isaacson conducted over 40 interviews with Jobs and over 100 interviews with his friends, family, colleagues and competitors. Jobs’ wife Laurene Powell Jobs encouraged Isaacson to be honest in portraying Jobs’ faults as well as his strengths. She did not ask to review the book in advance.

• Isaacson notes that Jobs could sometimes distort the truth or rewrite history in his own mind. Isaacson worked to check facts and flesh out the full story from as many sources as possible.

That covers the key highlights from how Walter Isaacson came to write Steve Jobs’ biography and the ground rules around cooperation, control and truthfulness that Isaacson established with Jobs and his wife. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 

- Paul Jobs and Clara Hagopian met and got married in 1946. Paul was a mechanic and Clara was the daughter of Armenian immigrants. 

- They desired children but Clara had trouble getting pregnant. In 1955, they adopted Steve Jobs.

- Steve Jobs was born to Joanne Schieble and Abdulfattah “John” Jandali, who were both 23 years old. Jandali was from Syria and pursuing his PhD. Schieble’s father disapproved of Jandali, threatening to disown her if they married.

- Schieble traveled to San Francisco to give birth and put the baby up for adoption. She wanted adoptive parents who were college graduates but the first couple she chose backed out. Steve Jobs was then adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs.

- Schieble initially refused to sign the adoption papers. She hoped to marry Jandali and get Steve back. But then her father died and she married Jandali. They later had another child, Mona.

- Paul Jobs was a high school dropout and mechanic. Clara was working as a bookkeeper. Despite their lack of higher education, Schieble relented and allowed them to adopt Steve, as long as they promised to fund his college education.

- Steve Jobs was named Steven Paul Jobs at birth. His biological parents were Joanne Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali. His adoptive parents were Paul and Clara Jobs.

The key events are: Steve Jobs’s birth and adoption, the initial refusal and then agreement by Schieble to have Steve adopted by the Jobses, Schieble's later marriage to Jandali, and some background on both the biological and adoptive parents. The summary paints a picture of how Steve Jobs ended up being adopted by the working-class Jobses despite Schieble's original wish for his adoptive parents to have college degrees.

 

- Steve Jobs was adopted as a baby by Paul and Clara Jobs. 
- His adoptive parents were very open about his adoption and told him that he was specifically chosen. This made him feel special but also abandoned. 
- Knowing he was adopted contributed to his sense of independence and made him feel like an outsider. His friend believes it led to his desire for control and that his cruel behavior at times stemmed from feelings of abandonment. However, Jobs dismissed this and said he never felt abandoned by his adoptive parents who he considered his "real" parents.
- Jobs grew up in 1950s California. His father, Paul Jobs, was a mechanic and taught Jobs about electronics and craftsmanship from an early age. They often went to junkyards to look for spare parts that Paul would use to build and fix up cars to resell. 
- Paul Jobs struggled with his career as a mechanic and real estate agent, and the family went through a period of financial hardship when Steve Jobs was in elementary school. However, Jobs admired his father's integrity and resolution. 
- Jobs grew up in a suburban tract home built by Joseph Eichler, who built inexpensive modernist homes. Jobs appreciated Eichler's vision of well-designed homes for ordinary people. This influenced his own desire to make good products for the mass market.
- Jobs's neighborhood was filled with engineers, including some "ne'er-do-wells." Growing up there fostered his interest in playing a role in Silicon Valley's history.

 

- Steve Jobs grew up in Silicon Valley, which was dominated by tech companies like Lockheed and Westinghouse that were producing technology for the military. This environment fostered an excitement around technology and innovation. 

- Important tech companies like Hewlett-Packard and Fairchild Semiconductor were also founded in the area. Fairchild was later abandoned by its founders, who started Intel. Intel went on to invent the microprocessor, catalyzing the growth of the chip industry in Silicon Valley.

- Jobs was an intelligent and willful child, and he often got bored in school. He frequently got in trouble by playing pranks on teachers and other students. His parents were loving but also willing to accommodate his needs and desires. They recognized that he was special and tried to stimulate him intellectually.

- Jobs had a sense from an early age that he was smarter and more clever than his parents and teachers. This contributed to his sense of detachment and independence. He resisted authority and disliked some of his early teachers.

- Jobs's fourth grade teacher, Imogene Hill, eventually became a mentor and champion for him. She likely recognized his abilities and potential, even when he got into trouble, and worked to stimulate him.

So in summary, Jobs grew up in an exciting environment for technology and innovation, was a precocious and willful child, resisted authority, and was fortunate to have parents and at least one teacher who recognized and cultivated his abilities. These early experiences shaped his personality and future success.

 

- Steve Jobs had a difficult experience in elementary school and was known as a loner. 
- In fourth grade, his teacher noticed his intelligence and had him IQ tested. He scored at a high school sophomore level.
- His parents moved him to a better school district for sixth grade. He had a hard time at his new school and was frequently bullied. He told his parents he would quit school if he couldn't transfer again.
- They moved again and he attended Homestead High School. He made a few friends who were into the counterculture movement. His pranks often involved electronics and building things. 
- He was mentored by Larry Lang, an engineer who lived down the street. Lang gave him spare parts and introduced him to Heathkits, which Jobs loved. 
- Lang also got him into the HP Explorers Club, where he got to see the company's new computers and lasers. He was inspired by the engineers and scientists he met there.
- When he needed HP parts for a project, he called Bill Hewlett, HP's CEO, at home to order them. Hewlett took his call and helped him with the parts.

 

- Steve Jobs got a summer job at an electronics manufacturer called Spectra-Physics after cold-calling the CEO. He worked on an assembly line putting together frequency counters but ingratiated himself with the engineers.

- Jobs loved to work and had a newspaper route. He also worked at an electronics store called Haltek that was like a "scavenger's paradise" filled with electronic components. Jobs learned how to negotiate good deals for parts by knowing their value. He bought and sold parts to make a profit.

- With money earned from his jobs, 15-year-old Jobs bought his first car, a Nash Metropolitan. Soon after, Jobs began regularly using marijuana and occasionally taking LSD and hash. 

- In high school, Jobs started to develop intellectually. He read works of literature and poetry. He had an excellent English teacher who inspired him.

- Jobs took an electronics class from teacher John McCollum. McCollum emphasized military discipline which Jobs rebelled against. Jobs didn't respect authority and McCollum never trusted Jobs enough to give him a key to the supply room. Jobs called a parts manufacturer collect to get a part McCollum didn't have, angering McCollum.

- Steve Wozniak became friends with Jobs during his time in McCollum's class. Wozniak was 5 years older but emotionally immature. Wozniak's father, like Jobs's father, taught his son a lot about electronics from an early age. However, Wozniak's father emphasized engineering over business. Wozniak learned never to lie from his father. Unlike Jobs, Wozniak lacked extreme ambition and was shy. By fourth grade, Wozniak became absorbed in electronics.

 

- Steve Wozniak was an electronics prodigy as a child. He built devices like an intercom system for his neighborhood as a kid. 

- He was fascinated by computers and aspired to build them. In high school, he designed computer chips and circuit boards for a calculator that won a contest. 

- Wozniak was more interested in electronics than socializing. He played pranks at school, once building a fake bomb that got him sent to juvenile detention. He was proud of taking random electric shocks as a "hardware engineer."

- Wozniak went to college at the University of Colorado Boulder but dropped out after a year. He then worked at a company building computers for the DMV. There, a coworker gave him spare parts to build his own computer.

- Wozniak built the "Cream Soda Computer" in a friend's garage. It was a simple computer that could multiply numbers. 

- His friend Bill introduced him to Steve Jobs. Wozniak and Jobs bonded over their love of pranks and music, especially Bob Dylan. They collected bootleg Dylan tapes and analyzed his lyrics.

- Wozniak, Jobs, and their friends pulled pranks at their high school, like lowering a vulgar banner at graduation and using a TV signal jammer to make people's TVs fuzzy until they touched the antenna.

- Overall, Wozniak and Jobs were electronics and prank-loving outsiders who bonded over those shared interests. Their partnership would eventually lead to the founding of Apple.

 

- Steve Jobs started dating Chrisann Brennan during his senior year in high school. Brennan was a junior at the time. 
- Brennan described Jobs as "kind of crazy" but she was attracted to that. Jobs had eccentric habits and behaved oddly at times.
- Jobs began experimenting with LSD around this time, and he introduced Brennan to it as well. Jobs described his first experience with LSD as feeling like "the conductor of this symphony with Bach coming through the wheat."
- After graduating from high school in 1972, Jobs and Brennan moved into a cabin in the hills above Los Altos. Jobs' father was furious when Jobs announced this plan and forbid it. But Jobs left anyway. 
- Brennan spent a lot of time that summer painting. She painted a portrait of a clown for Jobs which he kept for a long time.

The key events are:
1) Jobs starts dating Chrisann Brennan in high school 
2) Jobs begins experimenting with LSD and introduces Brennan to it
3) After graduation, Jobs and Brennan move into a cabin together against Jobs' father's wishes
4) Brennan spends the summer painting, including painting a clown portrait for Jobs

The summary touches on the key details around Jobs' relationship with Chrisann Brennan during this time, including experiences with LSD and defying his father to move into a cabin with Brennan.

 

- Steve Jobs enrolled in Reed College in 1972 where he became interested in spirituality and enlightenment. 
- He read books like Be Here Now which influenced him and his friends like Daniel Kottke. 
- They engaged in dorm discussions about philosophy, went to Hare Krishna temples, and practiced Zen meditation. 
- Jobs and Kottke became very interested in Zen Buddhism, meditation, and intuition. However, Jobs' intensity made it hard for him to achieve inner peace.
- They took psychedelic drugs and engaged in eccentric activities like playing a German board game called Kriegspiel. 
- Jobs and Kottke became strict vegetarians, influenced by books like Diet for a Small Planet. Jobs would go on extreme fasts and purges, and once turned orange from eating so many carrots.
- Jobs embraced eccentric diets and fasts with his usual intensity, fasting for over a week at a time and carefully breaking them by drinking water and eating leafy greens. He felt energized from these long fasts.

In summary, during his first year at Reed College, Steve Jobs pursued spirituality and adventure with the same passion and eccentricity that he pursued technology and business. His experiences shaped his thinking in profound ways for the rest of his life.

 

- Steve Jobs dropped out of Reed College after one semester because he didn't want to take required classes that didn't interest him and he felt guilty that his working-class parents were paying expensive tuition for seemingly pointless education. 

- However, Jobs loved being at Reed and was able to stay there by auditing classes he was interested in, like a calligraphy class. He found calligraphy fascinating and beautiful in an artistic sense that science couldn't capture. This calligraphy class would later influence his emphasis on design and aesthetics in Apple products.

- At Reed, Jobs was influenced by Robert Friedland, an older student who led a commune called the All One Farm. Jobs would spend weekends there, pruning apple trees and going on spiritual journeys. However, Friedland began running the commune more like a cult and business, and Jobs got sick of it. Though Jobs was influenced by Friedland's charismatic personality early on, he later saw Friedland as a "con man."

- Jobs adopted some of Friedland's traits, like his ability to stare intensely at people and bend situations to his will. But in other ways, such as Friedland's outgoing personality, Jobs was very different. Friedland helped bring Jobs out of his shell and become more comfortable "taking charge of a situation."

- In summary, Reed College gave Jobs a chance to explore various interests that shaped his thinking, from Zen Buddhism to calligraphy. But the most influential figure was Robert Friedland, who contributed both positive and negative impacts on Jobs' personality and philosophy.

 

- Steve Jobs dropped out of Reed College after one semester but continued to audit classes, including a calligraphy course. That course influenced his design sense and passion for typography, which later became key attributes of the Macintosh.

- After leaving Reed, Jobs lived a bohemian lifestyle. He went on extreme diets, went barefoot, and took LSD, which he said was one of the most important experiences of his life. He earned money by doing work for Atari. 

- In early 1974, Jobs traveled to India in search of spiritual enlightenment. His friend Dan Kottke joined him. They were seeking guidance from Neem Karoli Baba, but he had died before they arrived. Still, the trip profoundly impacted Jobs.

- When Jobs told Atari he was quitting to go to India, Al Alcorn was amused but sent him to Germany to fix an interference issue with the Atari gaming systems. Jobs solved the problem but annoyed the German engineers with his behavior and diet. However, the trip to Italy that followed was a good experience for him.

- Jobs believed his trip to India sowed the seeds for his future spirituality and quest for intuition and simplicity. The design aesthetic it led to and the type of people he surrounded himself with emerged at Apple. His experiences in India also reinforced his tendency to eschew material objects and the desire to lead a simple life.

 

- Steve Jobs traveled to India in 1974 at the age of 19 to seek spiritual enlightenment. 

- He arrived in New Delhi but got sick with dysentery shortly thereafter. He traveled around India visiting various holy sites and gurus.

- He met Larry Brilliant, who became a lifelong friend, and they traveled together. At one point, a Hindu holy man shaved Jobs's head.

- Daniel Kottke, Jobs's friend from Reed College, joined him in India for a bit. At one point Kottke's belongings and money were stolen, so Jobs gave him the rest of his own money to help out.

- After seven months, Jobs returned home to his parents in the US. He continued seeking enlightenment by meditating, studying Zen Buddhism, and auditing classes at Stanford. 

- Jobs was profoundly influenced by what he learned in India about intuition, spirituality, and simplicity. He said it made a "big impact on my work."

- Once back in California, Jobs became a devoted follower of Kobun Chino Otogawa, a Zen Buddhist master who taught in Los Altos. Jobs would meditate with him regularly and they went on retreats together. Kobun later married Jobs and his wife.

- Jobs also underwent primal scream therapy, a new age therapy technique based on re-suffering past pains. Jobs went to the Oregon Feeling Center for 12 weeks of the therapy. He found it helped him gain insight into himself.

- In summary, Jobs's trip to India and his subsequent spiritual explorations throughout the 1970s shaped his values and way of thinking for the rest of his life.

 

Steve Jobs was struggling emotionally with being put up for adoption as a baby and not knowing his biological parents. He went through primal scream therapy, a process developed by Arthur Janov to address repressed pain. Although the therapy did not prove hugely insightful for Jobs, it gave him more confidence and reduced his feelings of inadequacy. 

Jobs believed he could impart confidence to others and push them to achieve in ways they did not think possible. He demonstrated this with his ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Holmes, convincing her to drive partway to an apple farm even though she did not know how to drive stick shift. His charisma and persuasiveness, which would become known as his “reality distortion field,” allowed him to convince others that the impossible was possible.

Jobs returned to Atari in 1975 and partnered with Steve Wozniak to design a single-player version of the game Pong. Though the task seemed impossible, Jobs assured Wozniak he could do it. Wozniak stayed up four nights in a row and designed the game using only 45 chips. Jobs implemented Wozniak’s design. Allegedly, Jobs received a bonus for keeping the chip count under 50 but only paid Wozniak half the base fee and did not share the bonus. Wozniak believes that Jobs needed the money but did not tell him the truth. The incident highlighted the difference in their personalities, with Wozniak caring deeply about ethics and Jobs being more manipulative. 

The experience at Atari shaped Jobs’s approach to business and design. He appreciated Atari’s simple, easy-to-use games. Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell became a mentor figure who taught Jobs to act confidently in control so that others would believe it.

 
- There was a hacker subculture in Silicon Valley that included engineers, hobbyists, and counterculture members. 
- Groups studied LSD and included people like Doug Engelbart and Ken Kesey. The hippie and anti-war movements were prevalent. Various spiritual and enlightenment movements were in the area. 
- Steve Jobs embodied the fusion of counterculture and technology. He was interested in electronics and spirituality. Culturally, the area produced influential music like Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane. 
- Initially, the technologists and hippies did not get along well. Many in the counterculture were suspicious of computers. But by the early 1970s, computing became a symbol of individual freedom. People saw the potential in computers for liberation and expression.
- Stewart Brand and the Whole Earth Catalog helped foster connections between the counterculture and hackers. The catalog focused on tools for individual empowerment and education. Brand saw Jobs as embodying the fusion of the catalog's ideals. 
- The People's Computer Company and Homebrew Computer Club brought together counterculture and tech members. The club started after the Altair computer kit was featured in Popular Mechanics. Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs attended a meeting and Wozniak was inspired to create the Apple I. 
- Wozniak wanted to create an affordable computer with a keyboard, screen, and built-in CPU. He used inexpensive microprocessors and designed the Apple I in 1975. He showed it to Jobs, who was impressed with the achievement.

In summary, Silicon Valley had a unique convergence of counterculture and tech sensibilities in the 1970s. Stewart Brand and places like the Homebrew Computer Club fostered connections that inspired innovations like the Apple I. Although the groups started apart, by the mid-70s computing became a liberating tool for many in the counterculture. This fusion of values lives on in Silicon Valley's culture today.

 

- Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple Inc. in 1976 to sell printed circuit boards for Wozniak's computer that he built. 
- Wozniak was an electronics engineer who built a computer as a hobby. He would show it off to people at the Homebrew Computer Club. Jobs was a friend who helped Wozniak get free components for the computer.
- Jobs came up with the idea to sell printed circuit boards to others who wanted to build the computer. Even though Wozniak didn't think they would make money, Jobs convinced him it would be an adventure if they started their own company.
- To raise money, Wozniak sold his calculator and Jobs sold his van. With some of their own savings, they gathered about $1,300 to start the company.
- They needed a name and decided on "Apple Computer" because Jobs had just come back from working at an apple farm. They thought it sounded fun and approachable. 
- At first, Wozniak still worked at HP while helping Apple in his spare time. Jobs and Ron Wayne, an Atari engineer, convinced Wozniak to commit his computer designs to Apple. In exchange, Wayne got a 10% share of the partnership. 
- Wayne wrote a formal partnership agreement that gave 45% shares each to Jobs and Wozniak and 10% to himself. But Wayne soon got nervous and ended up relinquishing his share. 
- So Jobs and Wozniak became equal partners in Apple Computer. Wozniak handled the technical aspects while Jobs focused on marketing. Though different in personality, they made an effective team.

 

- Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple Computer in 1976. 
- Their friend Ron Wayne initially joined them as a partner but withdrew after only 11 days because he was worried about potential financial liability if the company struggled. In exchange for giving up his 10% stake in Apple, he received $2,300. If he had kept his stake, it would have been worth over $2 billion by 2010. 
- Jobs and Wozniak demonstrated an early Apple computer circuit board at the Homebrew Computer Club. Most were unimpressed but Paul Terrell, owner of the Byte Shop, ordered 50 fully assembled computers for $500 each. 
- To fulfill the order, Jobs and Wozniak assembled the computers in Jobs' family garage with help from friends and family. They bought parts on credit and sold the extra computers to friends and retail stores. 
- Elizabeth Holmes was hired as a part-time bookkeeper, paid $4/hour. An answering service relayed messages to Jobs' mother. Ron Wayne drew Apple's first logo. 
- Wozniak wanted to sell the computers for slightly above cost but Jobs insisted on a 33% profit margin. They priced the computers at $666.66. 
- An article in Interface Magazine reported on the new company and quoted Jobs discussing understanding customers to give them what they want. This made Apple sound like a real company.

In summary, Jobs and Wozniak founded Apple in 1976 and built their first computers in a garage to sell to local stores and enthusiasts. Through a combination of vision, ambition, and boundless enthusiasm, they transformed their hobby into a budding business.

 

- By 1976, the Apple I had competitors like the Altair, IMSAI 8080, and SOL-20. Jobs and Wozniak attended a computer festival where they saw these competitors' products.

- Jobs realized that for mainstream success, they needed a fully integrated product with a good case, keyboard, and power supply. Wozniak built a prototype of the Apple II to create color graphics. They tried unsuccessfully to sell it to Atari and Commodore.

- To build the Apple II, they needed capital. Wozniak's father felt that Wozniak deserved more of the credit and money, but Wozniak recognized that Jobs's contributions were crucial to Apple's success. Jobs asked their partner Ron Wayne to design a case, but Jobs didn't like his design.

- Jobs hired consultant Jerry Manock to design a plastic case. Jobs also wanted an unusual power supply that didn't require a fan. He found power supply expert Rod Holt to design it. The switching power supply was a key innovation for the Apple II.

- Jobs insisted on a closed, tightly controlled system with only two slots, over Wozniak's objections. Wozniak recognized that he was losing some control over the company's direction to Jobs. 

-They needed an investor to fund the development and manufacturing of the Apple II.

 

- Steve Jobs wanted to productionize and market the Apple II computer, but it was going to cost $100K to tool the plastic case and $200K total to get into production.

- Jobs asked his former boss Nolan Bushnell to invest $50K for a third of the equity, but Bushnell declined.

- Bushnell suggested Jobs talk to Don Valentine, a VC who founded Sequoia Capital. Valentine was put off by Jobs's appearance and lack of marketing knowledge but said he'd fund him if Jobs found a marketing/distribution partner.

- Jobs connected with Mike Markkula, a 33-year-old retired Intel executive. Markkula was impressed with the Apple II and wrote a business plan with Jobs detailing how to market it to average consumers. 

- Markkula invested $250K for a third of the equity and guaranteed a $250K line of credit. Jobs convinced Wozniak to leave HP to work at Apple full-time.

- On January 3, 1977, the new company Apple Computer Co. was formed. Markkula became a father figure to Jobs and taught him about marketing and sales.

- Markkula wrote a marketing philosophy for Apple focused on three points: empathy with the customer; focus on key products; and the perception and signals (impute) a company conveys. Jobs would carry these lessons through his career.

- The first step was hiring the Valley's top PR person, Regis McKenna, to represent Apple. Jobs doggedly pursued McKenna's team until they agreed to visit. They were impressed by the Apple II.

 

- Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were young, unpolished entrepreneurs when they met Regis McKenna, a public relations expert.

- Wozniak was prickly and defensive, but Jobs and McKenna hit it off. McKenna's team helped redesign Apple's marketing materials and created a new logo. 

- Jobs insisted on perfection and lavished care on the launch of the Apple II computer at the West Coast Computer Faire. He paid in advance for prime booth space and required his small team to wear suits.

- The launch was a success, leading to 300 orders. But Wozniak also played some practical jokes, like creating a fake ad for a nonexistent computer called the "Zaltair."

- As Apple grew quickly, Jobs struggled with the responsibilities of running a real company. He was temperamental and critical, and he lacked hygiene. Mike Scott was brought in as president to provide management experience.

- Scott and Jobs clashed frequently. Scott insisted that Jobs bathe more, and he wouldn't give Jobs the employee badge number he wanted. They disagreed on many issues, like the design of the Apple II case and standard benches. Scott was more pragmatic, but Jobs obsessed over perfection.  -

- Their disputes highlighted the differences in their personalities and priorities. Scott focused on practical management issues, while Jobs cared passionately about product excellence and user experience.

 

- Steve Jobs and Chrisann Brennan were in an on-again, off-again relationship for five years before Brennan became pregnant in 1977. 

- Jobs was disconnected from the situation and denied paternity, even though he was the only man Brennan had been with. He suggested she have an abortion or give the baby up for adoption but discouraged the latter.

- Jobs and Brennan were both 23 at the time, the same age as Jobs' biological parents when he was born. Jobs only later realized this coincidence.

- The relationship between Jobs and Brennan deteriorated. Brennan became emotionally unstable, breaking things, trashing the house, and writing obscenities on the walls. She felt Jobs and their mutual friend Daniel Kottke were ganging up on her.

- Kottke was caught in the middle of their arguments. He said Jobs could be callous and ruthless, in contrast with Kottke's own more gentle nature.

- Brennan decided to have the baby, Lisa, even though Jobs did not want to commit to marriage or parenthood.

That covers the key highlights from this part of the passage on Chrisann Brennan's pregnancy and the difficult relationship issues surrounding it. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 

- Steve Jobs wanted to create a new product to make a dent in the universe and move beyond the Apple II.
- The Apple III flopped because it was poorly engineered and Jobs had distanced himself from it.
- Jobs then conceived of a completely new computer called the "Lisa" named after his daughter he had abandoned. 
- The Lisa was meant to be a $2000 computer but the engineers had trouble making it exciting. 
- Bill Atkinson, an Apple programmer, was able to infuse life into the project. He was passionate and Jobs gave him a chance to prove the usefulness of the Lisa.
- By Fall 1979, the Lisa project was pursuing new technological directions under Atkinson's guidance.

 

- Apple had three projects to potentially replace the Apple II: the Apple III, the Lisa, and Jef Raskin's low-cost computer concept. 

- Raskin visited Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and saw they were developing new concepts like a graphical user interface, bitmapping, and object-oriented programming. He wanted Apple to see it.

- Steve Jobs didn't like Raskin but agreed to visit XEROX PARC in exchange for allowing Xerox to buy Apple stock. Xerox showed off their GUI and Smalltalk programming language.

- Jobs and his team were amazed at the GUI and immediately wanted to implement it. They estimated it would take 6 months, though it ended up being very optimistic.

- There are differing views on Apple's use of Xerox's concepts. Some saw it as Apple stealing great ideas. Others saw it as Xerox fumbling a great opportunity. The truth is complex: Apple significantly improved on Xerox's concepts and implemented them in a way Xerox could not.

- The improvements included making a cheaper, better mouse, allowing dragged windows and files to be dropped in folders, and transforming the desktop metaphor into something more intuitive and interactive. Apple's designers and engineers worked closely on these improvements, spurred on by Jobs.

- In summary, Apple took inspiration from Xerox PARC but then made that inspiration into their own, ultimately far more successful innovations. Execution and implementation were just as important as the original good ideas.

 

- In 1981, Apple Inc. went public in an initial public offering (IPO) that made over 300 employees into millionaires. The valuation of the company after its IPO was $1.79 billion. 

- Steve Jobs's friend Daniel Kottke was an early Apple employee who helped Jobs in college and worked for Apple since it started in Jobs's garage. However, Kottke was not given stock options because he was an hourly technician, though Jobs could have given him "founder's stock." Jobs's refusal to do so led to a rift in their friendship.

- Steve Wozniak, on the other hand, gave stock options to many mid-level Apple employees before the IPO so they could buy homes. In total, Wozniak's stock options made 40 employees into millionaires. However, Wozniak's then-wife later divorced him and kept their home.

- Steve Jobs made sure his deal with Chrisann Brennan, the mother of his daughter Lisa, was signed before the IPO. Jobs helped choose the investment banks to handle Apple's IPO: the traditional Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley and the smaller San Francisco firm Hambrecht & Quist. Jobs criticized Morgan Stanley for initially pricing Apple's stock too low at $18 per share.

- In summary, Apple's IPO created immense wealth for Jobs, Wozniak, and many early Apple employees. However, Jobs's unwillingness to share this wealth with his friend Daniel Kottke led to the breakup of their friendship. Wozniak, on the other hand, generously shared his newfound wealth with many Apple colleagues.

 

- Jef Raskin, an eccentric and philosophical computer scientist, convinced Mike Markkula to fund a small team within Apple to develop an inexpensive computer for the masses. 
- Raskin named the project "Macintosh" after his favorite apple and envisioned a $1,000 computer that was an all-in-one screen, keyboard and computer. 
- To keep costs down, Raskin proposed using a small, low-powered processor and a tiny 5-inch screen. He wrote his thoughts in a notebook called "The Book of Macintosh."
- The Macintosh project struggled for years to gain approval and resources within Apple. It was almost killed off several times, but Raskin kept persuading Markkula to fund it. 
- The small Macintosh team worked in cramped quarters, filled with toys and gadgets, and were occasionally distracted by Nerf ball fights. The star engineer was Burrell Smith, a talented self-taught engineer.

 

- Steve Jobs and Jef Raskin clashed over the development of the Macintosh computer. Raskin favored building an inexpensive computer for the masses while Jobs wanted to build an "insanely great" machine. 

- They disagreed on many technical specifications for the computer like the microprocessor power and the use of graphics like icons and a mouse. Raskin favored keyboard-based interaction while Jobs wanted a graphical user interface.

- Raskin's former student Bill Atkinson sided with Jobs, as did other engineers like Burrell Smith and Andy Hertzfeld. Jobs took over control of the Macintosh project from Raskin.

- Raskin complained about Jobs's management style and temperament. Raskin asserted that Jobs was a "dreadful manager" who didn't give credit where it was due and acted without thinking. Raskin and Jobs agreed they couldn't work together.

- Though unfair, Raskin's ouster was good for the Macintosh. Raskin's vision was for an underpowered computer while Jobs helped transform personal computing by creating a powerful machine with a graphical user interface. Raskin went on to work on the Canon Cat, which flopped.

- After taking over the Macintosh project, Jobs aggressively recruited engineers like Andy Hertzfeld to the team. Though hesitant to leave his work on the Apple II, Hertzfeld joined the Macintosh team at Jobs's insistence. Jobs said "The Macintosh is the future of Apple, and you're going to start on it now!"

 

- Steve Jobs recruited passionate and talented people to work on the Macintosh by showing them the prototype and watching for their reaction. If they were extremely impressed and excited, he would hire them. 

- Steve Jobs had a "reality distortion field" that allowed him to convince people of almost anything and bend facts to his purpose. His charisma and persuasiveness made it hard for people to resist his vision, even if it was unrealistic. His team would make jokes about "the reality distortion field" and how it was dangerous to get caught up in it.

- The reality distortion field involved both deceiving himself and others. Jobs would assert things as facts without caring about the truth. His team said it allowed him to get people to do the impossible because no one realized it was impossible. 

- The root of this ability was Jobs's belief that the rules didn't apply to him. He thought he was special and chosen, like famous enlightened people. He was rebellious and willful, ignoring reality if it didn't match his desires. His view of the world was very binary - things and people were either the best or the worst.

- Working under Jobs was difficult because he put certain talented people on a pedestal as "gods" who could do no wrong, but then would knock them down if they failed to meet expectations. The people who were seen as "gods" lived in fear of losing that status and being seen as worthless. Jobs's binary way of viewing the world meant people were either gods or "shitheads".

- In summary, Steve Jobs was able to accomplish amazing things through his persuasiveness, vision, and willingness to bend the facts. But his reality distortion field and harsh judgment of others also made him a challenging person to work for. His belief that the normal rules didn't apply to him fueled both these qualities.

 

- Steve Jobs had a tendency to frequently and abruptly change his opinions. His views were intense but ephemeral. His team at Apple learned to not overreact to his pronouncements and temperamental shifts.

- Jobs was perceptive about people and their motivations. He was adept at manipulating people by knowing their vulnerabilities and insecurities. His behavior often left people feeling weakened and eager for his approval. 

- Jobs's demanding and hurtful behavior took an emotional toll, but it also motivated his team to do their best work. Those who were not crushed by Jobs emerged stronger. If you stood up to Jobs and earned his respect, he would promote you. His team gave out annual awards for those who best stood up to him.

- Jobs was a perfectionist and had little patience for those who compromised to meet schedules or budgets. He pushed his team to make a great product, not just a profitable one. His passion for excellence inspired his team.

- While Jobs's abusive behavior likely was not necessary or justified, his contributions to Apple were monumental. His style was imperfect but integral to his achievements. A mix of his style and a more patient, less conflictual style may have produced an even better result.

In summary, Jobs had a dynamic and often difficult personality that profoundly shaped his team for better and for worse. His intensity, passion for perfection, and ability to motivate were balanced by his volatility, harshness, and desire to manipulate. Working with him was deeply inspiring and draining. His leadership style produced remarkable results but at a human cost. A more modulated style may have achieved an even greater impact. Overall, Jobs had an indelible influence, not all of which was positive, on those around him.

 

- Steve Jobs was influenced by the spare, functional design philosophy of the German Bauhaus movement. He admired the Bauhaus emphasis on simplicity, rationality, and functionality. He wanted Apple's products to have a simple, clean design like Braun's consumer electronic products. 

- Jobs believed that design simplicity should be matched by ease of use. He wanted Apple's products to be intuitive and easy to navigate. As an example, he cited the desktop metaphor of the Macintosh, with its familiar desktop and document icons. 

- When Jobs took over the Macintosh project, he insisted that the computer should have a distinctive, sleek design that took up little space. He wanted it to have classic lines, like a Porsche or Mercedes, that would not go out of style. After rejecting several prototypes as too boxy or not curvaceous enough, the design team developed a model that Jobs considered "a start." They went through many iterations to refine and improve the design to Jobs's satisfaction.

- Jobs admired the spare, minimalist aesthetics of Japanese Zen Buddhism. He was deeply moved by the Zen gardens and art of Kyoto. His Zen-influenced sensibility led him to embrace minimalism in design but in a way that remained fun and playful rather than cold. His Buddhist training was a big influence on his design aesthetic.

- The overall impression is that Steve Jobs was a perfectionist with a strong vision for elegant, minimalist, and seamless product design. He was deeply involved in the minute details of the design, pursuing a sublime simplicity that would make an emotional connection with users. His design philosophy and aesthetic sensibilities shaped Apple's products and brand in a profound way.

 

- Steve Jobs was obsessed with the design details of the Macintosh computer. 
- He spent a lot of time examining and critiquing the smallest details that most people wouldn't even notice. 
- He wanted the computer to look friendly, so the design team made it look like a human face with a recessed chin. 
- Jobs insisted that the graphics should be able to draw ovals, circles and rounded rectangles. The design team had to figure out a way to accomplish this.
- Jobs was also passionately interested in typography and fonts. He named the Macintosh fonts after cities he liked. 
- He spent a huge amount of time obsessing over tiny design details like the title bars and icons. He demanded simplicity and perfection. 
- One designer, Chris Espinosa, found a way to satisfy Jobs by creating a "construction set" that let Jobs tweak the design himself. 
- Jobs hired a world-class designer, Hartmut Esslinger, to create a consistent design language for Apple products called "Snow White." Esslinger proposed a "born-in-America" design inspired by California. 
- Jobs believed in craftsmanship, even for parts that no one would see. He critiqued the design of the circuit board inside the Macintosh on aesthetic grounds.
- In summary, Jobs was a perfectionist and obsessed with simplicity, design, and craftsmanship in a way that pushed his team to new heights but also drove them crazy at times. His passion for design and the user experience shaped Apple's distinctive approach.

 

- Steve Jobs wanted end-to-end control over the user experience. He believed that for a computer to be great, the hardware and software had to be tightly integrated. 
- Jobs did not want others modifying or changing his creations. He saw computers as "whole widgets" that were designed end-to-end with the software tailored to the hardware. This belief distinguished the Macintosh from Microsoft's more open operating system.
- Jobs's desire for control was seen in his debate with Steve Wozniak over expansion slots in the Apple II. Jobs won that debate and the Macintosh had limited slots and was closed. This made it unhackable but gave a controlled experience. 
- The Macintosh did not have cursor keys, forcing people to use the mouse. This also forced software developers to design software specifically for the Mac rather than generic software that could work on any computer. 
- Jobs believed end-to-end control leads to awesome products, though it is not always the best strategy for dominating a market. His systems were always closed to prevent people from modifying them.
- Jobs's desire for control reflected his perfectionist personality. He wanted to control the user experience and not have people doing "crazy things" to his products.

In summary, Steve Jobs was a perfectionist who believed in tightly controlling the user experience. He designed systems that were closed and integrated end-to-end, sacrificing some market share for what he saw as superior products.

 

- Steve Jobs was against licensing the Macintosh operating system to other companies and allowing them to make clones. He wanted to maintain tight control over the user experience. In 1982, the marketing director Mike Murray proposed licensing the Mac OS to Tandy, but Jobs rejected the idea.

- In 1982, Jobs thought he would be named Time's Man of the Year. A reporter came to interview him and his team, but the magazine instead chose "the Computer" as its topic and named it "Machine of the Year." The article profiled Jobs but was very critical of him. Jobs was devastated that he was not named Man of the Year.

- The Lisa computer launched in 1983 but failed commercially due to its high price and lack of clear target audience. Within two years it was discontinued. But its failure helped shift Apple's focus to the upcoming Macintosh. 

- The Macintosh team moved into its own building and Jobs kept tight control over hiring. He looked for creative, intelligent, rebellious people. Jobs would ask bizarre interview questions to test how well applicants could think on their feet. 

- Although Jobs could be rude and harsh, he was also able to inspire his team with a sense of mission and purpose. Every six months, he would take the team on a retreat to re-energize them. At one retreat, he emphasized that they should not compromise and should make the Mac "insanely great." He told them "the journey is the reward" - they would look back on this time together as a magical experience.

In summary, Jobs was a perfectionist and control freak who was difficult but also able to deeply motivate his team. His obsession with creating an "insanely great" product without compromise led to delays in shipping the Macintosh. But it also resulted in aMacintosh that profoundly reshaped personal computing.

 

- In early 1983, Steve Jobs held a company retreat to rally the Apple teams working on the Macintosh. He emphasized that they were going to "put a dent in the universe" and that "real artists ship". However, tensions were high as the launch of the Lisa had been disappointing. 

- The Mac team wanted to use a new 3.5-inch disk drive that Sony had developed, but the corporate division at Apple wanted them to use a problematic drive called Twiggy. When Jobs saw the high failure rate of Twiggy, he wanted to fire the whole team.

- Jobs, Belleville, and Rod Holt went to Japan to look at alternatives. Jobs was rude to their hosts and hated most of the options. He decided to have Alps, a smaller company, build a clone of the Sony drive.

- However, Belleville secretly had Sony work on their drive anyway as a backup. They sent Hidetoshi Komoto, the lead engineer, to work clandestinely with the Mac team. They had to frequently hide Komoto from Jobs when he would visit.

- It turned out Belleville's plan was necessary: Alps said it would take 18 months to produce their drive. When Jobs found out Belleville had been working with Sony, he was furious but then started grinning, appreciating Belleville's renegade solution. The Sony drive was used in the first Macs.

- The story shows that while Jobs pushed for innovation and doing things differently, key team members had learned they sometimes needed to ignore his directives and do what they thought was right. If they were proved correct, Jobs would come to appreciate their willful behavior.

 

- Mike Markkula wanted to step down as Apple's president in 1982 and asked Steve Jobs to find a replacement. 
- Jobs and Markkula wanted to hire Don Estridge, who built IBM's PC division, but Estridge declined their offer.
- They then hired Gerry Roche, a headhunter, to find a consumer marketer to replace Markkula. They decided to target John Sculley, the president of PepsiCo.
- Sculley met with Jobs in 1983 and was intrigued by him, though Sculley came from a very different background. Sculley flew out to Apple and wrote a memo with suggestions for marketing computers. 
- Jobs and Sculley continued to meet and bond over similar qualities like perfectionism. Though Sculley enjoyed the lavish perks of working for PepsiCo, he found his conversations with Jobs stimulating.
- Sculley visited Apple in Cupertino, where Jobs showed him the Macintosh prototype. Jobs wanted Sculley's input and for Sculley to share his excitement over the Macintosh. Sculley, however, seemed underwhelmed by the initial demo. 
- Steve Hertzfeld, who helped with the demo, found Sculley to be "incredibly phony." Hertzfeld believed Sculley was more interested in marketing and image than technology and substance.

In summary, as Markkula wanted to step down, Jobs targeted John Sculley, the president of PepsiCo, as Apple's potential next CEO. Though Sculley was intrigued by Jobs' passion, others like Hertzfeld felt Sculley was more focused on superficial marketing than real technology.

 

- Steve Jobs recruits John Sculley, then the CEO of Pepsi, to become the CEO of Apple in 1983. Jobs is very persuasive and sells Sculley on the idea that they are alike and will work well together.

- At first, Sculley and Jobs seem to have a great partnership. They frequently talk and see themselves as soul mates with a lot in common. But soon, their differences and contrasting leadership styles start causing problems. 

- Jobs realizes early on that Sculley is not as visionary or adept as Jobs had hoped. Sculley is more interested in pleasing people and struggles to manage Apple's dysfunctional culture. Jobs grows increasingly contemptuous of Sculley as a result.

- The partnership unravels as it becomes clear that Sculley does not match Jobs's projections of him. Sculley is put off by Jobs's rudeness and harsh treatment of workers. The two have different values and ways of looking at the world.

- In summary, Jobs and Sculley's partnership starts off promising but quickly falls apart due to their glaring differences in leadership, values, and vision. Jobs's manipulation and distortion of Sculley also contributes to the fracturing of their relationship.

 

- Jobs and Sculley often clashed due to their different personalities and management styles. Sculley thought Jobs was difficult to work with because of his erratic mood swings and harsh criticism of others. 

- They disagreed over the pricing of the Macintosh. Jobs wanted to price it at $1995 but Sculley insisted on $2495 to account for marketing costs. Jobs was furious but Sculley prevailed. Jobs felt he was losing control of his company.

- At an Apple sales conference in 1983, Jobs tried to rally the team by portraying the competition with IBM as a dramatic showdown between good and evil. He previewed the famous "1984" ad to motivate the sales team.

- The Macintosh software team needed two more weeks to finish the code but Jobs insisted they ship it on schedule. He pushed them to meet the deadline, which they did by working three all-nighters in a row. 

- Jobs asked an ad agency to create a revolutionary ad for the Macintosh launch. They came up with the "1984" ad, portraying Apple as the rebel underdog fighting against a Orwellian establishment. The ad captured the zeitgeist of personal empowerment that computers represented. 

- Although Jobs saw himself as a rebel, he had become more corporate. He insisted on selling Apple I boards instead of sharing the design for free, as Wozniak wanted. But the "1984" ad helped Jobs regain his countercultural reputation.

The summary touches on the key events, interactions, and decisions around the launch of the Macintosh, especially the disagreements, challenges, and marketing strategies involved. The assistant identifies the themes of clashes in management styles, fights for control, motivation of the teams, and Jobs's pursuit of his rebel reputation.

 

- Steve Jobs wanted to take Apple public but not give stock options to early employees. 
- The Macintosh went against the values of hacker culture. It was expensive, closed, and controlled. 
- The 1984 ad reaffirmed Steve Jobs' self-image as a rebel. It let Apple link itself to rebellious hackers. 
- Initially, Apple's board and CEO John Sculley disliked the 1984 ad. But others, like Steve Wozniak, liked it. Apple ended up airing it during the Super Bowl, where it was a huge success. 
- Steve Jobs was great at generating publicity for new products. He courted journalists and gave exclusive access in exchange for lavish coverage. 
- For the Macintosh launch, Steve Jobs orchestrated media hype, an iconic ad, and a dramatic public unveiling. 
- Although exhausted, Andy Hertzfeld and others created a demo for the event in just a few days. Steve Jobs made some changes to the demo at the last minute.

So in summary, Steve Jobs wanted to control Apple and move away from hacker roots. But with the Macintosh launch, he generated hype and rebellion to attract support from customers and the media. The launch event itself, with its dramatic unveiling, capped off Jobs' masterful marketing plan.

 

- Steve Jobs insisted that the Macintosh be the first computer to introduce itself at its launch event. 

- The rehearsals the night before were chaotic and went on for hours. Jobs was perfectionistic and demanding, driving everyone crazy with constant changes. Sculley tried to help but was out of his depth.

- Jobs was very nervous before the launch and asked Sculley to wish him good luck. 

- Jobs opened the shareholders meeting by reading a Bob Dylan poem. Sculley gave a boring report on Apple's finances but ended by praising his "friendship" with Jobs.

- Jobs gave a dramatic speech comparing IBM's dominance of the industry to the dystopia in George Orwell's 1984. He then unveiled the Macintosh, which gave a humorous self-introduction to wild applause.

- Jobs rewarded the Macintosh team with their own personalized computers. Though the development process was difficult, neither Wozniak, Raskin, Sculley or anyone else could have achieved what Jobs did. 

- Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were the defining entrepreneurs of the early PC era, though they had very different personalities and backgrounds. Gates was more practical and analytical, while Jobs was intuitive, romantic and focused on design. Though both could be rude, Gates was more intellectually incisive, while Jobs could be emotionally callous. Each thought he was smarter than the other.

 

- Steve Jobs and Bill Gates had a complicated relationship. They were fascinated by each other but also critical of one another. 
- Gates thought Jobs was odd and flawed. Jobs thought Gates was unimaginative and not an inventor.
- They differed in personality and style. Jobs was an artist and perfectionist who wanted control. Gates was analytical, pragmatic, and willing to license software to others. 
- At first, Gates and Microsoft were impressed with the Macintosh. They agreed to develop software for it, including Excel, Word, and BASIC. 
- But Gates didn't appreciate the Mac's elegance and questioned some of Jobs's decisions. Jobs would alternate between promoting the Mac as world-changing and worrying that it would fail. 
- Their relationship grew strained. Jobs backed out of bundling Microsoft software with the Mac, hurting Apple more than Microsoft. Microsoft began focusing more on software for IBM PCs.
- Though they unveiled Excel for Mac together, tensions remained. Jobs joked that they'd all be "dead in time" when asked if Excel would come to IBM PCs. 
- In summary, while they started out friendly, rivalries in the tech world and differences in vision ultimately drove Jobs and Gates apart. But they maintained a grudging respect for each other's skills.

 

Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created Apple Computer in 1976. They released the Apple II, which was a very successful personal computer. In the early 1980s, Jobs led the development of the Macintosh, which was launched in 1984 and featured a graphical user interface, windows, icons, and a mouse. 

Jobs was eager to work with Microsoft to provide software for the Macintosh. However, Bill Gates and Microsoft soon created Windows, their own graphical operating system to compete with the Mac. Jobs felt betrayed and believed that Microsoft had stolen the Mac's interface. However, Apple had originally taken many of these interface ideas from Xerox PARC. Legally, Gates and Microsoft were within their rights. Still, the Windows operating system ended up far surpassing the Mac in popularity and market share.

After the successful launch of the Macintosh, Jobs became an even bigger celebrity. He lived an eccentric lifestyle and bought an apartment in Manhattan and a mansion in Woodside, California, though he barely furnished either. At Apple, Jobs took control of both the Macintosh and Lisa divisions, leading to many layoffs of Lisa employees. Though Jobs and Sculley were publicly celebrating their partnership, tensions were growing.

 

- Sculley was eager to please Jobs and deferred to him, but failed to realize that Jobs did not like sharing control. Sculley began pushing for more control over how the company was run.

- Jobs was obsessive about even minor details in the Macintosh factory, like the color of the machinery and making sure the floors were spotless. This caused conflicts with the manufacturing director, Matt Carter, who eventually quit. Jobs replaced him with Debi Coleman, who was better able to cater to Jobs's demands. 

- Jobs showed off the factory to his father, who appreciated his son's eye for perfection and craftsmanship. However, a visit from Danielle Mitterrand, the wife of France's president, did not go as well due to her questions about labor practices and Jobs's impatient responses.

- On a trip to Europe, Jobs was obnoxious and rude to his co-workers, and constantly pushed for higher sales projections despite realism. However, Jean-Louis Gassée, Apple's manager in France, was able to stand up to Jobs. Jobs could also turn on the charm when he wanted, impressing French politicians and intellectuals on the trip.

- After initial excitement, Macintosh sales started dropping off due to its lack of power and lack of a hard disk drive. It required a lot more memory to run its graphical user interface than text-based computers of the time. Jobs had cut costs by shipping it with little memory, unlike the Lisa.

In summary, tensions were building between Jobs and Sculley over control of the company. Jobs's perfectionism and erratic behavior was also causing issues, though he remained able to charm people when needed. Meanwhile, the problems with the Macintosh itself were threatening sales.

 

- Steve Jobs threw an elaborate 30th birthday party for himself in 1985 to celebrate becoming an adult. 

- The party featured Ella Fitzgerald singing and had an eclectic guest list including tech leaders, old friends, and venture capitalists.

- Though Jobs received many gifts, he left them behind in his hotel room, in an odd move that fits with his character. Some guests went to Denny's after because they didn't like the fancy food.

- Jobs gave a wistful interview around his 30th birthday, reflecting on getting older, staying creative, and his connection to Apple. He seemed to foresee big changes coming in his life.

- Andy Hertzfeld, an Apple engineer, asked Jobs for a bonus that other engineers had received. Jobs initially refused but then admitted he had actually denied the bonus to Hertzfeld. 

- Hertzfeld said he wouldn't return to Apple on principle if Jobs was withholding the bonus to entice him back. This confrontation contributed to many engineers and executives starting to leave Apple around this time due to frustration with Jobs.

 

- Andy Hertzfeld went on leave from Apple in early 1985 but wanted to return. He met with Jobs and told him the software team was demoralized and key engineers like Burrell Smith were frustrated and ready to leave. But Jobs angrily dismissed Hertzfeld's concerns, saying the Mac team was doing great. Hertzfeld said he wouldn't return if Jobs really believed that, and Jobs said Hertzfeld didn't matter as much as he thought. Hertzfeld left. 

- Burrell Smith also decided to quit, but worried Jobs would talk him out of it. He joked with Hertzfeld that he'd quit by urinating on Jobs's desk. But when he met with Jobs, Jobs had heard about the plan and Smith didn't need to do that. Smith resigned on good terms. Engineer Bruce Horn also resigned but Jobs offered him stock to stay; Horn declined but they hugged.

- Steve Wozniak felt the Apple II group was being ignored so he decided to quietly leave to start a universal remote control company. He gave an interview confirming his frustrations with Apple's direction. Jobs was angry but he and Wozniak put that aside to receive an award at the White House together. However, when Jobs saw sketches for Wozniak's remote at a design firm, he invoked a clause to prevent the firm from working with Wozniak. Wozniak said Jobs had a "hate" for him. Jobs claimed it was just business but others said it was personal. Jobs offered to pay for work already done but demanded the sketches be sent to him or destroyed. The design firm refused.

- Hertzfeld was furious at Jobs for this and wouldn't let him in the house when he came over. Wozniak took the high road but the rift highlighted the growing divide between Jobs and Sculley. They disagreed over pricing and marketing, and resented each other personally - Sculley saw Jobs as rude and selfish, Jobs saw Sculley as clueless about products. Sculley craved Jobs's affection but Jobs became contemptuous of him. The rift was a showdown that had been building.

 

- Steve Jobs and John Sculley's relationship deteriorated as the Macintosh's sales slowed and losses mounted. 
- The Apple board told Sculley to start acting like a CEO and manage Jobs. They told Jobs to focus on fixing the Macintosh division rather than criticizing other parts of the company.
- Jobs's behavior became erratic. He would criticize Sculley and threaten to get him fired, then would become friendly towards him. Sculley finally worked up the courage to tell Jobs he was removing him from managing the Macintosh division.
- The board backed Sculley. They berated Jobs for his poor management and behavior over the past year. Sculley gave the board an ultimatum that they had to choose either him or Jobs as CEO, and they chose Sculley. Sculley agreed to transition Jobs out of the Macintosh role over the next few months.  
- Jobs refused to take no for an answer. He asked Sculley to resign, then asked for more time to prove himself. When Sculley refused, they got into a shouting match over who was the worse manager. Sculley ended up breaking down in tears. 

- The turmoil and power struggle between Jobs and Sculley was coming to a head. Jobs was plotting to get Sculley fired in a coup. But Sculley found out and confronted the board. They again backed Sculley, leaving Jobs without much power or influence at the company he co-founded.

 

- Sculley and the Apple board opposed Jobs's vision and control over the Macintosh division. They wanted the division to serve the whole company's interests, not just sell more Macs.

- Sculley learned that the new Mac and FileServer projects were behind schedule. He criticized the management and marketing of the division. But Jobs pleaded for one more chance to prove himself.

- Sculley went to China for a business trip. In his absence, Jobs plotted to oust Sculley with the help of his allies. But Sculley found out about the coup before leaving and confronted Jobs.

- At an executive meeting, Sculley accused Jobs of trying to throw him out. Jobs bluntly said Sculley was bad for Apple and should leave. Sculley called for a vote of confidence, and the staff sided with Sculley.

- Jobs was devastated and thought he'd have to leave Apple. But his staff urged him to settle down. Sculley also regretted the victory and briefly considered resigning. 

- Sculley's wife angrily confronted Jobs, calling him an "empty hole." Jobs's friend suggested he become a product visionary for a new AppleLabs division. Jobs agreed to meet Sculley to make peace.

- They went for a walk on the Stanford campus. Jobs apologized, and Sculley accepted. They agreed Jobs would run AppleLabs to build new product prototypes, while reporting to Sculley. The truce was uneasy but held for a few more months.

That covers the key events around Jobs's attempted coup against Sculley and their eventual compromise that allowed Jobs to stay at Apple for a little longer. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 

- Jobs spent hours pleading with Sculley to give him an operational role at Apple but Sculley refused. Sculley was willing to let Jobs be a product visionary with his own lab, but Jobs wanted more control and power. 
- Jobs proposed that Sculley become chairman while Jobs would become CEO. Sculley refused, saying only one person can run the company and the board supported him, not Jobs.
- Jobs tried to get Markkula's support to overthrow Sculley but Markkula declined after discussing with the Macintosh team. Markkula said Sculley was in charge and revolt was not the way to go. 
- Sculley told Jobs the board approved his reorganization plan and Jobs would have no operational role. Jobs could remain as chairman but without any real power. 
- Jobs was devastated and despondent. He cried and made phone calls to friends. Murray checked on him and stayed with him most of the night to prevent him from doing anything rash.
- Jobs attended the announcement of the reorganization but sat in the back and stared contemptuously at Sculley. Sculley took away Jobs's company, just as Jobs had said years before about how Polaroid's board had taken away Edwin Land's company.
- Jobs stayed home for days, listening to Bob Dylan songs like "The Times They Are A-Changin'" and "Like a Rolling Stone." Friends came to cheer him up but he complained the situation was even worse than they imagined. He blamed Sculley and said Apple couldn't survive without him, though his new role as chairman was ceremonial.  
- Losing Arthur Rock's support was especially painful. Rock had been like a father to Jobs but chose Sculley over him. Jobs felt deeply rejected and betrayed. 
- Though the board had the right to decide Jobs could not run the company, Jobs felt they made a mistake in how they treated him.

 

- Upon returning from Europe in August 1985, Steve Jobs began exploring starting a new company. He was interested in building a powerful yet personal workstation for researchers and academics. 

- He enlisted a few disgruntled Apple engineers and employees to help, including Bud Tribble, George Crow, Susan Barnes, and Dan'l Lewin. Lewin was especially important because he had connections with universities.

- Jobs presented his plans to the Apple board in September 1985. He told the board he wanted to resign as chairman but hoped to work together, perhaps with Apple licensing software to his new company or even buying a stake in it. The board seemed open to the ideas.

- However, Jobs' team convinced him it was better if they made a clean break from Apple. So Jobs wrote a letter to John Sculley informing him that Tribble, Crow, Barnes, Lewin, and he would all be resigning, effective immediately. 

- Sculley was upset because these were important employees, not low-level as Jobs had suggested. The other execs were also furious at Jobs for betraying Apple. But Sculley asked Jobs to stay on the board.

- Jobs was leaving Apple to start over and build a new company making advanced workstations for higher education. His goal was to build something powerful yet personal.

 

- Steve Jobs left Apple and decided to start his own company, NeXT.
- Apple's CEO John Sculley and the board of directors felt betrayed by Jobs and angry that he was leaving to start a rival company. They threatened legal action against him. 
- Jobs was furious at Apple's management and wanted NeXT to compete directly with Apple's educational market. He gave an interview portraying himself as the victim.
- Steve Wozniak criticized Jobs, saying he couldn't trust his integrity. But Wozniak wished Jobs and NeXT success.
- Jobs pursued his passion for design at NeXT, hiring famous graphic designer Paul Rand to create the company's logo and product design.

 

• Steve Jobs wanted Paul Rand, a famous graphic designer, to create a logo for NeXT. However, Rand worked for IBM at the time, and IBM did not want Rand to work for a competitor. 

• Jobs persistently called IBM executives, including the CEO and Vice Chairman, and eventually convinced them to allow Rand to design a logo for NeXT.

• Rand refused to provide multiple options, instead telling Jobs "I will solve your problem, and you will pay me." Jobs admired this attitude and paid Rand $100,000 to design a single logo.

• Rand designed a logo within two weeks. The logo was a tilted cube, with the word "NeXT" split over two lines inside the cube. Jobs loved it but requested a brighter yellow for the lowercase "e." Rand refused to change it. 

• Jobs wanted Hartmut Esslinger, the industrial designer he worked with at Apple, to design the NeXT computer. However, Esslinger had an exclusive contract with Apple. Jobs somehow convinced Apple to allow Esslinger to work with NeXT.

• Esslinger insisted on having complete creative control, as Rand did. Jobs granted it and decreed that the NeXT computer should be a perfect cube. This made the computer very difficult and expensive to manufacture, but Jobs did not care.

• Jobs was obsessed with perfection and craftsmanship, even for unseen parts inside the computer. He flew to Chicago to force a die caster to redo a part with a tiny imperfection and bought an expensive sanding machine. He insisted the inside of the case be coated in matte black as well. 

• Jobs exhibited an "almost willful lack of tact" and readiness to embarrass others to show he was smarter, according to a journalist who attended a NeXT staff meeting. Jobs was restless, dynamic, and biting, staring at whoever was speaking. His hands were constantly moving.

In summary, Jobs granted almost complete creative freedom and control to Paul Rand and Hartmut Esslinger in designing the logo and physical computer for NeXT. His obsession with perfection, craftsmanship, and willingness to spend money led to manufacturing challenges. His behavior at staff meetings was restless, dynamic, and often humiliating towards others.

 

- Steve Jobs founded NeXT Computer in 1985 after being forced out of Apple. 

- Jobs was obsessive in his design of the company's first headquarters and products. He had the entire interior of the headquarters rebuilt and commissioned elaborate architectural design, like a grand glass staircase. He also worked closely to design the first NeXT computer, with customized chips and a state-of-the-art factory. 

- However, Jobs's perfectionism often led to delays and costs overruns. The computer had many missed ship dates due to technical challenges and constant design revisions. The automated factory cost a lot but didn't speed up development. 

- NeXT struggled to attract outside investment and was burning through funds quickly. Jobs's reality distortion field convinced the company they could ship the computer in 18 months, but that proved impossible. After three years, NeXT was in dire financial straits.

- Ross Perot, the billionaire entrepreneur, saw a PBS documentary on NeXT and Jobs in 1986. He called Jobs and offered to invest, seeing the potential and identifying with Jobs's vision. Perot invested $20 million for a 16% stake in NeXT, valuing the company at $126 million. Perot provided not just funds but also publicity and credibility. He praised NeXT and helped raise its profile. 

- However, NeXT still had not shipped a product after Perot joined, and financial troubles loomed if the computer didn't launch soon. Perot's money only provided a temporary lifeline. NeXT needed to deliver an actual computer.

So in summary, Jobs's pursuit of perfection and vision allowed NeXT to attract money and talent, but Jobs's same instincts and flawed management also caused costly years of delay before the company's computer launched. Perot's intervention saved NeXT for a time, but the company's fate still was far from certain.

 

• Ross Perot hosted a party in 1987 where Steve Jobs first met King Juan Carlos of Spain. Perot facilitated a conversation between Jobs and the king. Jobs ended up selling the king a NeXT computer during their conversation. Perot was a huge proponent of Jobs and helped spread mythical stories about Jobs's life and career. 

• Bill Gates was resistant to Jobs's charisma and persuasiveness. He refused to develop Microsoft software for the NeXT platform, believing it offered nothing unique. During meetings, Gates would outright insult the NeXT machine, angering Jobs. They had a major philosophical difference: Gates believed in compatibility between software and hardware from different companies, while Jobs wanted end-to-end integration of software and hardware.

• Jobs devised a plan to work with IBM and license them the NeXTSTEP operating system in the hopes of countering Microsoft. The deal was struck in 1988 but fell apart shortly after when the main IBM liaison left the company. NeXT did get a small licensing fee out of the deal, but it never amounted to much.

• The launch event for the NeXT computer in October 1988 was highly produced by Jobs, who wanted to prove skeptics wrong. He spent a lot of time preparing every detail of the presentation and rehearsing with the designers. The launch ended up being a blowout event. Though reactions were mixed, the advanced software and object-oriented programming wowed the tech community. The high price of the machine, however, limited its potential.

• Reactions to the NeXT computer were mixed. People were impressed with its advanced software but balked at the high price. There were also issues with the black cube design and lack of compatibility with other systems. The initial failure of NeXT dealt a blow to Jobs's confidence and reputation. He had aimed too far into the future with a machine that was ahead of its time.

That covers the key highlights from the section on Ross Perot, Bill Gates, IBM, and the NeXT computer launch in October 1988. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 Here’s a summary:

• Steve Jobs meticulously planned and rehearsed a dramatic launch event for the NeXT computer. He spent lavishly on the details and hired a famous theater producer to help stage the unveiling. 

• At the event, Jobs showed off the NeXT computer with a live demo. The audience was wowed, though the actual release of the computer would be delayed for over a year. The $6,500 price was higher than expected and disappointing to many.

• Jobs gave “exclusive” cover story access to multiple magazines and ended up appearing on two covers. Some of the coverage called out Jobs’s “need to control events.”

• Reaction to the NeXT computer was muted, especially given its high price and delayed availability. Bill Gates and others were unimpressed, with Gates parodying the launch in an email to his staff. 

• Sales of the NeXT computer were a fraction of the factory’s capacity. The company continued losing money at a fast rate.

• The summary highlights how Jobs’s perfectionism, showmanship, and reality distortion field allowed him to create a sense of excitement around the launch, even if the actual product and its reception were disappointing relative to expectations. The coverage and quotes illustrate both the power of Jobs’s persona and presentations as well as the shortcomings of the NeXT computer and company.

 

- Steve Jobs visited Lucasfilm's computer graphics division in 1985 and wanted to buy it. However, the division's leaders Ed Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith wanted to find an investor rather than an outright buyer.
- They reached a deal in 1986. Jobs purchased 70% of the company for $10 million and invested another $5 million. He let Catmull and Smith run it but provided oversight and ideas. 
- The company was named Pixar. Its main product was the Pixar Image Computer, which sold for $125,000 and was used by animators, designers, the medical industry, and intelligence agencies. Jobs wanted to sell a cheaper version for $30,000 to reach mainstream consumers, but it was not successful. 
- Pixar also sold rendering software called Reyes and later RenderMan, which Jobs wanted to market to mainstream consumers. However, it was most useful for animators and was used by Disney. 
- Pixar's animation group, led by John Lasseter, originally just existed to demonstrate Pixar's technology. Lasseter was passionate about animation and eventually turned it into a successful business. 
- In summary, although Jobs's goal of reaching mainstream consumers largely failed, Pixar found success selling to animators, professionals, and Disney. The animation business, which Jobs initially saw as secondary, eventually became Pixar's primary focus.

 

John Lasseter joined Pixar in 1984 and bonded with Steve Jobs over their mutual passion for design and artistry. Lasseter was an animator who wanted to bring a high level of quality to his craft, but he had been frustrated working at Disney. Jobs and Catmull recruited him to come to Pixar, which was then a division of Lucasfilm. 

In 1986, Lasseter produced an animated short called Luxo Jr. to demonstrate Pixar’s technology at SIGGRAPH, the big computer graphics conference. The film ended up being a huge hit and getting a standing ovation. It showed Jobs what Pixar could potentially achieve by blending art and technology. Luxo Jr. was nominated for an Academy Award, and Jobs became committed to producing an animated short each year to show off Pixar’s skills, even though there was little business rationale for doing so.

Not all of Jobs’s relationships at Pixar were good, however. He clashed frequently with Alvy Ray Smith, who had cofounded the company with Ed Catmull. Smith had a big personality and saw Jobs as an ego-driven bully. Their confrontation eventually led to screaming matches and Smith resigning. 

Pixar was struggling financially, losing money on its hardware, software, and animation businesses. Jobs had to put more money in, and he also ordered deep layoffs without any severance pay. Catmull and others were able to reinstate a modest severance plan. Pixar tried to work with Intel, but Jobs’s style did not mesh well with Andy Grove and other executives there. Pixar did produce some software products for consumers, including Showplace for making 3-D images, but the products were too complicated for most mainstream users and could not compete with simpler tools from Adobe.

So in summary, Lasseter’s artistic talents and Jobs’s patronage of them were bright spots, but Pixar was struggling mightily as a business. Jobs’s style frequently aggravated relationships with colleagues like Alvy Ray Smith and partners like Intel. The company’s future was very precarious during this period.

 

- In 1982, Jobs met the folksinger Joan Baez through her sister and had a romantic relationship with her for a few years, even though they were very different. Jobs was in his late 20s, Baez in her early 40s. Jobs showed Baez the first Macintosh and gave her an Apple II and a Mac. Though he could be romantic at times, Baez found him puzzling. He cared about her but was detached. He admired her connection to Bob Dylan but wouldn't buy her an expensive dress. Their relationship ended after about 3 years as they wanted different things; Jobs wanted children, Baez did not. They remained friends.

- When Jobs was 31, his mother Clara was dying of lung cancer. He spent time with her and asked her questions he had never asked before, like whether she was a virgin when she married his father. She told him she had been married before, to a man who died in the war. She gave him more details about his adoption.

- Around this time, Jobs succeeded in tracking down his biological mother, Joanne Schieble Simpson, who had put him up for adoption. His search for her had started in the early 1980s. He eventually located her and wrote her a heartfelt letter, saying he didn't want anything from her and just wanted to meet her. She invited Jobs to come to New York, and he did. Their first meeting was emotional, and they felt an immediate connection. Simpson told him he had a younger sister, Mona Simpson, who also lived in New York.

That's the summary of this part of the chapter, covering Jobs's relationship with Joan Baez, learning details about his adoption and birth parents from his mother Clara before she died, locating his biological mother Joanne, and meeting his younger sister Mona for the first time.

 

• Steve Jobs hired detectives to find his biological parents but they were unsuccessful. 

• Jobs then noticed his biological mother's name, Joanne Schieble, on his birth certificate and called her doctor. The doctor claimed his records were destroyed but then sent Jobs a letter on his death revealing Joanne's identity.

• Jobs met his biological mother, Joanne Simpson, and sister, Mona Simpson. Joanne expressed regret for giving him up for adoption. Jobs reassured her she did the right thing and was glad he wasn't aborted. Mona and Jobs became very close.

• Mona had been trying to find their biological father, Abdulfattah "John" Jandali. She eventually tracked him down managing a restaurant. Jandali told her he and Joanne had a son before her that they had given up for adoption. Mona realized he was referring to Steve Jobs.

• Mona told Jobs about meeting their father. Jobs remembered Jandali from the restaurant but chose not to contact him out of fear of blackmail or public exposure. Jandali later learned of his relationship to Jobs online but Jobs never agreed to meet him.

• Jobs remained close with his adoptive parents but only told his adoptive father, Paul Jobs, about his search for his biological parents. Jobs didn't want his adoptive parents to feel he didn't consider them his "real" parents.

• Mona based a novel "A Regular Guy" on Jobs. While Jobs could be critical of Mona, he was happy to have her as a sister and helped support her as she tried to become an author.

 

- Steve Jobs's biological father, Abdulfattah “John” Jandali, was Syrian. He met Jobs's biological mother, Joanne Simpson, when they were both students at the University of Wisconsin, but Jandali ended up leaving Simpson before Jobs was born.  

- Jobs showed little interest in connecting with his biological father. Though Jandali and Simpson reconnected later in life and Simpson visited Jobs a few times, Jobs largely ignored Jandali. Jobs did have a friendly relationship with Simpson, though her visits could be emotional.

- Jobs's daughter Lisa Brennan had a difficult childhood. For the first few years of her life, Jobs barely visited her. However, as Lisa got older, Jobs took more of an interest in her life. He would occasionally take walks with her, go rollerblading, and take her on business trips. However, their relationship remained turbulent, and they would often go months without speaking.

- Jobs tended to fall intensely in love, but these relationships were often tumultuous. In the early 1980s, Jobs dated an undergraduate named Jennifer Egan for a year. He frequently visited Egan and spoke with her for hours on the phone. They discussed Jobs's belief that one should avoid becoming too attached to material objects. However, like many of Jobs's relationships, his relationship with Egan ultimately ended.

 

- Steve Jobs told his girlfriend Jennifer Egan that consumer desires were unhealthy and that one needs to develop nonattachment to material things to attain enlightenment. However, Jobs's pride in the products he created overcame this sensibility. 

- Jobs dated Tina Redse from 1985 to 1989. Redse came from a troubled family, like Jobs, and they connected over their painful childhoods. However, Redse found Jobs self-centered and their relationship was tempestuous. Redse wanted to get married but ultimately decided she could not handle Jobs's unkindness and lack of empathy.

- After breaking up with Redse, Jobs missed her and continued to pine for her at times, even after marrying. Redse regretted that she and Jobs could not make their relationship work, but agreed they were not meant to be together.

- By the time Jobs and Redse broke up, there was a clear type of woman that would suit Jobs: intelligent but unpretentious, able to stand up to him but rise above turmoil, educated and independent but willing to make accommodations for family, down-to-earth with a touch of the spiritual, able to manage Jobs but secure in herself, and ideally a beautiful blonde who liked organic food.

- In 1991, Jobs met Laurene Powell, who matched this type. They married and had three children together: Reed, Erin, and Eve. Laurene was able to give Jobs a stable family life despite his demanding work schedule and quirks.

 

- In 1989, Steve Jobs met Laurene Powell, a graduate student at Stanford Business School, at a lecture he gave there. 
- They hit it off and went to dinner that night, talking for four hours. They began dating soon after. 
- Friends described their relationship as passionate but turbulent. Jobs would sometimes lavish Powell with intense attention and affection, then become distant and focused only on work. 
- On New Year's Eve 1989, they got into an argument at dinner and Powell spent the night at her friend's apartment. The next morning, Jobs showed up with flowers and asked Powell's friend for permission to marry Powell. Although she gave her blessing, Jobs did not propose for several more months.  
- In September 1990, Powell moved out, frustrated with waiting for a proposal. A month later, Jobs proposed. 
- In December 1990, Jobs and Powell vacationed in Hawaii, where Jobs again declared his desire to marry Powell. Soon after, Powell became pregnant. 
- Despite the pregnancy, Jobs still had doubts about marriage and even briefly pursued his ex-girlfriend Tina Redse again. However, he ultimately decided to marry Powell.
- They married on March 18, 1991.

In summary, Laurene Powell and Steve Jobs had a passionate but stormy early relationship. Although Jobs proposed several times, he also experienced doubts and pursued other relationships. Powell's pregnancy was a factor in ultimately convincing Jobs to follow through with marriage. After various ups and downs, they married in March 1991.

 Based on the passage, Steve Jobs should marry Laurene Powell.

Here is a summary of the key reasons:

1. Laurene Powell shared Jobs’ interest in natural and healthy living. She had worked for Odwalla, the juice company, and started her own organic food company. This shared value in healthy living would provide a strong foundation for their relationship.

2. Laurene Powell was able to withstand Jobs’ difficult personality. Friends said she was “armor-plated” and could “sustain his ups and downs and tempestuous personality.” Their marriage endured despite his emotional turbulence, showing her ability to handle his temperament. 

3. Jobs respected and loved Powell. The passage says “He liked her, he loved her, he respected her, and he was comfortable with her.” While his relationship with Tina Redse was more mystical, his relationship with Powell was more solid and grounded. 

4. Powell complemented Jobs and provided stability. She was described as “a sensible anchor for his life.” She was not as neurotic as Tina Redse and could engage Jobs intellectually while also sustaining him.

5. They shared lifestyle values regarding family and community. They chose to live in a family-friendly neighborhood and wanted their kids to be able to walk to friends’ houses. They valued community and interactions with neighbors.

6. Powell tolerated Jobs’ demanding design sensibilities. The passage describes how renovating and furnishing their home took an extremely long time because of Jobs’ perfectionism regarding design. Powell was patient through this long process.

In summary, Laurene Powell shared Jobs’ values, complemented his personality, loved and sustained him, and tolerated his demanding design preferences. Based on these reasons, Powell was the right choice for Jobs to marry.

 

- Steve Jobs and his family debated for two weeks about what was most important in purchasing a new washer and dryer set. They ultimately chose an expensive Miele set from Germany that Jobs loved.

- The only art Jobs had in his home was a large Ansel Adams mural print that he had restored after it was damaged. His house was very modest, unlike Bill Gates's huge mansion. Jobs had no live-in help and didn't even lock the door during the day.

- Burrell Smith, who worked with Jobs at Apple, developed schizophrenia and harassed Jobs for a while by throwing rocks through his windows and leaving threatening letters. Jobs tried to help Smith, even paying to get him released from jail at one point.

- Lisa Brennan-Jobs, Steve's daughter with Chrisann Brennan, moved in with Steve and Laurene during her 8th grade year due to issues at her mom's house. Chrisann would sometimes yell at them from the yard. Living with Steve was tough, but Lisa flourished in high school, co-editing the school newspaper.

- Lisa's relationship with Steve continued to be up and down through college at Harvard and beyond. They would frequently argue over small things and Steve would sometimes cut off her funding. But they also had some good times, like when Lisa sang at a benefit concert Steve attended.

- Chrisann, Lisa's mom, sold a house that Steve had bought for her and Lisa. When Chrisann later needed money for medical issues, Steve refused to help. Lisa didn't speak to Steve for years as a result.

- The novel A Regular Guy was based on Steve Jobs and Lisa's relationship. It depicts Jobs's secret generosity toward a friend who faced health issues.

 

- Pixar’s main customer was Disney, which licensed their animation software. 
- Jeffrey Katzenberg, head of Disney’s film division, invited Jobs to discuss partnering on an animated film.
- Katzenberg admired John Lasseter and had tried to hire him. He now proposed that Disney and Pixar work together on a film.
- Both Katzenberg and Jobs were strong-willed and at times abrasive leaders. The negotiations took months as they argued over terms. 
- Jobs refused to give Disney rights to Pixar’s 3D animation technology. But he conceded that Disney would own the film and characters, control the video rights and sequels, and could cancel the film at any time for a penalty.
- The movie Lasseter proposed was Toy Story, based on the idea that a toy’s purpose is to be played with by a child. So the toys would feel existential fear of being replaced. 
- The film would pair an old favorite toy, Woody, with a new flashy toy, Buzz Lightyear. Their adventures would revolve around the drama of their toy owner Andy outgrowing them.

So in summary, after a contentious negotiation, Jobs and Katzenberg made a deal for Disney to work with Pixar on Toy Story. The film was based on an idea by John Lasseter about the secret lives of toys.

 

- Pixar's first film Toy Story initially had a problematic plot that Disney executives did not like. They asked for major revisions to make the main character Woody crueler and edgier. 
- Pixar stopped production and reworked the story to make Woody a wise and sympathetic leader instead. They screened the new version for Disney, who approved it. But the revisions had added to costs.
- Steve Jobs fought with Disney's Jeffrey Katzenberg over the film's increased budget. Ed Catmull helped negotiate a compromise. 
- As Toy Story progressed, Jobs became increasingly excited about its potential. He decided Pixar should go public the week the movie opened, even though investors were skeptical.
- Toy Story premiered in November 1995. Disney organized an event for celebrities, but Jobs held his own separate premiere for Silicon Valley figures. 
- Toy Story ended up being a massive blockbuster hit, both commercially and critically. It made over $360 million at the box office. Critics universally praised the film. 
- The success of Toy Story raised questions about the relationship between Pixar and Disney. Would they be true partners, or would Pixar just act as an animation contractor for Disney? Managing the egos of Jobs and Disney's Michael Eisner would determine the answer.

 

- After the initial excitement, NeXT's computer failed commercially. It was incompatible with other systems, had little software, and couldn't attract many customers. 

- NeXT tried to reposition itself as a "personal workstation" company, but it couldn't compete with fast-growing Sun Microsystems. NeXT's revenues were small compared to Sun's.

- IBM abandoned its plan to license NeXT's software. So in 1992, Jobs agreed to license NeXT's operating system to run on other computers. This went against his belief in integrated hardware and software, but he had no choice.

- Jobs had to lay off more than half of NeXT's workforce and sell the factory. The company became focused just on licensing its operating system.

- By the mid-1990s, Jobs was disillusioned with the PC industry, which was dominated by Microsoft with little innovation. He said "Windows won" and the desktop market was in "the dark ages."

- After Jobs left Apple, the company initially did well by dominating desktop publishing. But then Sculley made some bad decisions and predictions. He said Apple would never be a consumer products company, but that's exactly what it became. 

- Jobs was angry at Sculley's decisions and felt contemptuous toward him. Sculley later admitted his mistakes, but by then the damage was done. Apple declined as Windows gained more popularity.

- Apple's decline during this period reinforced Jobs' belief in integrated hardware and software, not just licensing software to various hardware makers. That belief would shape his future decisions upon returning to Apple.

In summary, this was a difficult period for Jobs. NeXT struggled, Apple declined after he left, and the PC industry was dominated by Microsoft. But these experiences would shape his approach when he eventually reunited with Apple.

 

• Steve Jobs was ousted from Apple in 1985 after clashing with John Sculley, then CEO. Sculley focused too much on profits and not enough on innovation, according to Jobs. This led to a decline in Apple's market share. 

• In the early 1990s, Apple's market share fell steadily. In 1996, CEO Michael Spindler tried but failed to sell the company. He was replaced by Gil Amelio.

• Amelio realized Apple needed a new operating system. He first looked at buying Be, Jean-Louis Gassée's company, but negotiations fell through. Amelio then considered licensing Windows NT or Solaris.

• Meanwhile, Jobs' company NeXT also needed help and was looking for an acquirer. A NeXT marketer called Apple, leading to discussions between the two companies.

• Jobs called Amelio and asked to meet. He made a pitch for Apple buying NeXT. Jobs wanted to sell the entire company, not just its software.

• Jobs and Ellison discussed the possibility of Apple buying NeXT as a way for Jobs to regain control. Ellison pointed out that Jobs didn't need to sell the company to become CEO.

• In summary, Apple needed an operating system, and NeXT needed an acquirer. Together, they made a natural match, which eventually led to Apple buying NeXT and the return of Steve Jobs to Apple.

 

• Gil Amelio, the CEO of Apple, decided to buy NeXT to get its operating system and bring Steve Jobs back into the fold. 
• Jobs initially resisted joining Apple as an active full-time leader. He told Amelio he was tired and not thinking clearly. He just wanted to be an "advisor to the chairman."
• The deal was announced in December 1996. Amelio described Jobs's new role as merely a part-time advisor, but Jobs ended up coming onstage to loud applause from the audience. 
• Jobs told a reporter he had no plans to take over Apple, saying he had a family and Pixar and limited time. But his friend Larry Ellison and Bill Gates predicted that Jobs would eventually take over. 
• Gates was very critical of the decision to buy NeXT, telling Amelio that Jobs knew nothing about technology or engineering. Gates said Jobs was just a "super salesman" and that it was stupid to buy his "garbage."
• Jobs drove to Pixar after the announcement and told people there he was going to still be president of Pixar but spend some time helping at Apple. The Pixar team was actually happy to have a little less of Jobs's intense focus and micromanaging.

So in summary, Jobs initially was hesitant to return to Apple full-time but went along with being an "advisor" while also staying on as president of Pixar. But most observers thought it was inevitable he would take over leadership of Apple.

 

- Steve Jobs returned to Apple officially as an advisor in January 1997 at age 41. Although he joined as an advisor, he began asserting himself in personnel areas to protect his former NeXT colleagues. 
- Jobs found Apple's CEO Gil Amelio to be a "bozo." Amelio made a terrible impression during his bizarre and rambling Macworld keynote address in January 1997. 
- Jobs put executives he trusted into top roles at Apple, including Avie Tevanian to head software and Jon Rubinstein to run hardware.
- Jobs hated Apple's Newton handheld device and told Amelio to kill it, but Amelio refused. Amelio later announced plans to spin off the Newton division.  
- By February 1997, it was clear that Jobs was gaining power over Amelio behind the scenes. Many Silicon Valley observers and Jobs's own confidants said Jobs aimed to replace Amelio to "ensure the survival of 'his company.'"
- At Apple's 1997 shareholder meeting, Amelio had to explain poor results for the previous quarter. The directors started realizing Amelio may need to be replaced.

In summary, after rejoining Apple in early 1997, the 40-something Jobs quickly began exerting control over the company's leadership and direction again. His increasing power and Amelio's weaknesses set the stage for Jobs to soon take over.

 

- Apple's sales plummeted 30% in the last quarter of 1996 compared to a year earlier. Shareholders were furious.

- CEO Gil Amelio handled a shareholder meeting poorly and didn't inspire confidence. Board chair Ed Woolard called Steve Jobs, who said Amelio was the worst CEO he'd ever seen. 

- Larry Ellison again floated the idea of buying a majority stake in Apple and installing Jobs as CEO. Amelio was angry but Jobs didn't quash the speculation.

- The press turned against Amelio, with several calling for his resignation or removal. 

- Although Jobs and Amelio had dinner to celebrate their new deal, Jobs soon betrayed Amelio by selling 1.5 million shares of Apple stock without telling him, despite promising not to sell for at least 6 months. When Amelio confronted him, Jobs lied about it.

- Amelio realized Jobs was plotting against him to push him out as CEO. Fred Anderson, Apple's CFO, told Ed Woolard that Apple's situation was dire and the odds of surviving were low if Amelio remained CEO but higher if Jobs took over.

- At a board meeting without Amelio, Woolard said there was a 60% chance of Apple surviving if they removed Amelio and convinced Jobs to become CEO, 40% if they fired Amelio but couldn't get Jobs, and 10% chance if Amelio stayed. The board started to turn against Amelio.

 

- Apple's board of directors fired CEO Gil Amelio and asked Steve Jobs to return as CEO.

- Jobs was initially reluctant to return as CEO. He wanted to spend time with his family and was CEO of Pixar. However, he said he would be an advisor to help Apple hire a new CEO.

- The board went ahead and fired Amelio. Jobs then told Amelio he had nothing to do with the firing, though he had advised the board on it. Jobs suggested Amelio take time off.

- When Jobs returned to Apple, he immediately took control as an active advisor. He asked what was wrong with Apple and declared "The products suck!" He said there was no excitement anymore.

- Jobs focused on stopping top employees from leaving. He wanted to reprice their stock options, which had become worthless, to make them valuable again. The board resisted this unusual move but Jobs insisted it had to be done quickly.

- Jobs told the board if they didn't support this decision, he would not return on Monday. He said he had many more difficult decisions coming and needed their support.

- In summary, Jobs was reluctant to return as CEO but seized control as an "advisor" as soon as he came back. His first moves were to determine the problems at Apple, stop employee departures, and push the board to make quick and meaningful changes to support a turnaround.

 Here’s a summary:

• Steve Jobs was still angry at the Apple board for refusing to give top executives valuable stock options. He told board chairman Ed Woolard that the board members all needed to resign, except Woolard, or else Jobs would quit. The board acquiesced, asking only that Woolard and one other member stay on. 

• Jobs personally went to original Apple investor Mike Markkula’s house to ask him to resign from the board. Although their relationship had been rocky, Jobs still cared for Markkula. Markkula agreed to resign and advised Jobs that for Apple to last, it needed to reinvent itself.

• Jobs recruited new board members, including Larry Ellison, Bill Campbell, and Jerry York. He rejected other candidates, like Meg Whitman. Jobs made sure the new board members were loyal to him.

• In August 1997, Jobs gave the keynote at Macworld Boston to enthusiastic crowds. He emphasized “we” and “I” instead of “they” when talking about Apple, signaling he was in control of the company. He said Apple had been struggling because it lacked a good strategy, but now Apple would “think different” again and build tools for creative people. The crowd went wild, seeing that Jobs was truly back to lead Apple.

• Overall, in the summer of 1997, Jobs took control of Apple, ousted most of the board, and recruited new members who were loyal to him. His keynote at Macworld showed how he was ready to reinvigorate the company. Apple was poised for a turnaround under Jobs’s leadership.

 

- In August 1997, Steve Jobs announced a shocking partnership with Microsoft at Macworld. The two companies had been engaged in a bitter feud for a decade. 

- Jobs realized Apple needed help from partners to survive. He called Bill Gates and asked for a commitment to continue developing Office for Mac and an investment in Apple. Gates agreed.

- The announcement of the deal initially met with boos and hisses from the audience, especially when Jobs announced Internet Explorer would be the default Mac browser. But the mood improved when Gates said Office for Mac would be better than Windows versions.

- However, projecting a giant image of Gates on a screen behind Jobs was seen as a mistake that made Apple and Jobs appear small. Both Jobs and Gates were embarrassed by it in retrospect. 

- Jobs told the audience they had to "let go" of the notion of Apple winning meaning Microsoft lost. He said they should be grateful to Microsoft for continuing to develop Office for Mac.

- The Microsoft deal and Jobs's return provided a boost for Apple. Its stock price went up 33% in a day, adding $830 million in market capitalization. Apple was revived from the brink of death.

- In July 1997, Lee Clow and his ad team at TBWA\Chiat\Day were asked by Jobs to pitch for Apple's advertising business after Amelio resigned. Jobs wanted to prove Apple "still stands for something special." 

- Clow usually didn't pitch for accounts but agreed to do so for Jobs out of love for Apple. His team came up with the "Think Different" concept, which Jobs said was "ten times better than anything" from other agencies. The story of Clow agreeing to pitch made Jobs cry years later.

 Here’s a summary:

- Jobs wanted an ad campaign to remind people what Apple stood for - creativity and individualism. The “Think Different” campaign aimed to celebrate creative individuals and “the crazy ones” who push the human race forward. 

- The original text for the campaign read: “Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers...” Jobs helped refine the text, adding lines like “They push the human race forward.” 

- They considered various famous people to narrate the commercial, including Robin Williams and Maya Angelou, but ended up choosing actor Richard Dreyfuss. They also considered having Jobs do the narration, but he thought it should focus on Apple, not him. 

- The print ads featured iconic black-and-white photos of famous “rebels” and creative thinkers like Einstein, Gandhi, Lennon, and Picasso. Jobs was personally involved in selecting the perfect photos. He called various people, including John Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono, to obtain the right pictures.

- The ad campaign affirmed Jobs’ vision of Apple as a brand for creative rebels and counterculture thinkers. Very few companies could get away with associating their brand with Gandhi and Einstein. The campaign allowed people to feel like rebellious innovators just by using Apple products.

- Jobs met with his marketing team every Wednesday for three hours to craft messaging and review every new ad, print piece, and billboard. He shared the passion he had for upcoming Apple products with the marketing team to infuse the ads with emotion and excitement.

- In September 1997, Jobs officially took over as interim CEO of Apple, replacing Fred Anderson who had held the role for the previous ten weeks after Gil Amelio was ousted.

 

- In 1997, Steve Jobs took over as the interim CEO of Apple, which got abbreviated as iCEO. He took no salary and signed no contract. 

- His actions were not tentative. He wanted to get Apple back to focusing on great products, marketing and distribution. The company had drifted away from the basics.

- Running both Pixar and Apple was exhausting for Jobs. He said this period nearly killed him due to the grueling schedule and developing kidney stones. But he realized Apple needed him, so he decided to stay.

- There was a debate about whether Apple should license its operating system to other computer makers, the way Microsoft licensed Windows. Wozniak and others advocated for it, but Jobs resisted it. He preferred integrating hardware and software.

- When Jobs returned to Apple, he made killing the Macintosh clones a priority. He stopped allowing them to use new versions of the Mac OS, making their products less competitive. He eventually paid $100 million to buy out Power Computing's license. Jobs said licensing the OS was "the dumbest thing in the world" and cut into Apple's sales.

- One of Jobs's strengths was focus. Upon his return, he reviewed Apple's product line and cut lots of products, reducing them from dozens of confusing models down to a few clear choices. He banned PowerPoint presentations during the review, preferring open discussions. The review showed how unfocused Apple had become, churning out many products to satisfy retailers rather than out of a clear vision. 

- Jobs slashed models and product variants to simplify Apple's line. "What are the 10 products you want to see Apple make?" he asked one manager. Focus and simplicity were key principles for Jobs.

 

- Jonathan Ive was the head of Apple's design team, but was planning to quit in 1997 due to the company's focus on profits over design. However, when Steve Jobs returned and announced that the goal was to make great products, Ive decided to stay. 

- Ive grew up in London. His father was a silversmith who taught design. Ive attended Newcastle Polytechnic and worked at a design firm, where he designed products like an award-winning ATM machine. He was hired by Apple in 1992, but was unhappy under CEO Gil Amelio, who cared little for design.

- When Jobs took over, he initially looked for an outside world-class designer. But he bonded with Ive over a tour of the design studio. They began meeting regularly and developed a close relationship, with Jobs often dropping by Ive's studio. Jobs said Ive understood Apple at its core better than anyone, and that no one could tell Ive what to do except Jobs himself. 

- Ive and Jobs worked closely together to conceptualize many of Apple's products. While Ive enjoyed analyzing the details of a design, Jobs was more intuitive. But they complemented each other well. Under their leadership, design became central to Apple's success.

- Apple's focus on design, enforced by Jobs and executed by Ive, saved the company. In 1998, Apple made a $309 million profit after multiple years of huge losses. Jobs and Ive forged one of the greatest design partnerships of their time.

 

- Jony Ive and Steve Jobs shared a passion for design and simplicity. 
- They aimed to simplify products by deeply understanding their essence and removing unnecessary parts. 
- At Apple, design drove engineering, not the reverse. Jobs and Ive would conceive of products and the engineers had to make components fit. 
- The design studio at Apple was a tightly controlled area where Jobs and Ive could meet, review product models, and refine designs. 
- Jobs loved visiting the studio, sitting at the tables, and playing with product models to get a sense of products in the pipeline and how they fit together. 
- Much of the design process involved an iterative conversation as Jobs and Ive walked around, discussed, and refined the models. They did not like rigid design reviews and presentations.
- Jobs and Ive obsessed over many details, including the design of product packaging. They aimed to make unpacking an Apple product a special experience.

The key elements are:

1) A shared design philosophy of simplicity, focus on essence 
2) Design-driven product development process
3) Tight collaboration in the design studio 
4) An iterative, flowing conversation-based creative process 
5) Attention to details including packaging and the overall product experience

 

- Jony Ive, Apple's chief designer, conceived of the iMac design with a colorful and playful plastic casing. It conveyed a sense of simplicity and approachability. The see-through casing made the components inside visible, showing the engineering care. The recessed handle added to the friendly feel, though it was expensive to manufacture. Steve Jobs insisted on keeping it despite the costs. 

- The initial plan was to make a "network computer" without a hard drive, but the CFO recommended adding a disk drive to make it a full desktop computer. Steve Jobs and Jon Rubinstein decided not to include a floppy disk drive, anticipating its obsolescence.

- Jobs was initially unimpressed with Ive's foam models but eventually loved one of them. He began carrying it around to show others. The design was radically different from existing computers.

- The manufacturing process for the translucent, colorful cases was complex and the cases cost over $60 each, three times the typical amount. But Jobs didn't ask for cost-benefit analyses. He just loved the design.

- When the design was shown to the ad team, they were shocked but couldn't say so. They suggested the name "iMac," which Jobs eventually accepted.

- As the deadline loomed, Jobs erupted in anger at the slow progress, berating the team. But the iMac was completed just in time. At the rehearsal, however, Jobs fumed over the CD tray drive, demanding a slot drive instead. He nearly canceled the launch but was persuaded to go ahead with a promise to switch to a slot drive soon. 

- A video for the launch featuring Jony Ive had to be fixed at the last minute. But otherwise the launch went well, highlighting the new colorful iMacs to great fanfare.

The key points are that the radical iMac design was conceived under Jony Ive and pushed ahead by Steve Jobs despite significant costs and manufacturing challenges. Jobs's demanding nature caused eruptions of anger but also resulted in a game-changing product that brought Apple back to prominence.

 

- Steve Jobs was preparing for the launch of the new iMac in 1998. He was obsessive in rehearsals to make sure the show and product unveiling were spectacular. 
- Jobs invited Steve Wozniak, Mike Markkula, and Mike Scott, although he had been estranged from them. He acknowledged their importance in starting Apple. 
- When Jobs unveiled the iMac, he showed how computers looked currently (beige boxes) and then revealed the translucent, colorful iMac. He said it looked like it was from "a good planet. A planet with better designers." 
- The iMac was a hit. It was friendly, appealing, and brought in many new customers, especially those who had never bought a computer before or were Windows users.
- Bill Gates dismissed the iMac, saying that Windows PCs could catch up just by adding color. Jobs said Gates did not understand that the iMac was appealing not due to fashion or surface appearance alone. 
- The iMac came in five colors, thanks to Jony Ive. This kind of decision would have taken months at another company, but Jobs decided on it in half an hour.
- Jobs pushed to move the iMac from a CD tray to a slot-drive, despite arguments that the slot-drive would soon be behind technologically. Jobs insisted, saying it was what he wanted.

 

• When Steve Jobs returned to Apple as CEO, he showed that he could be an effective leader and manager in addition to being a visionary. He focused the company by cutting excess inventory, reducing the number of products, and simplifying the operating system software. 

• Jobs adopted an aggressive and demanding management style. He would frequently berate people, but this motivated them to perform at their best. Tim Cook, who became Chief Operating Officer, was able to achieve Jobs's demanding standards through his operational rigor and discipline. Under Cook's leadership, Apple's operations became very efficient.

• Cook reduced the number of suppliers, forced them to cut deals to keep Apple's business, moved many next to Apple's plants, and cut the number of warehouses from 19 to 10. This reduced inventory from 2 months to 6 days' worth, allowing Apple to use the latest components.

• Inspired by Sony, Jobs decided he wanted the bonding and unity that company uniforms created. Despite resistance, he asked designer Issey Miyake to design a vest for Apple employees. Jobs then began wearing Miyake's black turtlenecks regularly himself.

• Though autocratic, Jobs fostered a culture of collaboration at Apple through frequent meetings and by insisting different departments work together. This "deep collaboration" and "concurrent engineering" allowed for the integrated design of Apple's products. Jobs would have job candidates meet with multiple top executives, not just managers in a specific department.

• In summary, Jobs became an effective manager and operations-focused CEO upon his return to Apple, not just a visionary. With Tim Cook's help, he built a collaborative culture and efficient, integrated operations that produced innovative products.

 

- Steve Jobs was very particular about hiring the best people, whom he called "A players." He said that A players like to work with other A players. His goal was to avoid filling the company with mediocre talent. 

- The hiring process at Apple was intimidating because Jobs was demanding, but he had an eye for talent. He once hired a designer on the spot after seeing a quick demo of an idea the designer had. 

- Jobs's experiences at NeXT helped him mature, but he was still prone to occasional irrational or incorrect statements. However, his eye for detail meant he sometimes noticed small things others missed.

- Ed Woolard, Jobs's mentor on Apple's board, spent over two years convincing Jobs to drop "interim" from his CEO title. Jobs finally did so in 2000. Rather than accepting a stock option grant, Jobs asked for an airplane so he could take his family on vacation. The board gave him a Gulfstream jet.

- In January 2000, Jobs unveiled OS X, which incorporated some of the software from NeXT. Although critics noted Apple didn't adopt the entire NeXT OS, OS X provided features the Mac desperately needed. Its release marked the moment Jobs fully incorporated himself back into Apple.

- When Jobs announced he would drop "interim" from his CEO title, the crowd at Macworld gave him a standing ovation. Although Jobs showed humility, the fans were thrilled at the news.

In summary, by early 2000, Jobs had matured and was fully committed to Apple again. Under his leadership, Apple released OS X, which revitalized the Macintosh. His demanding nature and high standards continued to shape Apple into a company filled with "A players."

 

• Steve Jobs wanted to control the customer experience of buying an Apple product, including the retail experience. However, at the time most computers were sold through big chains where the staff were not knowledgeable about Apple's products. 

• Jobs started secretly planning to open a string of Apple retail stores. He hired Ron Johnson from Target to develop the retail strategy.

• Jobs and Johnson toured a shopping mall to determine what they liked and didn't like. They decided the stores should be in high-traffic, expensive locations and should have only one entrance. The store layout should be simple and allow people to try the products.

• The board was hesitant about the retail store plan but approved a trial of four stores. Millard Drexler, the CEO of Gap, supported Jobs.

• Jobs and Johnson created a prototype store in a warehouse near Apple's campus. They spent months refining the layout and experience. Jobs frequently brought friends like Drexler and Larry Ellison to get input.

• Drexler suggested making the store layout simpler and less chopped up. Jobs agreed that simplicity and lack of distractions were key. 

• Just before opening the stores, Johnson realized they had organized the stores around product lines, rather than the idea of the computer as the hub for digital experiences. They reorganized the stores at the last minute.

• In summary, Steve Jobs was intensely focused on controlling the customer experience, down to the smallest details. The prototype store allowed him to refine the retail environment to match Apple's brand.

 

• Ron Johnson, Apple's Senior Vice President of Retail, came up with the idea of reorganizing the layout of the Apple stores around activities that people did with the products instead of just the products themselves. For example, having a movie area focused on editing home videos. 

• When Johnson told Steve Jobs about this idea, Jobs angrily rejected it, saying they had spent six months designing the stores and it was too late to change them. However, on the drive to the store, Jobs realized Johnson was right. He told the team Johnson's new vision and said they would redesign the stores, even though it would delay the rollout.

• Most experts and analysts thought the Apple stores would fail. However, when the first store opened in 2001, it was very successful. By 2004, the stores were making $1.2 billion in revenue. 

• Jobs was involved in every detail of the store designs. He focused particularly on the staircases and insisted the stone flooring use authentic Italian Pietra Serena sandstone.

• The "Genius Bar" was Ron Johnson's idea. Although Jobs initially rejected the name "genius bar," he soon told Apple's lawyers to go ahead and trademark it.

• The Fifth Avenue glass cube store in New York embodied many of Jobs's signatures: a cube shape, a signature staircase, high-tech glass, and a minimalist design. It was an immediate success and became Apple's most profitable store.

• Although Johnson originally thought the 18 glass panels on the side of the Fifth Avenue store looked better than 4 larger panels would, Jobs was interested in using new technology to install 4 larger glass panels. Even as he was sick, Jobs was envisioning ambitious new store designs.  

• By 2011, 10 years after opening, there were 326 Apple stores with the largest in London and Tokyo. Although the stores only accounted for 15% of Apple's revenue directly, they helped build buzz and brand awareness for Apple.

That covers the key highlights from the passage on the development of the Apple stores under Steve Jobs and Ron Johnson. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 Here’s a summary:

- Once a year, Jobs held a retreat for Apple’s top employees called “The Top 100.” At the end of each retreat, Jobs would lead a discussion about what new initiatives the company should pursue. 

- In 2001, as the dot-com bubble burst and many were predicting the declining importance of personal computers, Jobs came up with a new strategy: the Macintosh would become the “digital hub” that coordinates various digital devices. Apple would now make the software and devices that allow people to manage their digital lives. 

- This strategy centered around FireWire, a technology that allowed for fast transfer of digital files between devices. Jobs saw that it could enable getting video from cameras onto computers, where the video could be edited. When Adobe refused to make video editing software for Macs, Apple created its own software like iMovie and Final Cut Pro.

- Jobs realized that the Mac as the digital hub allowed the connected devices to be simpler, since the Mac could handle more complex functions like editing video and photos. He also saw that this worked best when the devices and software were tightly integrated, which only Apple was positioned to provide.

- Apple’s first integrated product for the digital hub was video. They made it easy to get video onto Macs, edit it, and then burn it onto DVDs to watch on TVs. 

- Although Jobs initially missed the opportunity for CD burning, Apple soon caught up and developed iTunes software and the iTunes Store to allow people to easily organize and purchase digital music to burn onto iPods. Jobs aimed to make the process simple, just as the company had done with iDVD for video.

- In summary, although Apple was late to some opportunities, Jobs’s vision of the Mac as the digital hub pointed the way toward a unified system of software and devices that transformed the music, movie, and photography industries. His focus on simplicity and an end-to-end solution gave Apple a unique advantage.

 

- Bill Kincaid, a former Apple engineer, created software called SoundJam that allowed Mac users to manage songs on the Rio MP3 player. 
- In 2000, Apple bought SoundJam and brought Kincaid's team onboard. Under Steve Jobs’ direction, they transformed it into iTunes.
- Jobs wanted to create an Apple music player to work seamlessly with iTunes. He said existing players "truly sucked."
- Jon Rubinstein, Apple's hardware engineer, couldn't find a supplier for a small enough hard drive. Then, on a trip to Japan, Toshiba showed him a 
1.8-inch drive that could hold 1,000 songs. Rubinstein got Jobs' approval for $10 million to develop the iPod.
- Rubinstein recruited Tony Fadell, an entrepreneurial engineer who had unsuccessfully pitched MP3 players to other companies. Fadell assumed 
he'd be working on a PDA, but Apple wanted him to create an MP3 player to sync with iTunes. 
- Rubinstein and Fadell clashed over who deserved credit for inventing the iPod, earning Fadell the nickname "Tony Baloney." But they worked together 
to overhaul PortalPlayer's MP3 player to create the iPod.
- In April 2001, Jobs held a pivotal meeting to decide on the iPod's key attributes. Fadell presented proposals to Jobs, Rubinstein, Jony Ive, and others.  
Jobs was impatient and said "Don't worry about Sony. We know what we're doing, and they don't." The key decisions were made in that meeting.

So in summary, the key steps were: 1) Buy SoundJam and turn it into iTunes; 2) Find a small hard drive and get approval for development; 
3) Recruit Tony Fadell to lead the project; 4) Decide on the fundamentals at the pivotal April 2001 meeting. After many long nights and clashes 
between Fadell and Rubinstein, the iPod was born.

 

- Steve Jobs preferred informal discussions over formal presentations. He wanted to see and handle physical objects, not slides. 

- Tony Fadell showed Jobs three iPod models, hiding their preferred option under a bowl. Jobs quickly settled on the hard drive model. The process was quick compared to Fadell's experience at Philips.

- Phil Schiller suggested a trackwheel to easily scroll through songs. Jobs loved the idea and put the team to work on it.

- Jobs immersed himself in the iPod's development daily and demanded simplicity. He insisted most functions be performed through iTunes on the computer, not the iPod itself. 

- The iPod would have no on/off switch. It would simply go to sleep and wake up when used.

- The iPod came together with a hard drive that held 1,000 songs, an easy interface, fast syncing, and a long-lasting battery. The team realized it would be hugely appealing.

- Jony Ive wanted a pure white iPod that felt significant, not disposable. The white headphones were also part of this vision of purity and flow.

- The ad team wanted to focus on the iPod's iconic nature. They proposed a silhouette dancing with the white earbuds. Jobs eventually agreed to that vision.

- Jobs realized the iPod's success would drive iMac sales and allow Apple to spend less on iMac ads and more on iPod ads, helping the whole brand.

 

- In 2002, Apple faced a challenge in getting people to buy music for their iPods. People had to buy CDs or download songs from file-sharing services. 
- The music industry also faced a challenge from piracy services like Napster that enabled free song downloading. CD sales were declining.
- Music executives tried to agree on a standard for copy-protecting digital music. They approached Jobs, but Sony pulled out and the talks stalled. 
- Instead, Sony and others created subscription services called Pressplay and MusicNet. They had clunky interfaces and restrictive rules. They flopped.
- Rather than enabling piracy, Jobs wanted to create a legal way to download songs that was simple and appealing. He believed most people wanted to pay if there were good options.
- Jobs proposed creating an "iTunes Store" that sold songs for 99 cents each. Music companies would get 70 cents. Jobs argued a pay-per-song model would work better than subscriptions. 
- Jobs insisted each song be sold individually, rather than whole albums. This was controversial, but Jobs argued consumers just wanted certain songs, not fillers. 
- It took Jobs a year of negotiating to get the top record labels to agree to sell their songs on the iTunes Store. They feared it would upend their business model, but they took the risk.

The summary covers the key details around Jobs's proposal to launch the iTunes Store, including his vision for simplicity, his belief that people wanted to pay for music, his disagreements with record labels, and the year it took to get them to agree to sell on the store. The assistant identifies the major stakes and tensions around digital music at the time.

 

- Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails said that songs in an album support each other, which is how he likes to make music. However, Steve Jobs said that piracy and music downloads had already made the concept of albums moot. The only way to compete was to sell songs individually.

- There was a divide between people who loved technology and those who loved artistry. Jobs loved both and was able to bridge this gap. He said that tech companies don't understand creativity but creative people are disciplined. Music companies don't understand technology and end up with poor technologists. Jobs understood both technology and artistry.

- Jobs worked with Barry Schuler, the CEO of AOL Time Warner, to convince music labels to join the iTunes Store. Schuler said piracy was a big problem and Jobs should argue that the iTunes Store could best protect music.

- Jobs showed the iTunes Store to Roger Ames, the head of Warner Music, who was impressed and agreed to join. Jobs and Ames hammered out details like how many times a track could be used. They then worked to convince other labels.

- The key person to convince was Doug Morris, the head of Universal Music Group. Morris felt piracy was out of control and music companies lacked technology skills. He was smitten with Jobs's complete vision of the iTunes Store, software and the iPod. Morris brought in Jimmy Iovine, who was also impressed. They agreed to quit working with Sony and join Apple.

- Sony was a counter-example to Apple. Though they had great consumer electronics and music artists, divisions didn't work together. Andy Lack negotiated with Jobs to have Sony sell music on the iTunes Store. Lack realized it was both insane and necessary. Though Jobs claimed to want a partnership, he never actually gave them a cut of iPod sales, as Lack wanted. Jobs seduced Morris and Ames but Lack stayed isolated.

- Jobs tried to seduce Lack but Lack knew not to fall for it. Though Sony agreed to join the iTunes Store, the relationship remained contentious because Jobs and Lack often clashed. Jobs thought Lack had a big ego and didn't understand the music business. Lack thought Jobs was solicitous but a “dick.”

 Here’s a summary:

- Steve Jobs wanted to launch the iTunes Music Store to provide a legal alternative to music piracy services. He spent a lot of time convincing major record labels and musicians to allow their music to be sold through the iTunes Store.

- The iTunes Store launched in April 2003 with over 200,000 songs at 99 cents each. It was wildly successful and sold over 1 million songs in the first 6 days. This shocked the music industry and demonstrated how much people were willing to pay for legal and convenient access to digital music.

- When Microsoft executives saw the iTunes Store, they realized how far behind they were. They knew they needed to build their own music service to compete, but struggled to replicate Apple’s success in working with record labels and creating a user-friendly service. 

- Initially, the iPod was only compatible with Mac computers. But Apple's executives eventually convinced Jobs it made business sense to make the iPod compatible with Windows PCs as well. However, they then had to decide whether to also create iTunes software for Windows. Jobs argued they should do it right, so Apple developed their own iTunes for Windows.

- Allowing the iPod to work with Windows PCs and creating iTunes for Windows helped Apple reach many more customers and boosted iPod sales. But Jobs still preferred to create a fully integrated experience between Apple's hardware and software.

So in summary, through perseverance and vision, Steve Jobs built the music industry's first successful online music store and convinced his own company to take the steps to make the iPod and iTunes compatible with Windows, even though it wasn't his initial preference. And this combination of the iPod, iTunes, and the iTunes Store went on to revolutionize the music industry.

 

- Steve Jobs decided to port iTunes to Windows, allowing it to reach a much wider audience. This was controversial, as Apple had originally promised music companies that iTunes would only be for Macs. But most music companies eventually agreed. 

- The launch of iTunes for Windows was a successful event. Bono even appeared on video to praise it. Jobs declared it "the best Windows app ever written."

- Microsoft was not happy about iTunes for Windows. Bill Gates saw it as Jobs controlling both hardware and software, the same strategy as with the Mac. Microsoft's Zune music player failed against the iPod. Jobs attributed this to Microsoft lacking passion for music.

- Sony was in a good position to compete with Apple in digital music, since it had a music company and a history of innovative devices. But it was divided into divisions that didn't work well together. Sony worried that an easy music sharing system would hurt music sales. Sony's attempts at a music service and Walkman competitor failed.

- Other competitors tried different strategies against Apple. RealNetworks tried to create a service that would work with iPods and other devices, but Jobs stopped it. Rob Glaser of RealNetworks said "Steve is a one-of-a-kind guy."

- Apple kept improving the iPod, releasing the popular iPod Mini and iPod Shuffle. The iPod came to dominate the market.

- The iTunes Store was also a huge success. It sold 1 million songs in 6 days, 70 million in its first year, and 1 billion by 2006. The success of iTunes built up Apple as a trusted service for payments, identity, and more.

So in summary, a consistent theme was Jobs's insistence on fully integrated products that provided an end-to-end experience controlled by Apple. Competitors tried different strategies but failed against Apple's passion for music, constant innovation, and seamlessly integrated products. The iPod and iTunes led to Apple's dominance in music and built its reputation in e-commerce.

 

- Steve Jobs's iPod contained a mix of music reflecting his youth in the 70s with a heart in the 60s - Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Rolling Stones, etc. Only about 1/4 of the songs were from contemporary artists.

- His favorites were Dylan, The Beatles, and Bach. He liked comparing Glenn Gould's recordings of Bach's Goldberg Variations from 1955 and 1981, appreciating how much Gould had matured.  

- Jobs thought Donovan and The Grateful Dead's music didn't hold up as well today but still liked some songs that reminded him of his youth. He enjoyed Joni Mitchell's "Both Sides Now" and its lyrics reflecting on aging and life's illusions.

- Jobs worried John Mayer was wasting his talent and musical gifts. He thought Mayer was a good person underneath but seemed out of control.

- Given the choice, Jobs said he'd save The Beatles' master recordings over any other artist's, even Dylan's. But he felt fortunate to have grown up during a time with Dylan, The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones.

- Jobs was tongue-tied when he met Bob Dylan before a 2004 concert, one of his heroes. But in talking with Dylan for two hours, he found Dylan as sharp as ever, which delighted him. Dylan was not Jobs's friend but invited him to visit before the show.

 

- Steve Jobs was a huge fan of Bob Dylan and wanted to bring his music to iTunes.
- The record label Sony resisted making a deal. They didn't want Dylan's music sold cheaply and thought it would devalue him.
- Eventually, Sony's CEO left and Jobs reopened negotiations. They struck a deal to sell Dylan's full catalog for $199 as well as his new album. 
- Dylan even appeared in an iPod commercial, helping to propel his album to #1. The ad helped Dylan reach a new, younger audience.
- Jobs was also obsessed with getting The Beatles on iTunes. He spent over 30 years negotiating with them and their label.
- The Beatles wanted to be on iTunes but had to work out their own differences first with EMI, their label, who they didn't get along with. 
- Jobs hoped he would live to resolve the issues to get them on iTunes. He eventually did.
- Bono and U2 appreciated the marketing power of Apple. Bono was confident U2 was still the best band in the world, but Apple's marketing helped propel them to new levels of success.

So in summary, Steve Jobs was a lover of music and sought to bring some of his favorite artists to Apple's iTunes platform, helping to market and propel them to even greater success and popularity. Though negotiations were difficult, he eventually succeeded in striking deals with artists like Bob Dylan, The Beatles, and U2.

 

- U2 is an iconic Irish rock band that has been together since the 1970s. In 2004, they were trying to revamp their image and produced an exciting new album with a catchy new song called "Vertigo."

- Bono, the lead singer, wanted to promote the song aggressively to gain traction, so he pitched Steve Jobs on using the song in an iPod commercial, even though U2 had never done commercials before. 

- Jobs was hesitant to feature recognizable people or non-white colors in the iconic iPod ads, but Bono pushed back and argued that they could use the band's silhouette. Jobs came around but continued negotiating details like the financial terms and physical design of a potential U2 special edition iPod.

- There were a few times when the deal almost fell through due to doubts on both sides, but key interventions from people like James Vincent, Steve Jobs' marketing executive, and Jony Ive, Apple's head designer and a U2 fan, helped salvage the partnership. 

- Ultimately, U2 agreed to appear in the commercial and have a special black iPod with a red click wheel made in exchange for royalty payments and promotion of their new album. The commercial and album release were unveiled at an Apple event.

- The partnership ended up benefitting both parties greatly. U2 reached a younger audience and saw a sales boost, while Apple tapped into U2's popularity and countercultural coolness in order to make the iPod brand more appealing. The success of this deal led to future productive partnerships and a personal friendship between Steve Jobs and Bono, though their negotiations were not always easy.   

- Despite not typically being philanthropic, Jobs also agreed to do a (PRODUCT)RED partnership with Bono to raise money for AIDS in Africa, though Jobs insisted on not putting "Apple" in parentheses. The story shows how Jobs could be a exacting partner but grew to respect and befriend Bono.

 

- Yo-Yo Ma is a renowned cellist and a versatile virtuoso. Steve Jobs was deeply moved by his artistry and purity. Jobs invited Ma to play at his wedding but Ma was unavailable. Ma later visited Jobs' home and played Bach for them on his Stradivarius cello. Jobs said "You playing is the best argument I've ever heard for the existence of God." Ma promised to play at Jobs' funeral.  

- Pixar was an escape for Jobs where the culture was more gentle and serene. Jobs let the creative talents at Pixar flourish without micromanaging them, unlike at Apple. 

- Jobs' main role at Pixar was dealmaking. He clashed with Jeffrey Katzenberg over the movies A Bug's Life and Antz, which were both about animated ants. Katzenberg had rushed Antz into production to force Disney to change A Bug's Life's release date. Jobs and others at Pixar felt betrayed by Katzenberg. The rivalry and media frenzy ended up helping to promote both movies. A Bug's Life was more successful at the box office.  

- Katzenberg and Jobs later reconciled, though Jobs said he never fully forgave Katzenberg for what he did. Katzenberg respected Jobs as a genius despite their volatile history.

- The success of A Bug's Life showed that Toy Story was not a fluke and gave Pixar credibility. Toy Story 2 was an even bigger hit, allowing Pixar to build a new headquarters.

That covers the key highlights on Yo-Yo Ma, Pixar, the movie rivalries, and Steve Jobs' role in all of these events. Please let me know if you would like me to explain anything in the summary in more detail.

 

- Pixar's headquarters in Emeryville were outdated, so Steve Jobs commissioned architect Peter Bohlin to design a new building. 

- Jobs was intensely involved in every detail of the new building's design. He wanted to promote unplanned encounters and collaboration. The building has one huge atrium, two big bathrooms, and other features to facilitate mingling.

- There was tension building between Jobs and Michael Eisner, Disney's CEO. Eisner had made a comment criticizing Apple's "Rip, mix, burn" ads that angered Jobs. Also, Eisner had not shown much interest in learning from Pixar's success. 

- Jobs told Roy Disney he would not renew the Pixar-Disney deal if Eisner was still CEO. Eisner sent an intemperate email to Disney's board claiming that Finding Nemo, Pixar's upcoming film, was "okay but nowhere near as good as their previous films."

- However, when Finding Nemo was released, it became Pixar's biggest hit yet, grossing over $800 million worldwide. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film. Its success gave Pixar a lot of leverage in negotiations with Disney.

- Jobs made Disney a very one-sided offer for a new distribution deal in which Pixar would own the films and characters completely and just pay Disney a 7.5% distribution fee. The goal was clearly just to force Disney to negotiate seriously.

 

- Steve Jobs and Pixar had a distribution deal with Disney that was expiring. Disney CEO Michael Eisner wanted to get Pixar to renew the deal on his terms. 
- Eisner felt he had leverage because Disney owned the rights to Pixar's movies and characters. He threatened to have Disney's animation studio make Toy Story 3 without Pixar. 
- Jobs and Pixar were unhappy with Eisner's leadership and management style. Jobs publicly criticized Disney's recent movies as "embarrassing duds." Jobs wanted to end negotiations.
- Disney CEO-in-waiting Bob Iger did damage control with Jobs to try and save the Pixar relationship. Iger was more sensible and easier to work with than Eisner. 
- Iger was named Disney CEO in 2005, replacing Eisner. He immediately called Jobs and said he valued Pixar. Jobs was thrilled, as he liked Iger. 
- Iger and Jobs negotiated a deal for ABC TV shows to be on the new video iPod. This helped build their relationship and trust.
- At the iPod announcement, Iger came on stage as a surprise guest. Though just announcing the ABC deal, it signaled that a new Disney-Pixar deal was now possible under Iger's leadership. 
- Iger realized that the only recent memorable characters in Disney's parades were from Pixar. He saw this as an "indictment" of Disney animation under Eisner. Iger was determined to fix the broken Pixar relationship.

In summary, a shift to Bob Iger as the new Disney CEO made a renewal of the Pixar distribution deal possible. Iger's more constructive relationship with Steve Jobs and appreciation of Pixar helped turn around the companies' souring partnership under Eisner's leadership.

 Here’s a summary:

After Steve Jobs returned to Apple and launched the iMac, he and Jony Ive made innovative and attractive design a hallmark of Apple’s products. Some of the models were more successful than others, but they helped differentiate Apple’s computers and drew publicity. 

One example was the Power Mac G4 Cube, released in 2000. It was an eight-inch cube, the size of a tissue box, with a slot for CDs but no buttons or fan. Its minimalist sophistication exemplified Jobs’ design aesthetic. As Jobs said, its thoughtful exterior suggested a thoroughly considered interior design. These attention-grabbing designs helped Apple survive in an era dominated by Windows PCs.

Though some models now seem too exuberant, at the time they highlighted Apple’s love of design and made the company stand out. The computers were like the bell-bottoms of their time, fashionable for a while though later a bit embarrassing. But overall they served their purpose well in helping revitalize Apple’s brand and product line.

 

- Steve Jobs designed the G4 Cube, an aesthetically appealing but expensive desktop computer. It was a commercial failure due to being overpriced. Jobs learned from this experience and became more budget-conscious in later products like the iPod. 

- In 2000, disappointing sales of the G4 Cube and problems in Apple's education market caused a 50% drop in Apple's stock price. However, Jobs remained focused on innovative design. He and Jony Ive designed the flat-screen iMac to resemble a sunflower. 

- In 2005, Jobs made the decision to transition the Mac from the PowerPC chip to Intel chips. This was a complex task that took 18 months of planning with the board and negotiations with Intel CEO Paul Otellini. The transition was successfully completed ahead of schedule, impressing even Bill Gates.

- Despite portraying himself as indifferent to money, Jobs pushed for and received enormous stock option grants from Apple's board of directors. However, a plunge in Apple's stock price in 2000 rendered his options worthless for a time. A 2001 Fortune magazine cover story portrayed Jobs as an example of CEO greed due to the stock options, though they were actually worthless. Jobs demanded and got another massive options grant from the adoring board in 2001.  

- Overall, the summary depicts Jobs as a complex figure with regards to money and design. He was budget-conscious and learned from expensive failures like the Cube, but also pursued advanced and striking designs. He cultivated an image of being unconcerned with money but demanded lavish compensation and perks from Apple. The board largely acceded to his wishes due to his leadership and vision.

 

• In October 2003, Jobs went in for a routine abdominal scan that revealed a tumor on his pancreas.

• The doctors initially feared the worst and warned Jobs to get his affairs in order. But further tests revealed it was a rare, treatable form of pancreatic cancer called an islet cell neuroendocrine tumor. 

• Jobs refused the recommended course of surgery and instead tried alternative therapies like extreme diets, juice fasts, acupuncture, and herbal remedies. His friends and family urged him to have the surgery, but he resisted.

• Art Levinson, the CEO of Genentech, and Andy Grove, the CEO of Intel, both cancer survivors, tried unsuccessfully to persuade Jobs to have the operation. His wife Laurene also tried but said "he really was not ready to open his body."

• Jobs regretted his initial refusal of surgery. His alternative methods seemed motivated by his desire to maintain personal control and avoid invasive procedures. But in the end, the cancer could not be cured without surgery and chemotherapy.

• The standoff between Jobs and his doctors was "enormously frustrating" and nearly ruined some friendships. But after nine months of alternative methods, Jobs finally agreed to surgery in July 2004.

• The story illustrates Jobs's penchant for trying to exert extreme control over his environment and believing he could bend reality to his will through sheer force of mind. But cancer cannot be cured that way. After resisting for so long, Jobs finally had to yield to the normal medical approach.

 

- Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in October 2003 but resisted surgery for 9 months due to his stubbornness and desire to insist that things go the way he wanted.

- In July 2004, tests showed the tumor had grown, forcing Jobs to face reality. He had surgery to remove part of his pancreas. Unfortunately, the cancer had spread to 3 spots on his liver.

- Jobs kept his continuing health issues a secret and told people he had been cured. Surprisingly, he agreed to give the 2005 Stanford commencement speech where he was very personal about his cancer diagnosis. He told 3 stories from his life to illustrate major lessons. The speech was simple, intimate and very moving. 

- For Jobs' 50th birthday in 2005, his wife threw a small surprise party with close friends and colleagues including Tim Cook, Jony Ive and Alice Waters. Cook had done well running Apple during Jobs' absence but was happy to recede into the background when Jobs returned. Though Cook wasn't a "product person," Jobs made him Chief Operating Officer.

- Two of Jobs' top lieutenants, Jon Rubinstein and Avie Tevanian, decided to leave Apple around this time. Rubinstein was upset about Cook's rise and frazzled after working for Jobs for 9 years. Tevanian had made a lot of money and was ready to retire. Jobs considered Tevanian's departure a huge loss.

 

- Jon Rubinstein, the head of Apple’s hardware engineering, frequently clashed with Jony Ive, the head of design, over engineering feasibility of new product designs. Ive would push the envelope and propose bold designs that were difficult to actually build, while Rubinstein focused on practicality and meeting schedules. 

- Jobs usually sided with Ive in these disputes. There were several clashes over design details that Rubinstein thought were impractical or too expensive. Ive would often go around Rubinstein to work with engineers directly and get them to implement his designs.

- The tensions led to shouting matches and almost physical confrontations at times. Eventually, Ive told Jobs “It’s him or me.” Jobs chose Ive, and Rubinstein decided to leave, taking time off to build a house in Mexico. Jobs was furious when Rubinstein joined Palm, a competitor, though he later admitted he overreacted.

- With Rubinstein gone, Jobs built a new management team, including Tim Cook, Jony Ive, Scott Forstall, Phil Schiller, Eddy Cue, and Peter Oppenheimer. Though demographically similar, they had a range of styles. Cook was coolly logical, while Ive was emotional. But they all knew to argue their positions with Jobs, who encouraged dissent to improve decision making. 

- Jobs instituted “Apple University” to teach the company’s style of decision making and focus. Jobs was focused on pruning the company to focus on just two or three priorities at a time. 

- Jobs’s health scare and brush with death did not make him more humble. Rather, he returned to Apple with even more passion and boldness. Though for a while he was less harsh in his criticism of others, his rough edges eventually returned. His way of achieving “catharsis” was sometimes to hurt people, using his sensitivity to efficiently and effectively cause pain. 

- Over time, Jobs’s attitude toward Bill Gates mellowed. Microsoft kept developing great software for Mac, and became less relevant as a competitor. Jobs and Gates had different approaches but developed a grudging mutual self-awareness and respect. At an All Things Digital conference, despite an earlier swipe from Jobs, they had a cordial joint appearance, where they discussed their old rivalry and new partnership.

 

- Steve Jobs was worried that cell phones could threaten iPod's dominance, so he explored a partnership with Motorola to make a phone with an iPod built in. The resulting ROKR phone was a flop.

- Jobs realized that most cell phones "stank" and were too complicated, so he decided Apple should make its own phone. The team started by trying to modify the iPod to work as a phone, but the trackwheel was not suitable for dialing numbers or inputting information.

- At the same time, Apple had a secret tablet project underway. The ideas developed for the tablet ended up influencing the iPhone.

- At a dinner party, a Microsoft employee kept boasting about  Microsoft's upcoming tablet with stylus input. Jobs found the idea terrible and was motivated to show how a tablet should really be done. He told his team to develop a multi-touch display that would allow typing by touching the screen with fingers instead of using a stylus.

- Jony Ive's design team had already been experimenting with multi-touch for trackpads and worked on a prototype in their spare time. Ive knew Jobs could be very judgmental, so he showed it to him privately. Jobs loved it and realized it could be used for an interface for the new cell phone as well.

- Jobs called a secret meeting to discuss using the multi-touch interface for the upcoming phone. The multi-touch technology ended up being a key feature that made the iPhone revolutionary.

So in summary, the failures of the ROKR phone, a desire to leapfrog existing phones that "stank," and inspiration from a multi-touch tablet prototype all led to convergence on developing the iPhone with its groundbreaking multi-touch interface. The multi-touch technology allowed the creation of a phone, tablet, and iPod in one device.

 

- Steve Jobs and his team wanted to develop a new phone. They considered two options: one with an iPod trackwheel and one with a multi-touch screen. 
- They acquired a company called FingerWorks that made multi-touch trackpads and had developed technology to detect various finger gestures. 
- After 6 months of work on both options, Jobs decided they should proceed with the multi-touch screen phone, which was riskier but more innovative.
- The team decided not to include a hardware keyboard, instead opting for an on-screen software keyboard that could change based on the task. This made the interface very flexible.
- Jobs was very involved in refining the multi-touch interface over 6 months. Many features like "swipe to open" and sensors to detect when the phone was by your ear came out of creative brainstorming sessions. 
- Originally the iPhone was going to have a plastic screen, but Jobs wanted glass that was durable and scratch-resistant. They found a company called Corning that had developed Gorilla Glass in the 1960s but never marketed it. Corning produced as much Gorilla Glass as possible in under 6 months to meet Apple's demands.
- At the last minute, Jobs decided the original aluminum case design he had approved was not right and they needed to start over, putting most of the focus on the glass display. The new design was austere yet inviting. They had to redo much of the internal components to make the new design work, but Jobs insisted. 
- The final design was tightly sealed, with the case not even allowing the battery to be changed. Jobs wanted tight control over the user experience.

In summary, the development of the original iPhone featured a risky bet on multi-touch technology, creative brainstorming around the interface, Jobs's perfectionism and micromanagement of the design, and a last minute big change that required starting from scratch but produced an iconic design. The process was difficult but resulted in a transformative product.

 

- By early 2008, it was clear that Steve Jobs's cancer was spreading. He was experiencing increased pain and eating problems that caused him to lose 40 pounds that spring. 

- His eating disorders and restrictive diets had been problematic since his teenage years. Although his family tried to get him to eat a balanced diet, he would often go on fasts or eat only one type of food for weeks. His eating problems got worse in 2008 and caused a lot of stress for his family.

- In March 2008, Fortune published an article about Jobs's health problems and the backdating of Apple stock options. Jobs tried unsuccessfully to convince Fortune not to publish the story. When he appeared at the iPhone 3G launch in June 2008, he was very thin, which overshadowed the product announcement. 

- In July 2008, Joe Nocera of the NY Times wrote a column criticizing Apple's lack of transparency regarding Jobs's health. Jobs called Nocera and accused him of being a "slime bucket," but did give him some off-the-record information about his health struggles. However, it was not the full truth about how serious the situation was.

- There were increasing concerns about Jobs's weight loss and health that caused Apple's stock price to drop. The company continued to insist that it was a private matter.

In summary, 2008 was a difficult year for Steve Jobs in terms of his deteriorating health and his struggles to maintain his privacy around his illness. His eating disorder and cancer symptoms caused significant weight loss and other problems that he tried to hide from the public as much as possible.

 

- Steve Jobs's health declined significantly in 2008. His weight loss and gaunt appearance worried shareholders and Apple employees. 

- In August 2008, Bloomberg News accidentally published Jobs's prewritten obituary, causing Apple's stock price to drop. Jobs reacted with humor, saying "Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated."

- Jobs's friend Doug Morris visited him in October 2008 and was surprised to see how ill Jobs looked. Jobs attended Morris's charity event for cancer research but felt very ill the whole time. 

- Jobs canceled appearances in December 2008 and January 2009. He wrote a misleading letter in January 2009 attributing his weight loss to a "hormone imbalance" with a "simple remedy." In reality, his cancer had spread to his liver.

- Due to legal requirements as CEO of a public company, Jobs took a medical leave of absence in January 2009. His friend Bill Campbell considered resigning from Apple's board to protect Jobs's privacy but stayed on after determining he could do so legally.

- Board member Jerry York was angry about the company's lack of transparency regarding Jobs's health. His criticisms were reported anonymously in the press but confirmed after his death. Other board members defended the company's actions as legally sufficient.

- Jobs's doctors repeatedly suggested a liver transplant, which he finally agreed to in January 2009. However, he was unable to receive a transplant in California in time due to a shortage of donors with his blood type and lower priority as a cancer patient.

- Jobs's wife Laurene monitored organ donor websites and determined Jobs would not receive a liver in California before June 2009, even though doctors said he would need a transplant by April.

 

• Steve Jobs was able to get on liver transplant waiting lists in both California and Tennessee by using his private plane to fly to hospitals for evaluations. This practice of "multiple listing" favors wealthy people but is allowed.  

• Jobs's friend George Riley knew the head of transplant at Methodist University Hospital in Memphis, James Eason. Eason was willing to add Jobs to the Tennessee list and evaluate him in Palo Alto.

• In March 2009, Jobs's health was declining rapidly. He moved up the waiting lists in Tennessee and was at the top, but no liver became available for over three weeks. Finally, a liver from a young car crash victim became available, and Jobs flew to Memphis for the successful transplant surgery.

• However, the cancer had spread during the wait. The doctors found spots on internal membranes and tumors in the new liver. They had to perform another surgery and Jobs developed pneumonia, coming close to death. His family flew in to say goodbye. 

• Laurene Powell managed all aspects of Jobs's complicated recovery and care. Eason also took control in a way the Stanford doctors had not, coordinating everything. Two nurses from Mississippi became Jobs's favorites because they were not intimidated by him.

• Jobs was impatient and irritable as an invalid, sometimes hallucinating or becoming angry. But he remained finicky about even minor details of his environment and care. Powell and Eason had to work hard to manage him.

• Jobs's daughter Lisa twice flew to Memphis to visit, which Jobs appreciated. But in general, as he recovered, Jobs's difficult personality reasserted itself. He remained a picky eater, insisting on tasting many fruit smoothies before approving one. Eason finally convinced him he needed to eat for medicine, not taste.

• Jobs enjoyed visits from Tim Cook and others at Apple, where details of new products under development buoyed his spirits. Riley arranged a private tour of Sun Studio in Memphis, where Jobs wanted to hire their young tour guide for iTunes.

• At the end of May, Jobs flew back to California on his private jet, accompanied by his wife and sister. Cook and Ive met them on landing, marking Jobs's return home.

 

• Steve Jobs was initially skeptical of the tablet concept but came around to it as the idea evolved at Apple. The project got more serious around 2007 as an alternative to designing a netbook. 

• Jobs and Ive worked closely on the design, focusing on simplicity and paring away excess elements. They determined the key attribute was the display screen. Everything else had to defer to that. Jobs pushed hard for a simplified, minimalist design.

• They settled on the screen size after testing many prototypes. Jobs wanted a tablet that felt casual and natural to pick up with one hand. Ive figured out that slightly rounding the edge of the tablet would signal that it could be casually grasped. 

• Apple applied for a patent on a tablet design that closely matched what became the iPad. Jobs and Ive were listed as inventors.

• Initially, Jobs wanted to use an Intel Atom chip. But Tony Fadell and others argued for using a chip based on the simpler, lower-power ARM architecture. They eventually persuaded Jobs to drop Intel.

• Apple ended up licensing the ARM architecture but also buying a chip design firm, P.A. Semi, to create a custom ARM-based system-on-a-chip for the iPad called the A4.

• In summary, the iPad project crystallized around building a simplified tablet experience centered on a multi-touch screen. Jobs was pushed to abandon his preference to use an Intel chip in favor of a custom ARM-based chip that could meet the goals of a simple, low-power design.

 

- Steve Jobs unveiled the iPad on January 27, 2010. The announcement garnered significant media attention and speculation. Some critics were impressed with its potential as an immersive device for consuming content, while others lamented its lack of capabilities for content creation. 
- The iPad launched officially in April 2010. Reviews were mixed, with some praising its beautiful design and potential to reshape personal computing. Others, however, saw it as a larger iPod Touch that lacked capabilities like USB ports, Flash support, and cameras.
- Steve Jobs was initially disappointed with some of the critical and tepid reactions. However, reviews became much more positive once people got their hands on the actual product. Media organizations like Time and Newsweek that had been critical put the iPad on their covers.
- Debate centered around whether the iPad's closed, integrated system was brilliant or misguided. Some argued that it enabled an unparalleled user experience, while others felt it was too restrictive and limiting. This debate mirrored earlier discussions around the Macintosh platform.
- The launch of the iPad marked a revival of sorts in Steve Jobs's relationship with Steve Wozniak and Daniel Kottke. Both attended the launch at Apple stores, reflecting on how far the company had come. Even Wozniak, a proponent of open systems, praised the advantages of Apple's closed ecosystem in creating intuitive products for mainstream users. 
- The iPad quickly became a cultural and commercial phenomenon, cementing its place in Apple's product lineup and shaping an entire new market. It epitomized Steve Jobs's ability to develop products that people didn't even know they needed yet couldn't live without once they were released.

 

- The iPad initially came with some basic apps like the Bloomberg app, Scrabble, and The Federalist Papers. Jobs' team also had various media they enjoyed on their iPads like newspapers, TV shows, baseball, and NPR. 

- An article about a poor 6-year-old boy intuitively using an iPad stirred Jobs. He saw that the iPad was so simple that even an illiterate child could use it, which he found magical. 

- The iPad sold 1 million units in under a month, twice as fast as the iPhone. It eventually became one of the most successful consumer product launches ever.

- However, Jobs was unhappy with the initial iPad ads. He found them boring and like Pottery Barn commercials. His ad team spent two weeks coming up with new options, and they eventually settled on the "Manifesto" campaign which focused on the iPad's revolutionary nature.

- The iPad's success came from its apps in addition to its sleek hardware. There were thousands of apps that let people do many entertaining activities. The apps platform was open to outside developers but in a carefully controlled way.

- Originally, Jobs resisted allowing third-party iPhone apps. But board members and execs convinced him to allow them, arguing that customers would love them and competitors would allow them if Apple didn't. Jobs found a solution to allow apps but retain control and simplicity. 

- The App Store opened in 2008, reached 1 billion downloads in 9 months, and led to a new industry with 500K apps and 15 billion downloads by 2011. The apps and the App Store were key to the iPad's success.

 

- With the launch of the iPad and its App Store, Steve Jobs began transforming the publishing and journalism industries. 

- Jobs offered book publishers the agency model, where they could set their own ebook prices in the iBooks Store and Apple would take 30% of the revenue. This contrasted with Amazon's $9.99 ebook model. Jobs convinced publishers to force Amazon to accept the agency model as well.

- Jobs hoped to help save journalism by offering publishers a way to charge for digital content. However, publishers were wary of giving 30% of their revenue to Apple and losing their direct customer relationship. Jobs was especially interested in working with The New York Times but they were hesitant. After a year, the Times started selling subscriptions through Apple, charging more than the $5/month Jobs suggested.

- Jobs also met with magazine executives at Time Inc. but they too did not want to give up their customer billing relationship and ability to direct readers to their website to purchase subscriptions. Time CEO Jeff Bewkes respected Jobs but his company refused to sell magazine subscriptions through the App Store on Jobs's terms.

- In general, while Jobs wanted to help the publishing and journalism industries transition to digital, his insistence on the agency model and owning the customer caused most companies to be unwilling to sell content through Apple. They feared loss of revenue, data, and the customer relationship.

 

- Steve Jobs felt betrayed by Google's decision to compete with Apple in smartphones. 
- He believed Google's Eric Schmidt and founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin had copied many of the iPhone's innovations in their Android operating system.
- Jobs had warned Google not to copy certain features like multi-touch, or he would sue. But in early 2010 an HTC Android phone was released with many iPhone-like features.
- So Apple sued HTC, and indirectly Google and Android, for patent infringement. Apple alleged violation of 20 patents covering various iPhone innovations.
- The lawsuit illustrated the difference in philosophies between Apple's closed model and Google's open model for smartphones. Apple controlled everything proprietary, while Google shared its Android software with many manufacturers. 
- Jobs felt Google's "Don't be evil" slogan was "bullshit" because they entered the phone business and wanted to "kill the iPhone." But Google believed in being open.
- The rivalry intensified over the coming years into a pitched battle for the future of smartphones.

In summary, Steve Jobs was livid with Google over Android, felt betrayed by executives he had mentored, and believed Android copied from the iPhone. The dispute illustrated the clash between Apple's closed and Google's open models of innovation. The fight would shape the smartphone wars for years.

 

- Steve Jobs was furious when he saw Android, calling it a "stolen product" and vowing to "destroy" it. He felt Google had copied many of the iPhone's features and designs.

- The dispute highlighted a debate over "closed" versus "open" systems. Apple integrated hardware and software, while Google licensed its operating system to many hardware makers. Jobs believed in tight control of the user experience, while Google believed open led to more choice and innovation. 

- Bill Gates sided more with Google's open approach, believing competition led to greater consumer benefits. But Jobs insisted "the coherence thing" of tying software and hardware together produced superior results, even if it meant fewer options.

- Jobs' insistence on control was also seen in Apple's refusal to allow Flash on the iPhone or iPad and its strict curating of apps allowed in the App Store. Jobs disliked Flash and believed cross-platform software led to "lowest-common-denominator" results. The App Store rules were initially too restrictive, leading to controversy and Jobs apology, though he still believed in the need for some guidelines.

- In balancing openness and control, Jobs sought advice on how to hold the line on decency standards without seeming like "Big Brother" censorship. But an advisory group on the issue never formed.

- Jobs declared "we have a moral responsibility" to keep pornography off iOS devices, a stance that also caused controversy regarding censorship and limitation of choice.  

In the end, the summary depicts Jobs as a strong believer in tight integration of Apple's systems and strict control of the user experience, for better and at times for worse, in marked contrast with the more open approach championed by Google and some other Silicon Valley figures. His desire for end-to-end control shaped many of Apple's most controversial decisions during his final years as CEO.

 

• Ryan Tate, editor of Valleywag, emailed Steve Jobs criticizing Apple's control over app approvals and censorship of porn. Jobs responded defending Apple's policies which aim to protect users' privacy and security. 

• Jobs and Tate went back and forth, with Tate arguing for more openness and freedom of choice, and Jobs arguing that Apple's control and censorship were to benefit and protect users. Jobs ended up personally insulting Tate.

• Many praised Jobs for openly defending Apple's positions, but others saw Apple as increasingly arrogant, controlling, and the “Man” that they had rebelled against in their famous 1984 ad. Apple's board and leaders like Al Gore worried about Apple's arrogance. Jobs denied it.

• The launch of the iPhone 4 in 2010 demonstrated the tension between design and engineering in Apple. Jony Ive's beautiful but problematic design ended up causing the “Antennagate” issue where holding the phone a certain way caused dropped calls for some. 

• Jobs was initially defensive but then personally hurt by the criticism. Apple conducted studies showing the issue was minor but real. Jobs flew back and gathered old advisors to help address it. They prepared for a press conference to explain the issue and offer a fix.

• In summary, Apple under Jobs pursued bold designs and policies with confidence but sometimes crossed the line into arrogance in the eyes of critics. The Antennagate issue was a high-profile example of where a focus on design led to an engineering issue that caused a public relations crisis. Jobs navigated it by acknowledging the problem, explaining it, and offering a fix.

 Here’s a summary:

• Jobs began planning for the iPad 2 immediately after the initial iPad launched. He wanted it to be thinner, have front and rear cameras, and have a smart cover.

• Jobs focused on designing a detachable cover that could connect to the iPad magnetically. He wanted a cover that showed off the iPad’s design rather than hiding it. After reading an article on magnets, Jobs gave it to Jony Ive’s design team, who created a magnetic hinge to allow the cover to snap onto the iPad.

• The smart cover and iPad 2 were designed together to ensure the magnets and hinge lined up perfectly. Jobs saw this as another example of integrating the software and hardware.

• Although Jobs was on medical leave, he insisted on attending the iPad 2 launch in March 2011. At the launch, he expressed that he didn’t want to miss the day, showing how important the product was to him. The event featured the usual Apple executives, Tim Cook, and Beatles music. Jobs’s son Reed even attended with two college friends.

• The iPad 2 included front and rear cameras, was thinner, and included the smart cover, but the smart cover became one of its most memorable features due to its design and mechanics. The smart cover epitomized Jobs’s focus on seamless end-to-end integration and even the smallest details.

That covers the key highlights on Jobs’s work on the iPad 2 and its launch. Let me know if you would like me to explain anything in the summary in more detail.

 Here’s a jaunty summary:

With a devilish grin and panache to spare, Steve Jobs breezily demoed the new iPad 2. “We designed the
case and product together this time,” he cheekily explained. Addressing complaints the iPad 1 was better for
consuming than creating, Apple jazzed up iPad versions of Mac creative apps GarageBand and iMovie. Jobs
nonchalantly showed how to whip up a song or edit your movie masterpiece in a thrice.  

Touting Apple’s “whole widget” approach, Jobs insisted  true creativity comes from integrating software,
hardware, content and yes, even cases, not the fragmented open approach of Windows or Android. “Technology
alone isn’t enough. Technology matched with the humanities—that’s what makes our hearts sing,” he crooned.

Feeling chipper after the launch, Jobs joined family and friends for a lavish lunch where, to everyone’s surprise,
he heartily indulged in fresh juice, pasta and ice cream! “Living with constant pain and mortality reminds you
not to make long-term plans,” he advised. “But you must force yourself to think long-term sometimes.” For
example, his plan to build a luxury yacht, designing new models whenever bored or dissatisfied. Though
worried he might not see it finished, he persevered: “If I quit, I’ll really be pissed if I live another 2 years!” 

Showing off the sleek minimalist models, Jobs admired the 40-foot high, specially-made glass walls. The chief
Apple store engineer designed support for their immense weight. “I may die and leave Laurene with a half-built
boat, but must keep going,” he said.  

Celebrating his 20th anniversary soon, Jobs reflected on his good fortune in Laurene. “Not only is she smart and
beautiful, she’s turned out to be a really good person.” He teared up remembering exes but knew he “ended up
in the right place.” Admitting he was often selfish and demanding, he said “Living with me is not a bowl of
cherries.” Usually forgetting anniversaries, he planned a surprise: Revisiting their wedding hotel. Unable to book
their old suite, Jobs offered to pay another guest to swap. “The man kindly said ‘After 20 years, please take it.
It’s yours.’” 

Jobs found their wedding photos and created huge prints in an elegant box with a heartfelt note. Recounting
their journey together through joy and sorrow, it ended: “My feet have never returned to the ground.” He made
copies for their kids, “So they can see I was once young.”

With a flourish, Jobs had shared his softer side—and his vision for technology married with humanities in the
“post-PC devices” to come. The digital hub concept had transformed Apple from niche computer maker to the
world’s most valuable tech company. Now he foresaw the hub moving to the cloud, access granted by small
personal devices. And that, jauntily delivered, was the iPad 2 story according to Steve Jobs!

 

- Steve Jobs wanted to move Apple’s content and services to the cloud so customers could access them on any device. 
- In 2008, Apple launched MobileMe, a subscription service to sync content across devices, but it was poorly executed and received negative reviews. Jobs berated the team responsible.
- By 2010, competitors like Google and Amazon were focusing on cloud services. Jobs made improving Apple’s cloud offerings a priority. They developed a new strategy around iCloud.
- Despite health issues, Jobs unveiled iCloud at Apple’s 2011 Worldwide Developers Conference. It provided free storage and automatic syncing of content across devices. Jobs saw it as a way to lock customers into the Apple ecosystem. 
- Jobs wanted to build a new showcase headquarters for Apple. He spent years working with architects on concepts and models for a striking, enduring campus. He saw it as his legacy.

In summary, despite some initial struggles, Apple launched iCloud in 2011 to seamlessly sync customers’ content across devices and lock them into the Apple ecosystem. Around the same time, Jobs began working on plans for a new futuristic campus to serve as his legacy at the company.

 

- Steve Jobs’s health was deteriorating in 2009, but he was determined to stay alive to see his son Reed's high school graduation in June 2010. 
- Reed looked a lot like his father at 18 and shared his father's intensity, but he inherited his mother's sweetness and empathy. Reed idolized his father.
- After Jobs got sick, Reed spent his summers working in a Stanford oncology lab studying colon cancer genetics. His senior school project was on the research he did there. Jobs was proud of Reed's enthusiasm for the intersection of biology and technology.
- Reed grew up fast in 2009 when Jobs was very sick. He helped take care of his younger sisters. But once Jobs stabilized in 2010, Reed regained his playfulness. Despite his illness, Jobs remained involved in everyday family life, like helping Reed get reservations for a date or going to see Reed compete on a kids' quiz show. 
- Jobs was determined to attend Reed's high school graduation in June 2010, despite his health issues. He said it was one of the happiest days of his life to be there to see Reed graduate. They celebrated with a family party afterward where Reed danced with his mother and sister.

Jobs's love for his family and determination to fight his illness so he could continue to be there for them shone through, despite his ongoing health struggles. His pride in his son's accomplishments and hopes for his future were also evident.

 

- Jobs had a closer relationship with his son Reed than with his daughters. Reed had a similar temperament to Steve - introverted and intelligent. Jobs took Reed to see the plans for the new Apple campus and offered him one of his bicycles before he passed away. 

- Jobs's relationship with his daughter Erin was more distant. Erin wanted her father's attention and affection. Her main hope was that her father would take her to the Oscars. Although Jobs cancelled their planned trip to Kyoto twice, they eventually went in 2010 which made Erin really happy and helped improve her relationship with her father.

- Eve, Jobs's younger daughter, was self-assured and not intimidated by her father. She was determined to make it to the Olympics in horseback riding. Eve was good at persuading her father and understood his personality well. Jobs came to appreciate Eve's spirit which resembled his own.

- Jobs had a loyal but complicated relationship with his wife Laurene Powell. Laurene weighed in on business and family issues. She co-founded College Track, an organization helping disadvantaged kids. Although Jobs admired her work, he was generally dismissive of philanthropic work and never visited her centers. 

- In 2010, the White House wanted to arrange a meeting between President Obama and Jobs. Although Jobs was initially reluctant, he agreed to meet Obama for 45 minutes. Jobs criticized Obama for being business-unfriendly and warned him he was headed for a one-term presidency unless that changed.

 

- Steve Jobs's health issues flared up again in early 2011. He lost his appetite and experienced pain throughout his body. Despite tests finding no new tumors, he knew the cancer had returned. 

- By Christmas 2010, Jobs was down to 115 pounds, over 50 pounds below his normal weight. Though his mood improved briefly during the holidays, it was clear this was not just a temporary issue. In early 2011, new tumors were detected and his doctors struggled with how much drug therapy his frail body could handle.

- The pain from the cancer and treatments suppressed his appetite, and his health issues made it harder to gain weight and strength. His poor digestion and liver transplant also made it difficult to absorb nutrients and fight infections. His extreme weight loss exacerbated his pain by reducing fat layers around pain receptors. His psychological attitude toward food, like his youthful fasting and diets, also made eating a challenge. 

- His wife and cook tried to get him to eat high-quality protein and healthy dishes, but he often just stared at the food and dismissed it as inedible. The one time he showed interest in eating pumpkin pie, his cook made one from scratch, but it's unknown if he actually ate it. His poor eating was putting a lot of tension on his family.

- In summary, a vicious cycle of health issues, treatments, pain, and an inability and unwillingness to eat caused Jobs to become very emaciated and frail, worrying friends and family. But his attitude still remained feisty, as seen in his political discussions and desire to help with Obama's ad campaign.

 

- Steve Jobs had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and multiple medical issues. His health was deteriorating, and he went on medical leave in January 2011. 

- Jobs was reluctant to go on leave and see doctors. His wife Laurene Powell had to push him to get properly treated. His doctors had trouble coordinating his care. Eventually, Powell held a meeting and put together a new team and regimen focused on pain management and nutrition.

- Thanks to targeted cancer treatments based on gene sequencing, Jobs was able to stay ahead of the cancer for a while. But his prognosis remained uncertain. Jobs said either he would be one of the first to beat a cancer like this or one of the last to die from it.

- During his medical leave, Jobs received several visitors. His daughter Lisa came and reconciled with him. Google's Larry Page visited to get advice on being a CEO. Bill Clinton and Bill Gates also visited Jobs. Gates and Jobs had a complex, decades-long relationship as tech rivals and partners. Gates expressed amazement at Jobs's continued work on improving the iPad, even while sick. Gates visited Jobs at his home, though Jobs wasn't feeling well enough to meet one day.

- In summary, despite his health issues, Jobs continued working and pushing forward with Apple as much as he could. But he started coming to terms with his mortality and sought to resolve relationships in his life.

 

- Steve Jobs and Bill Gates spent over three hours together in Jobs's living room reminiscing. Gates said Jobs looked healthier and more energetic than expected. They discussed education and how technology could help. They also talked about their families. 

- Jobs had many plans for new products, including electronic textbooks, advanced iPhone cameras, and an easy-to-use TV. However, by July 2011 his cancer had spread and he was in a lot of pain, had little energy, and could barely eat. 

- In August 2011, Jobs asked the author to visit. Jobs showed him photos from his life, including of his father. Jobs said his father was proud of him. Jobs and the author discussed people from Jobs's past and what they now thought of him. Jobs said anyone could make great products the way Apple did, not just him.

- Jobs said he was disappointed in Obama's leadership but that he himself never had trouble offending people. Jobs said he was initially worried about cooperating with the book but wanted his kids to know him and wanted to make sure someone got his story right. He knew there would be parts he wouldn't like but said that was good so it wouldn't seem like an "in-house book."

- As Jobs's health got worse, he knew he had to resign as Apple CEO. He wanted to show how to do a "transfer of power right." He decided to resign at the August 24 board meeting and arrived by wheelchair, a surprise to most board members.

 

- Steve Jobs's intensity and perfectionism shaped his personality and the products he created. He saw the world in binary terms: things were either brilliant or terrible, with no in between. 

- Jobs believed in end-to-end integration of software and hardware in his products. He wanted Apple to control the entire experience from device to software to content. This led to a closed system with tight control, unlike the open systems of Microsoft and others.

- Though a closed system gave Apple a small market share, it allowed them to maintain huge profit margins. It also allowed for seamless integration across devices, as with the iPod and iTunes. The closed system approach eventually led to Apple overtaking Microsoft.

- Jobs's control and integrated approach produced simple, elegant products but also aggrieved those who wanted more open systems and control. Critics argue that Jobs delighted users but did not empower them. He created "sterile appliances tethered to a network of control."

- In summary, Jobs's personality, perfectionism, and desire for end-to-end control shaped both the products he created and the criticism he faced. His approach led to singular devices but also a lack of user empowerment in the eyes of critics. Overall, his legacy is defined by this debate over open versus closed systems and the simple, integrated devices he built.

 

- Steve Jobs was obsessed with creating innovative products that provided great user experiences. He didn't care as much about profits or openness. 
- Jobs believed in focusing on what customers will want in the future rather than just giving them what they ask for now. He said “people don't know what they want until you show it to them.”
- Jobs aimed to create products that combined humanities and science, with a touch of “magic.” He said great artists and engineers have a desire for expression.
- Jobs saw computers as a tool for human creativity and self-expression.  He believed in integrating hardware, software, and content to provide the best experience. 
- Jobs felt Apple exemplified the Silicon Valley spirit of innovation during different eras. He said “Apple has stood the test of time” in continuing to pioneer new products.

The summary highlights Jobs's vision to create simple but innovative products that enabled human creativity, his futuristic approach to product design, and his belief inApple as an enduring Silicon Valley innovator.

 Here’s a summary:

- It’s easy to criticize Microsoft but it’s hard to build a company that lasts. Steve Jobs has a grudging respect for what Bill Gates built, even though he thinks Microsoft’s products were never innovative or ambitious enough. 
- Gates was more focused on business than products. He ended up the richest man in the world but Jobs wonders if that was really his goal. Jobs enjoyed working with Gates, who was bright and funny, but Microsoft never valued the humanities and liberal arts. Even when they saw the Macintosh, Microsoft couldn’t copy it well. 
- Jobs has a theory about why big companies like IBM and Microsoft decline. They become monopolies, so they start caring more about sales and revenue than products and innovation. The salespeople end up running the company instead of the product engineers. This happened when Sculley took over Apple from Jobs, and when Ballmer took over Microsoft from Gates. 
- Jobs hated it when people started companies just to cash in, not to build something lasting. He wanted to build a company that would endure for generations, like Disney, HP, and Intel. 
- Jobs was brutally honest and encouraged that in others. He would openly criticize people and products that weren’t good enough. But someone had to maintain high standards. 
- Jobs kept pushing for innovation, like Bob Dylan went electric to evolve his art. If you’re not busy being born, you’re busy dying. 
- Jobs was driven to contribute to humanity and society, to express his appreciation for those who came before him. He wanted to add to the flow of human achievement however he could. 
- Jobs was 50-50 on believing in God or an afterlife. He hoped something of our consciousness survives death, but maybe it’s just an on-off switch. “Maybe that’s why I never liked to put on-off switches on Apple devices.”

- Owen Linzmayer's "Apple Confidential 2.0" 
- Michael Moritz's "Return to the Little Kingdom"
- Leander Kahney's "Inside Steve's Brain"

- PBS documentary "Triumph of the Nerds" 
- Articles from Playboy, Time, Newsweek, Fortune, The New York Times

The sources cover Jobs's life from childhood through the early days of Apple and the development of the Macintosh computer. They include interviews with and accounts by people who knew Jobs personally and worked with him to provide insights into his personality, leadership style, and vision.

 

- Audiotapes of interviews about the development of the Macintosh are archived at the Aspen Institute. The author thanks Deborah Murphy for finding them.

- The design team for the original Macintosh included Steve Jobs, Andy Hertzfeld, Bill Atkinson, Susan Kare, and others. They aimed to build an easy-to-use computer for regular people.

- John Sculley was recruited as Apple's CEO in 1983. At first, he and Jobs had a good working relationship, but tensions grew over time. 

- The Macintosh was launched in January 1984 with a dramatic Super Bowl ad. It was initially very successful and helped popularize the graphical user interface.

- Bill Gates and Microsoft built software for the Macintosh, including Word and Excel. But Gates also saw the Mac as a threat to Microsoft's DOS system, so Microsoft developed the competing Windows operating system. This led to a rivalry between Jobs and Gates.

- By 1985, Jobs's leadership at Apple was under challenge. After an attempted coup failed, Jobs resigned from Apple and founded a new computer company called NeXT.

- NeXT built an advanced but expensive computer workstation. After initial struggles, NeXT found success selling to universities and corporations. Jobs's friend Ross Perot provided crucial investment.

- Jobs tried to get IBM and then Gates's Microsoft to invest in NeXT, but they partnered with each other instead. NeXT was unable to compete with Windows-based PCs. But its technology and operating system eventually found new life when Apple acquired NeXT in 1996 and brought Jobs back as CEO.

- So in summary, after being ousted from Apple, Jobs founded NeXT, built an innovative computer and software platform, struggled in the marketplace, but ultimately used NeXT as the foundation for reviving and transforming Apple. His banishment from Apple thus set the stage for histriumphant return.

 

Steve Jobs was ousted from Apple in 1985 but returned as CEO in 1997 to help revive the company. He simplified the product line, made a deal with Microsoft, and launched a new advertising campaign. He oversaw the development of innovative new products like the iMac, iPod, and iTunes. Jobs hired designer Jonathan Ive, who helped create Apple’s stylish and iconic designs. Tim Cook joined as COO and helped streamline Apple’s operations and supply chain. Under Jobs’s leadership, Apple released a series of successful products starting in the late 1990s and 2000s that returned the company to profitability and established it as a technology leader and cultural icon.

 Here’s a summary of the book excerpt in four parts:

Part I: The Customer Experience and Store Design (Chapters 1-2)
- Steve Jobs focused on creating a great customer experience in Apple stores. He wanted them to become destinations where people would linger and community would form. 
- The first two stores were designed by Ron Johnson with stone, wood, steel, and glass. They featured Genius Bars, Theaters, and Kids Zones. The open space allowed customers to touch and play with products.

Part II: The Digital Hub Strategy and iPod (Chapters 3, 5-6) 
- Steve Jobs envisioned Apple as a “digital hub” for various devices. He introduced iTunes and the iPod in 2001 to kick off this strategy.
- The iPod was a pivot from digital cameras and MP3 players. Jobs focused on its simplicity, small size, and “1,000 songs in your pocket” message. It was a cultural phenomenon that reinvigorated Apple.

Part III: iTunes Store and Music (Chapters 7-9)
- Jobs made deals with record labels to launch the iTunes Music Store in 2003. It offered 99 cent songs and became the top music retailer in the U.S.
- Jobs viewed the store as a way to sell iPods. He persuaded wary record labels by arguing it would revive the industry and shut down piracy. The store became the model for future Apple content stores.

Part IV: Pixar, 21st Century Macs, and the iPhone (Chapters 10-11, 15, 19)
- Jobs bought Pixar in 1986 and stayed CEO after returning to Apple. Pixar released hit movies like Toy Story, and Jobs managed creative differences. Disney bought Pixar in 2006, making Jobs Disney’s largest shareholder.
- The iMac, released in 1998, marked Apple’s return to relevance. Sleek designs and the switch to Intel processors revived the Mac. 
- The iPhone, introduced in 2007, was a revolutionary touchscreen smartphone. It featured multi-touch, visual voicemail, and a desktop-class email app. The iPhone propelled the post-PC revolution and became Apple’s most successful product.

 Here is a summary of the sources:

- Grossman argues the iPad is an oversized iPod Touch that is unnecessary but will still appeal to Apple diehards. Lyons says the iPad is disappointing and underwhelming, lacking features and connectivity of a real computer. A Fortune Techmate debate finds the iPad useful for niche activities like gaming and reading but it won’t replace full-featured computers. Wozniak praises the iPad and says  it could replace 90% of computers. The White House embraced the iPad when it launched in  2010. Noer compares the iPad launch to the stable boy who only shovels manure but dreams of grandeur.  

- Interviews indicate Jobs carefully controlled advertising to focus on products, not corporate brands; and he worked closely with ad executives like Lee Clow to produce iconic ads. App developers said Jobs demanded high quality and ease of use, providing strict guidelines and personal feedback. Publishing executives said Jobs pushed companies to adapt to digital distribution, as with his proposal of an iTunes subscription model, though some disputes remained regarding revenue shares. Several articles describe these tensions.

- Google’s “open” model conflicted with Apple’s “closed” system. Though once allies, tensions emerged over Google’s entry into smartphones and other areas. Apple blocked Flash and other technologies from its devices. “Antennagate” revealed flaws in iPhone 4’s design which Jobs addressed in an open letter. “To Infinity” covers launch of iPad 2 and iCloud, as well as plans for a new Apple campus.  

- Discussions of family and health matters, including Jobs’s relationship with daughter Lisa and his 2011 medical leave. Also mentions meetings with Obama and Bill Gates. Final sections discuss Jobs’s legacy and impact. Zittrain and  Doctorow argue that Apple exerts too much control over its platforms.
