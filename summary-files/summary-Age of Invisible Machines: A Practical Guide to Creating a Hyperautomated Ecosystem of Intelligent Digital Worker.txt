Conversational AI is a vast, emergent set of technologies obscured by layers of hype and misinformation. There's a very reasonable sense of urgency surrounding its adoption and implementation within the business community, but putting it to work requires a fuller understanding of what it actually entails. In reality, successful implementation of conversational AI requires an open ecosystem built for hyperautomation, where a shared library

Conversational AI is a type of artificial intelligence that is used to simulate a conversation between two or more people. It is important to be able to quickly orchestrate and make continual improvements to these orchestrations. This is done by strategically sequencing technologies inside your ecosystem; hyperautomating means you're doing this quickly while constantly implementing iterative improvements. When you start thinking about conversational AI

The text discusses how phones of varying degrees of sophistication are key interface points for ecosystems where conversational AI is being sequenced.
