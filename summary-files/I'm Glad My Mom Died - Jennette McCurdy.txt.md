• She considers speaking out about her experience but does not want to cement herself as "the girl from Nickelodeon" or "Sam from iCarly." She hates being known that way.

• She refuses to take pictures with fans who call her "Sam," "iCarly girl," or reference her character. She will only take pictures with those who call her by her real name out of courtesy.

• She has grown bitter and resentful. She feels the show robbed her of a normal adolescence where everything she did was not scrutinized and discussed.

• She started to dislike fame at 16, but now, at 21, she despises it. She hates being famous for something she did as a kid, like her middle school years. However, she cannot outgrow that image in the public eye.

• She knows she sounds annoying and whiny, complaining about fame when many dreams of it. However, she did not dream of fame; her mother did.

• In summary, she struggles to move on from her childhood fame and role. She wants to be known as herself, not her character. However, the publicity around the show's end and her public image make that problematic.

- The narrator has landed a leading role in a new Netflix series filming in Toronto. Though initially concerned about the script, she decided to take the job for the paycheck and opportunity.
- She arrives in Toronto excited and inspired, buying self-help books and committing to focus on herself.
  However, on the first day of shooting, she realizes the show is a partnership between Netflix and Canadian network CityTV, not a Netflix original series. She is ashamed and disappointed in her career.
- Just as she is about to purge to cope with her shame, she is called to set for filming. There, she sees an attractive man, Steven, and is instantly interested in him.

Here is a summary in broken Italian and English:

Steven viene a trovarmi dopo tre settimane che siamo stati separati. All'inizio, siamo timidi. Dopo un po ', iniziamo a baciarci. Facciamo l'amore tre volte. Tutto sembra tornare alla normalità. Facile. Comfortevole. L'imbarazzo era solo la tensione sessuale.

Dopo un po ', Steven va in bagno a fare pipì. Torna lentamente con un'espressione preoccupata. Si ferma nell'architrave del soggiorno, mantenendo le distanze da me. Sembra guardingo. Non dice niente.

Alla fine, chiedo: "Che c'è?"

“Jenny ...”, dice Steven preoccupato.

Chiedo di nuovo: “Che c'è?" Mi sta spaventando. Cosa sta succedendo? "

“È solo che ...”, Steven abbassa lo sguardo e strofina le calze contro il pavimento di ciliegio. Non ho idea di cosa stia per dire Steven e la sua esitazione mi innervosisce. Voglio solo che lo tiri fuori.

Alla fine chiede: "Hai un problema?"

"Un problema?" chiedo.

"Sì. Un problema."

"Non sono sicuro di cosa intendi ..."

"C'è del vomito rimasto sul sedile del water."

"Ooooh, è questo?" Chiedo, cercando di prenderla con leggerezza. “Beh, non lo considererei davvero un problema, è più una ... cosa che faccio.”

Non ci crede.

"Sai, come fumi tu." Cerco di mettermi al suo livello. "Fumi sigarette e io mi faccio vomitare. Sono solo cose che facciamo."

"No, sono diverse", mi assicura Steven. "La bulimia può ucciderti."

"Anche le sigarette possono."

"Sì, ma io smetterò."

"Giusto. Anch'io."

Steven Hospira.

"Voglio davvero che tu stia bene e in salute, Jenny."

"Beh, per la maggior parte lo sono".

"Ma nonlo sei."

"Ma per la maggior parte lo sono".

Mi dà un lungo sguardo severo.

- She started seeing a therapist, Laura, a month ago at her boyfriend Steven's urging. The first few weeks of therapy have revealed how severe her issues are. She binges, purges, and drinks excessively daily.

- Red carpet events are a significant trigger for her unhealthy behaviors. So Laura has agreed to attend events with her to offer support.

- The protagonist has a panic attack at this event because she has not purged all day, as Laura must attend with her. The panic attack shows how entrenched her bulimia has become.

- The narrator goes 24 hours without purging for the first time in three years. She is proud of this accomplishment but also worried she will not be able to do it again. It was really difficult for her.
