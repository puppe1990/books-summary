Here'sHere is a summary of the key ideas:

- We are prone to many systematic errors in thinking, which the author calls "cognitive errors". These are occasional mistakes and patterns of flawed reasoning that we repeat frequently.

- The author became interested in these cognitive errors after meeting Nassim Taleb and discussing limitations in human reasoning with him. Taleb went on to write The Black Swan, which explores the impact of highly improbable events. 

- The author defines cognitive errors as "systematic deviations from logic—from optimal, rational, reasonable thought and behavior." We stumble over these errors time and again, repeating them throughout history.

- Examples of common cognitive errors include:

- Overestimating our knowledge 
- Being more strongly influenced by the possibility of loss than the possibility of gain (loss aversion)
- Adjusting our behavior to match that of others in social situations (social influence)
- Relying on anecdotes rather than statistical evidence (base rate neglect)

- The errors follow predictable patterns, with our thinking systematically flawed in specific ways. However, by understanding these cognitive errors, we can avoid or mitigate them.

- The rest of the book explores 99 different cognitive errors in more depth, with examples and advice for overcoming each one.

 

- The author compiled a list of cognitive errors and mental mistakes that people make to avoid poor decision making in their personal and professional life. 
- He shares that the list needs to be completed but helps make people more aware of their irrational tendencies. 
- He emphasizes three things: 1) The list is not complete and new errors will be found; 2) The errors are interconnected; 3) The author is a novelist and entrepreneur, not a scientist. He has synthesized research done by others. 
- The author says the book is not a how-to guide but aims to help people avoid some self-inflicted unhappiness by recognizing and avoiding significant thinking errors. 
- He introduces the first thinking error: survivorship bias. This refers to the tendency to focus on successful people/companies/outcomes and overlook the many unsuccessful cases, thus distorting our view of the likelihood of success. 
- Examples: Judging the probability of becoming a rock star based only on successful rock stars; Judging a startup's chance of success based only on successful startups; Judging the representativeness of the stock market based only on surviving companies. 
- The key is considering the many unsuccessful cases, not just successful survivors. Look at the "graveyard" of failed attempts to gain perspective.
- Swimmer's body illusion: Confusing selection factors with results. Examples: Thinking models are beautiful because of the cosmetics they advertise rather than their natural attractiveness; Thinking Harvard students are successful because of Harvard rather than the school selecting already bright students. 
- The key is recognizing when a factor is a selection mechanism versus the result or outcome. Advertising and perceptions are often built on this illusion.

 

- MBAs lure students by touting high future incomes, but this is misleading. The income gap between MBAs and non-MBAs is due to many other factors besides the degree. This is an example of the "swimmer's body illusion," where a selection factor is confused for a result.  

- Happy people often attribute happiness to positive thinking, but studies show it is largely innate. Telling unhappy people to think positively is futile and spreads the swimmer's body illusion. 

- We should be wary of advice urging us to strive for certain ideals like happiness, wealth or beauty. This often spreads the swimmer's body illusion.

- The "clustering illusion" refers to our tendency to perceive patterns where none exist, as in seeing shapes in clouds. This can have real-world consequences, e.g. perceiving false patterns in the stock market.

- The sequence "oxxxoxxxoxxoooxooxxoo" appears non-random, but could result from chance. We need help accepting that coincidences and clusters can happen randomly.  

- The Germans' bombing of London in WW2 appeared to follow a pattern, terrifying citizens, but was later found to be random. Our pattern-seeking tendencies made people perceive a pattern that was not there.

- "Social proof" refers to our tendency to assume that others' behavior in a given situation is appropriate and correct. We follow the crowd, even if it is acting foolishly. This tendency evolved as a useful heuristic but often leads us astray.

- An experiment showed how people would answer incorrectly to conform to a group. Social proof can override common sense.

Social proof still has some benefits, e.g., following locals to good restaurants in unfamiliar places, but it is often exploited through mechanisms like canned laughter to manipulate people.

- In conclusion, we should cultivate skepticism about perceived patterns and not blindly follow social proofs. Step back and consider whether there are more straightforward explanations, like randomness or manipulation.

 

The crowd roared in approval, but individuals likely would not have agreed to the proposal if asked anonymously. Companies benefit from our tendency to follow social proof, using popularity to imply quality or superiority. Be skeptical of such claims. 

The sunk cost fallacy leads us to continue with a project due to past investments of time or money, even when the project no longer makes sense. We should evaluate decisions based only on future costs and benefits, forgetting past investments. Governments and investors often fall prey to this fallacy.

The rule of reciprocity means we feel obligated to return favors and gifts. Organizations exploit this by first giving small gifts to prompt donations or sales. While reciprocity enables cooperation, it also leads to unwanted obligations and retaliation. We should avoid accepting initial gifts when possible.

Confirmation bias leads us to interpret information in a way that confirms what we already believe. We ignore contradictory evidence and see only confirming evidence. This can lead to poor decisions and flawed strategies in business and investing. We must consider evidence that contradicts our views to make sound judgments.  

In summary, be wary of following the crowd, do not let past investments dictate future choices, avoid unwanted obligations, and be open to evidence that contradicts your beliefs. Objective, rational thinking can overcome these mental errors and improve outcomes.

 

The author argues that we should be wary of confirmation bias, the tendency to ignore evidence contradicting our beliefs. We should actively seek out disconfirming evidence and alternative perspectives. For example:

- Charles Darwin actively looked for observations that contradicted his theories. 
- In an experiment, students had to guess the rule behind a number sequence. Most only sought confirming evidence for their guesses. One student sought disconfirming evidence and eventually discovered the actual rule. 
- We often dismiss disconfirming evidence as "exceptions" or "special cases." However, we should pay close attention to these. 
- Confirmation bias affects many areas of life: religious beliefs, philosophies, business journalism, self-help books, internet communities, etc. We should "murder our darlings" - question our most cherished beliefs.

The authority bias leads us to blindly accept what experts and leaders tell us, even when the evidence contradicts them or their poor track records. For example:

- Economists failed to predict the 2008 financial crisis. Doctors used to do more harm than good. 
- In Milgram's experiment, people administered dangerous shocks just because an authority figure told them to. 
- Airlines have worked to counter the authority bias through crew resource management, encouraging pilots and staff to question captains. 
- Many companies are at risk due to CEOs discouraging feedback and criticism. 
- We grant authority through symbols like titles, degrees, uniforms, fame, etc. However, we should question authority figures and their influence.

The contrast effect causes us to perceive something as better or worse than it is due by contrasting it with something else. For example:

- A real estate agent might show you a very undesirable property first to make another seem more appealing by contrast. 
- Going from a warm room to a cool one makes the cool room seem even colder. Watching an energetic speaker after a low-energy one makes the second seem more lively and charismatic.
- To avoid the contrast effect, evaluate options separately rather than comparatively. Focus on an option's intrinsic qualities, not how it compares to something else.

In summary, we should resist cognitive biases by seeking disconfirming evidence, questioning authorities, and evaluating things independently rather than comparatively. This leads to clearer thinking and better decision making.

 Here is a summary of the story:

- Sid and Harry are two brothers who run a clothing store in 1930s America. 
- Sid is in charge of sales and tricks customers into buying suits at inflated prices by pretending he can't hear his brother Harry announce the price. 
- Sid and Harry exploit the contrast effect, which causes people to perceive something as more valuable than less valuable. 
- The contrast effect leads people to make irrational judgments and decisions in many areas of life. For example, we underestimate gradual changes but overestimate spectacular events. 
- The availability bias causes us to create a distorted view of the world based on examples that quickly come to mind. This leads us to overestimate risks like plane crashes while underestimating more common risks like a disease. 
- The availability bias affects many areas, including medicine, business, and public opinion. We rely on information that is easy to obtain, even if it is incorrect or irrelevant.
- The "it will get worse before it gets better" fallacy led the author to trust an incompetent doctor's incorrect diagnosis and delay the proper treatment of appendicitis. This fallacy can mislead people in many domains.
- The story illustrates several common judgment errors and cognitive biases influencing human thinking and decision making. Overcoming these biases requires conscious effort and considering alternative perspectives.

 

The consultant claims that things will get worse before they get better. This is a false claim used to justify poor performance or avoid accountability. Leaders often use this tactic to predict "difficult times" ahead and ask for patience and sacrifice. Religious figures also use this, saying the world must be destroyed before we experience heaven. We should be wary of these claims, though sometimes situations worsen before improving, as in career or business changes. However, we can see quickly if measures are working in these cases. 

We like to shape details into meaningful stories that simplify reality. We do this with our lives and history, creating an illusion of understanding. The media focuses on entertaining stories over relevant facts. For example, reports on a bridge collapse center around the driver's life instead of the cause of the accident. Stories are more memorable, like E.M. Forster's king and queen dying examples. Advertisers also use stories to sell products. We should question stories, who is sending them, their intentions, and what is being left out. Stories give a false sense of understanding and lead to riskier decisions.

The hindsight bias makes past events seem inevitable and foreseeable. For example, experts now list obvious causes of the 2007 financial crisis, though they did not predict it. Success seems destined for Google or Reagan now, though it was not at the time. Even small events like an assassination seem fated, though people then could not have imagined the consequences. The hindsight bias makes us overconfident in our predictive abilities and leads to arrogance and risk-taking. It affects even those aware of it. 

To overcome hindsight bias:
Keep a journal recording your predictions and comparing them to what happens.
See how poor a forecaster you are.
Read historical documents from the time, not just interpretations from today.
This helps avoid the illusion of retrospective inevitable.

 

- People systematically overestimate their knowledge and abilities. This is known as the overconfidence effect. Experts suffer from it even more than laypeople. 
- The overconfidence effect leads people to make overly optimistic forecasts and predictions. Most significant projects end up taking longer and costing more than predicted.
- There are two types of knowledge: actual knowledge from those who have studied a topic extensively and "chauffeur knowledge" from those who have a superficial understanding but can make an articulate presentation. News anchors and some journalists spread chauffeur knowledge. 
- Stay within your "circle of competence"—the areas you thoroughly understand. Do not make confident pronouncements on topics you do not fully understand.
- People often suffer from an "illusion of control," believing they influence events that are actually due to chance or outside factors. For example, some think they can pick winning lottery numbers or influence the dice thrown in casinos. However, in reality, they have little control.

The key message is that you likely overestimate how much you know and how much control or influence you have over events. Curb your confidence, especially on complex topics outside your area of expertise. Moreover, recognize when outcomes are due more to luck than skill. Developing a more realistic assessment of your knowledge and abilities can help avoid poor decision-making and prevent disappointment when faced with unpredictable events.

 

- People often wrongly believe that they have control or influence over events that are actually random or outside their control. This is known as the illusion of control. 
- Researchers discovered this tendency in an experiment where subjects thought they could influence a light flashing randomly. This illusion also leads people to believe that gestures or thoughts can influence events like sports games, dice rolls, or luck.
- The illusion of control leads people to believe placebo buttons, like crosswalks, elevators, and office thermostats, work when many do not. Governments and companies use these placebo buttons to placate people.  
- The incentive super-response tendency refers to how quickly and dramatically people change their behavior in response to incentives. People often respond more to the incentives themselves than the intent behind them. Sound incentive systems consider both intent and reward. Poor ones often overlook or pervert the underlying aim.
- Be wary of incentives for things like finding artifacts, loan sales, or investment products, as people often game the system for their benefit. It is best to pay consultants, doctors, and lawyers fixed fees rather than by the hour.  
- The regression to the mean delusion refers to the tendency of extreme outcomes or performances to be followed by less extreme ones. People often wrongly attribute improvements after shallow points to interventions like therapy, training, or rituals when really it's just a return to the average. 
- In summary, be skeptical of claims that therapies, training, incentives, or rituals caused major turnarounds or improvements, especially after extreme low points. Natural fluctuations and regression to the mean are more often the cause. Focus on the few things you can genuinely influence and control.

 

- People's performance or motivation levels often regress to the mean over time. Apparent improvements may just be due to chance fluctuations and not actually due to any intervention. This is known as regression to the mean.

- Outcome bias refers to judging a decision based primarily on its outcome rather than the decision-making process. However, outcomes are often due to chance or factors outside our control. It is better to evaluate decisions based on the rationale and information available at the time. 

- The paradox of choice refers to the fact that while some choice is good, too much choice can be paralyzing and lead to poor decisions and less satisfaction. Having too many options can make it hard to choose and lead to regret over the option not chosen. It is best to determine your criteria before choosing and not aim for a "perfect" choice.

- The liking bias refers to the tendency to like people like us. We are more easily persuaded by and tend to favor people we find likable. Salespeople and others can take advantage of this bias. However, we should evaluate advice and recommendations based on their merits alone rather than how much we like the person giving them.

We should know these common judgment errors and biases to make better decisions. We should focus on relevant information and evidence rather than outcomes, be cautious of too much choice, and be wary of liking bias. More rational and objective thinking can help overcome these biases.

 

The author discusses how we tend to like people more if:
A) They are attractive 
B) They are similar to us
C) They like us

This is known as the liking bias. Advertisers and salespeople frequently exploit this bias by using attractive models, portraying "people like us," and giving compliments. The more we like someone, the more likely we are to buy from them or help them.

The author then discusses several examples of the liking bias in action:

- Tupperware's success is attributed to people buying from friends at parties. 
- Aid organizations use pictures of children and women, not wounded soldiers because we like them more.
- Politicians portray themselves as similar to their audiences and give compliments to make people like them.
- A salesperson closed an oil deal by bonding over a shared interest in sailing, showing how likability can work better than bribery.

The author warns us to judge products based on merit rather than how much we like the salesperson. We should "banish the salespeople from [our] mind."

The author then discusses the endowment effect - we value things more once we own them. Some examples:
- A man paid $40,000 for a used BMW but refused an offer of $53,000 the next day.  
- In an experiment, students who won basketball tickets valued them at $2,400, but students without tickets would only pay $170. 
- Sellers ask for higher home prices because they have an emotional attachment, even though the market value is lower.
- In another experiment, students who received coffee mugs required $5.25 to sell them, but students without mugs would only pay $2.25.

The endowment effect explains why we accumulate clutter and that collectors rarely sell items. Auction bidders can get caught in the endowment effect and bid more than they intended. Job candidates can also feel more disappointed after making it further in the interview process, even though the outcome is the same.

The author concludes that we should be open to the things we own since they can be taken from us anytime. 

Finally, the author discusses how unlikely events seem meaningful through coincidence, using examples like all 15 members of a choir arriving late and avoiding death in an explosion, thinking of an old friend right before they call, and confidential documents being delivered to the wrong person, who shares a name and hotel with a rival company's employee. While these seem like signs, they can be explained rationally through coincidence and probability.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

Potential events:  

Choir delayed, and the church exploded: This is what happened.  
The choir delayed and the church did not explode 
The choir was on time, and the church exploded
Choir on time and church did not explode: This happens millions of times daily.  

Frequencies:
Choir delayed and the church exploded: 1 
Choir delayed and the church did not explode: Unlikely but possible, maybe once a century.
Choir on time and church exploded: Extremely unlikely 
Choir on time and church did not explode: Millions of times per day

Improbable coincidences: 
- Are rare but can happen; not surprising when they do
- People tend to underestimate how often they can occur due to large numbers of opportunities 
- For any improbable event, the alternatives where it does not happen are far more likely

Groupthink:
- Occurs when intelligent people make bad decisions due to a desire for consensus and group belonging
- Leads to illusions like invincibility, unanimity, and belief that the group can do no wrong
- Example is the Bay of Pigs invasion, where Kennedy and their advisors wrongly assumed the plan would succeed 
- To avoid, appoint a "devil's advocate" and encourage dissent and questioning of assumptions

Neglect of probability:
- People focus on the magnitude of the outcome but ignore likelihood, drawn to big jackpots, however improbable
- Experiments show people respond equally whether a told shock is 100% vs. 50% likely 
- Leads to bad decisions, investing in low-chance startups or canceling flights after crashes 
- Zero-risk bias: We see 0% as infinitely better than a tiny risk like 1%, even if the alternative reduces risk more
- Example is the 1958 food law banning cancer-causing substances to achieve zero risk, though tiny risks remain

In summary, we tend to underestimate improbable events, make poor decisions due to the desire for group consensus,  and focus on outcome sizes rather than probabilities. Recognizing these flaws can help avoid their pitfalls.

 

- Banning toxic chemicals in food sounds good in theory but often leads to unintended consequences, like using more dangerous chemicals that are not technically banned. It is also practically impossible to enforce fully and can increase costs drastically.

- People irrationally fear low-probability but high-consequence events, like contamination from toxic chemicals. However, two researchers found that people fear a 99% chance of contamination as much as a 1% chance. 

- The scarcity effect makes people irrationally value things more highly when they seem scarce or in short supply. For example, children fought over one blue marble among many identical marbles. Marketing often uses scarcity to convince people that they must act quickly before an opportunity is gone.

- The base-rate fallacy leads people to ignore the overall prevalence of groups when making judgments about individuals. For example, people assumed a man named Mark, who enjoys Mozart was likelier to be a literature professor than a truck driver, even though truck drivers far outnumber literature professors. Doctors are trained to consider base rates to avoid diagnosing exotic diseases before exploring more likely options.

- The gambler's fallacy leads people to believe that past random events will influence the probability of future random events. For example, people believed that after 20 spins of black on a roulette wheel, red was "due" on the next spin. However, each spin is an independent, random event. 

In summary, these cognitive biases show how human judgment can be flawed in systematic ways. However, with awareness and training, these biases can be mitigated.

 

- It took 27 roulette wheel spins before the ball landed on red. The players bet millions and went bankrupt within a few spins. This shows the gambler's fallacy - the belief that independent events will balance out.

- A sample of 50 students had an average IQ of 101, not the expected 100 because the first student tested had an IQ of 150. The remaining 49 had an average IQ of 100. This shows that small samples can differ from the population average. 

- The gambler's fallacy leads people to bet that a coin will land on tails after landing on heads a few times. However, each toss is independent, so the odds are 50-50. 

- Mathematicians can fall for the deformation professionnelle - the tendency to apply mathematical reasoning where it does not fit. Common sense suggests betting on heads if a coin has landed on heads 50 times in a row, indicating it is loaded.

- We use anchors - bits of information we are sure of - to make guesses when we need complete knowledge. For example, knowing the Civil War was in the 1860s anchors the guess that Lincoln was born around 1805. 

- Experiments show anchors influence people's estimates of unknown values. The numbers on a Wheel of Fortune anchor guess the number of UN members. The last digits of a phone number anchor the year Attila the Hun was defeated. Listing prices anchor estimates of house values, even for experts.

- Consultants use anchors by mentioning an initial high price to start negotiations. Repeat customers get anchored to paying that price.

- Inductive thinking - drawing universal conclusions from individual observations - can lead to poor decisions, like a goose being fattened up and then slaughtered or someone investing their life savings in a stock that has gone up for six months. 

- Inductive thinking can also be used to scam people by sending different stock market predictions to groups of people, then targeting the groups that received correct predictions to build the impression of predictive ability. Some will then trust the scammer with their money.

 Here is a summary of life in Brazil:

Brazil is the largest country in South America. It has a diverse landscape ranging from rainforests, mountains, and beaches. Brazil's culture is also very diverse, influenced by Portuguese colonists, indigenous tribes, and enslaved Africans. Brazilians value leisure time, family, music, soccer, and religion. Most Brazilians are Roman Catholics.

Brazil has a very multiethnic population. The largest ethnic groups are European Brazilians, African Brazilians, and Brazilians of mixed ethnicities. There is also a large indigenous population of over 800,000. Brazil's official language is Portuguese, and most Brazilians speak Portuguese. 

Brazil's economy has developed rapidly over the past few decades. However, there is still a large gap between the rich and the poor. Over 25% of Brazil's population lives below the poverty line. Brazil's primary economic activities are mining, coffee production, tourism, and manufacturing. Tourism employs over 1 million Brazilians, with beautiful rainforests, waterfalls, and over 4,000 miles of coastline attracting visitors.

Crime and income inequality are significant challenges in Brazil. There are high rates of violent crime, especially in urban areas. The government struggles to provide security and economic opportunity for much of the population. Access to education also remains a challenge, especially in poor, rural areas.

Brazil is a diverse country with a vibrant culture, natural beauty, and economic opportunity. However, it continues to grapple with crime, poverty, inequality, and other challenges common in developing nations. Life in Brazil can vary greatly depending on one's socioeconomic status and location.

 A

 Here is a summary of the passage:

- The halo effect tends to form an overall impression of someone or something based on a single characteristic. 
- Our judgments can be disproportionately influenced by one factor, like attractiveness, status, or age. 
- This effect leads us to make assumptions not supported by facts. 
- For example, attractive people are often viewed as likable, intelligent, and competent without evidence. They tend to advance more quickly in their careers due to this bias.
- The halo effect also influences how we judge businesses, products, and public figures. Our view of them can shift drastically based on a single factor like stock price or reputation. 
- This effect often works unconsciously through subtle associations and can lead to stereotyping. However, it may also have some short-term benefits, like when experiencing intense feelings of infatuation.
- In summary, the halo effect highlights how our reasoning and judgment can be flawed or disproportionate due to relying too heavily on first impressions or salient attributes. We should be aware of this tendency in order to make fair and balanced evaluations.

The key takeaway is that the halo effect causes us to let one trait, like attractiveness or status, color our view of someone or something exaggeratedly. Our judgments become imbalanced as a result. Recognizing this tendency can help us avoid biases and make sounder decisions.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

The passage cautions us against rushing to judge individuals or companies based solely on prominent or salient features. To gain a balanced and accurate assessment, we must look beyond superficial attributes and "dig deeper" through serious research. World-class orchestras achieve an unbiased evaluation by having candidates play behind a screen, so evaluators focus solely on the performance. Similarly, business journalists should look beyond easily obtained quarterly figures to properly assess a company and do in-depth research. What emerges may sometimes be flattering but will be enlightening.

The passage then illustrates how we fail to consider "alternative paths" - the outcomes that could have happened but did not. We see only the actual outcome, not the risks and probabilities leading to that result. The example of winning $10 million in Russian roulette shows that although the outcome was the same (winning money), the alternative paths were vastly different (with one leading to death). We must consider the role of risk and probability in determining an outcome's value or worth.

The passage warns us to be wary of predictions and forecasts, especially from self-proclaimed "experts" and media darlings. Studies show that expert forecasts are often no more accurate than random guesses. However, experts face few consequences for inaccurate predictions. They have incentives to make many prophecies, and some will be correct by chance. The more complex the system or long-term the forecast, the less predictable and reliable it becomes. The passage advises considering the expert's track record and incentives in determining the credibility of a forecast.

Finally, the passage describes the "conjunction fallacy" - the tendency to believe that a subset (or conjunction of factors) is more likely than the whole set. This is illustrated through an example of a man named Chris, where people tend to believe Chris is more likely to work Chris more likely to work for a major bank's Third World foundation (subset) rather than just working for a central bank (entire set). We fall prey to this fallacy because we favor "plausible" or "harmonious" stories over logical reasoning. 

In summary, the key takeaways are: look beyond superficial features to gain a balanced view, consider alternative paths and outcomes, be wary of expert predictions and forecasts, and be aware of the conjunction fallacy in reasoning. Consider plausibility versus probability.

 

- How information is presented (framing) significantly impacts how we perceive and understand it. Slight changes in wording can lead to very different interpretations and decisions. 
- There are two modes of thinking: intuitive (fast, automatic) and conscious (slow, logical). Intuitive thinking often leads us to make mistakes by drawing quick conclusions before the conscious mind catches up. We tend to believe "plausible" stories without considering alternatives. 
- The "conjunction fallacy" refers to the tendency to assume that specific conditions or details make an event more likely when the opposite is true. The more conditions must be met, the less probable the overall scenario. 
- The "action bias" refers to the tendency to prefer action over inaction, even if action achieves little or makes the situation worse. We feel compelled to "do something" in the face of uncertainty. This was useful for our hunter-gatherer ancestors but often leads to poor decisions today. 
- Examples of action bias include:
› Soccer goalkeepers diving to one side or the other on penalty kick even though the ball is just as likely to go down the middle. It just feels better to act.
› Overzealous police officers rushing into uncertain situations that senior officers would monitor before intervening. Early action often exacerbates the problem. 
› Doctors prescribe unnecessary treatment when a diagnosis is unclear to feel like they are taking action. It is often better to wait and monitor in uncertain medical situations.
› Investors making rash decisions when first starting due to uncertainty. More experienced investors have the discipline to avoid "just doing any damn thing."

In summary, be aware of the tendency to make flawed intuitive judgments, believe in "plausible" stories and details, and feel compelled to take immediate action. With awareness, we can cultivate more logical and disciplined thinking. We should consider alternatives, avoid assuming more conditions make an event more likely, and have the patience to monitor uncertain situations rather than rushing to act.

 

Although our instincts tell us to act quickly in uncertain situations, it is often better to resist the urge to act rashly. Society values decisive action and rewards those who act boldly, even if their actions prove misguided or counterproductive. However, it is usually wiser to resist pressure to act impulsively and instead take time to evaluate situations carefully before deciding on a course of action. 

The passage discusses several cognitive biases that influence our tendencies to act or not act in specific ways:

- Omission bias: We judge harmful actions as worse than equally harmful inactions or omissions. For example, actively euthanizing a patient seems worse than passively allowing a patient to die by withholding treatment. This bias leads us to prefer inaction even when it leads to the same poor outcomes as action.

- Self-serving bias: We tend to attribute successes to ourselves but failures to external factors outside our control. For example, CEOs quickly take credit for successful years but blame external factors like the economy for unsuccessful years. This bias causes us to overestimate our contributions and blame others rather than accept responsibility for failures. 

- Hedonic treadmill: We cannot accurately predict how long we will feel the effects of highly emotional life events, whether positive or negative. For example, we think winning the lottery will make us elated for years or that the death of a loved one will make us sad for a long time. In reality, we tend to quickly adapt to life circumstances, good and evil, and return to a baseline level of happiness. Our inability to foresee this adaptation causes us to make inaccurate predictions about the long-term impacts of events on our well-being.

In summary, the key message is that we should slow down, evaluate situations objectively, and not act impulsively based on biases and inaccurate predictions about the outcomes of our actions. Resisting urgency and taking time to reason can lead to better decisions and outcomes.

 Here is a summary:

- Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert found that people's predicted happiness from significant life events tends to fade within a few months. This is known as the "hedonic treadmill" effect. For example, lottery winners and people who buy expensive new houses or cars initially feel happy but adapt to their baseline happiness levels within months. 

- Negative events like injuries, job loss, or relationship end also tend to affect people's happiness less over the long run than predicted. After a few months, people tend to adapt and return to their normal levels of happiness or unhappiness.

- Some tips for making better decisions based on this:

1) Avoid things you cannot adapt to, like long commutes, chronic stress, or noise. These tend to decrease happiness in the long run.

2) Do not expect significant purchases or life events to significantly or permanently increase your happiness. The happiness boost will fade within months. 

3) Pursue free time, autonomy, relationships, and passions. These have a more significant impact on long-term happiness.

4) Be wary of the self-selection bias. We often perceive that we have worse luck than others in traffic, lines, dating pools, etc. However, this is often because we disproportionately notice the times we get "unlucky." In reality, our luck is often average. 

5) Be aware of association bias. Our brains naturally link things that happen together, even if they're not really connected. This can lead to superstitions, prejudices, and poor decisions. Try to evaluate the actual likelihood of connections, not just go by associations.

In summary, researchers have found that people are generally not very good at predicting what will make them happy or unhappy in the long run. However, we can gain insights and make better choices by being aware of the effects of adaptation, self-selection bias, and association bias. The keys to lasting happiness are relationships, experiences, autonomy, and pursuing passions - not major purchases, life events, or material goods.

 

- Door-to-door salespeople used to go from house to house selling their goods. One salesman, George Foster, rang the doorbell of a vacant house filled with gas from a leak. The spark from the bell ignited an explosion that hospitalized George. Though the chances of it happening again were low, George developed a fear of ringing doorbells that prevented him from doing his job for years. 

- The lesson is that we should gain wisdom from experiences but be careful not to overgeneralize like the cat that sits on a hot stove and never sits on a stove again, hot or cold.

- Beginner's luck is the tendency to make false connections between initial success and skill. People who win at first continue gambling, convinced of their ability until losses show the win was just luck. Companies that quickly acquire smaller firms may overestimate their ability and buy a more prominent firm, which leads to disaster. Stock market and housing bubbles also mislead people into thinking early wins reflect skill.

- To distinguish skill and luck, consider the following: 1) You likely have skill if you outperform others over a long time. 2) The more competitors, the more likely early wins are just luck. If you lead among many, it's probably skill; if you are among millions, luck.

- Test theories by trying to disprove them, as with scientific theories and the example of sending a manuscript to many publishers after one accepts it.

- Cognitive dissonance is resolving inconsistencies in reasoning to reduce discomfort. Like the fox calling grapes sour after failing to reach them, people may call a regretted car purchase safe to avoid admitting a mistake. In a study, students paid little to say tedious tasks were exciting and convinced themselves it was true, unlike those who paid more. People may say they did not want a job they were rejected for. The author convinced himself that losing stock had the potential to avoid admitting error. 

- "Live each day as if it were your last" is unrealistic advice. Doing so would lead to chaos. It expresses a desire for immediacy, but we overvalue immediacy. Most people choose a larger reward in 13 months over a smaller one in 12 months, showing we discount the future too steeply. We should balance living in the present and planning for the future.

- "Sundays" in the title suggests setting aside one day a week to live as if it were your last while maintaining moderation the rest of the week.

 

- Instant gratification and our desire for immediate rewards is a legacy of our animal past. Humans and animals prefer instant rewards over more significant rewards in the future. This is known as hyperbolic discounting. 
- As we age, we gain more self-control and can delay gratification for more significant future rewards. However, when offered an instant reward, the incentive must be very high for us to wait. Banks charge high interest rates on credit cards and short-term loans. 
- Justifying our requests or behavior with a reason, even a meaningless one, makes others more likely to comply or be understanding, and simply saying "because" is often enough. 
- People crave explanations and reasons, even if they are redundant or meaningless. Leaders and companies frequently provide higher purposes and stories to motivate others, even if they do not mean anything. 
- Decision-making is mentally taxing and draining. Having to make many choices depletes our willpower and self-control. This is known as decision fatigue. When suffering from decision fatigue, we are more susceptible to persuasion and impulse decisions. 
- Taking a break, relaxing, and eating can recharge your willpower after decision fatigue. Willpower declines significantly when blood sugar is low.

In summary, our tendency towards instant gratification, desire for explanations, and the mentally draining effects of decision-making can negatively influence our thinking and willpower. However, we can overcome these effects with awareness and the right strategies.

 

- Decision fatigue refers to the depletion of mental resources from making many decisions. This can lead to better-quality decision-making as the day goes on. The example given is of Israeli judges making parole decisions, who were more likely to grant requests earlier in the day and less likely to do so after many decisions had been made. 

- The "contagion bias" refers to the instinctive belief that objects or places retain the essence of people who were once strongly associated with them. The example given is of people hesitating to shoot darts at photos of their loved ones, even though, rationally, they knew the photos themselves would not be harmed. The belief in such "contagion" is hard to override with reason.

- Averages can be misleading when there are outliers that skew the data. Examples of an extraordinarily obese or wealthy person joining a group and radically altering the average, even though most members remain unchanged. In many complex systems, distributions follow a "power law" where a few extreme events account for a high proportion of the outcomes. Examples of websites with traffic, city populations, company sizes, book sales, damage from hurricanes, banker bonuses, marketing success, app downloads, and actor earnings are given. In these cases, averages become meaningless, and it is better to consider the underlying distribution.

The critical point is that we should be wary of averages and consider distributions in many real-world scenarios. Single events or outliers can dominate and make averages misleading. Our instinctive belief in "contagion" and unwillingness to override it with reason can also lead us astray. Decision fatigue is a natural phenomenon that leads to poorer choices, especially as the day progresses and mental resources are depleted.

 Here's a summary of the key ideas presented:

- Financial incentives or rewards can sometimes undermine motivation and 
crowd out intrinsic motivation. This is known as "motivation crowding." 
Examples include monetary rewards for charitable acts or bonuses
for good behavior. These incentives can backfire and reduce motivation.

- The "twaddle tendency" refers to using verbose or convoluted language to mask a 
lack of knowledge or clarity of thought. People may engage in meaningless 
rambling or "jabbering" to disguise ignorance or poorly developed ideas. Examples 
include a beauty pageant contestant's incoherent response and the complex writing 
of certain philosophers.

- The "Will Rogers phenomenon" refers to artificially improving average 
performance by removing poor performers from a group. For example, a bank 
manager could transfer poorer-performing clients from one money manager to 
another to raise the average performance of both managers without 
actually improving anyone's performance. The name comes from a quote attributed 
to Will Rogers: "When the Okies left Oklahoma and moved to California, they 
raised the average intelligence level in both states."

- In summary, the key ideas are: (1) financial incentives can sometimes undermine 
motivation, (2) people may use excessive and convoluted language to mask a lack 
of knowledge or clear thinking, and (3) averages can be artificially improved by 
removing poorer performers from a group.

 

- The Will Rogers phenomenon refers to the illusion of progress when in reality, nothing has changed. It is named after the American comedian who joked that when people move from one place to another, the average IQ of both places increases.

- A good example is a car dealership that transfers its best salesperson from one branch to another. Although the averages at both branches have increased, everything has stayed the same overall. The same logic applies to the staged progression of cancers, where earlier diagnosis creates the illusion of patients living longer.

- Information bias is the belief that more information leads to better decisions. Too much information can be irrelevant, misleading, or confusing. A study showed doctors would order unnecessary tests even when the information provides no benefit. More information also wastes time and resources. It is better to focus on the critical facts. 

- Effort justification refers to overvaluing the results of an action because of the effort put into it. For example, a soldier treasures an award he had to endure pain to receive, and a man refuses to sell a motorcycle he struggled to restore, even at a high price. The more complex something is to attain, the more we value it.

- Groups use effort justification in initiation rites to bond members. Business schools also use it by overloading students with work to make the qualification seem more valuable. The IKEA effect refers to valuing self-assembled furniture more. Managers who work hard on a proposal cannot judge it objectively. 

- In the 1950s, cake mix makers had to make preparation slightly more complex so homemakers would value convenience. The added effort provided a sense of achievement and appreciation.

- In summary, be wary of information bias and effort justification in yourself and others. Look beyond superficial measures of progress, and consider whether a real value has been added. Make important decisions based on relevant facts, not the volume of information. Moreover, try to keep the effort put into something from clouding your judgment of the result.

 Here is a summary and analysis of the key ideas:

Summary:
- The Law of Small Numbers: When dealing with small data sets or samples, random fluctuations significantly impact and lead to misleading conclusions. Do not draw broad inferences from limited data. 
- Expectations shape our perceptions and actions in powerful ways, consciously and unconsciously. They can motivate and improve performance but also lead to irrational behavior and poor decisions. Manage expectations carefully.
- Simple logic questions reveal how prone we are too intuitive rather than reflective thinking. Those who scored higher on such tests tend to prefer deferred gratification and think more logically. Developing a habit of reflective thinking can help overcome biases and make better judgments.

Analysis:

The three concepts discussed provide helpful rules of thumb for thinking more objectively and rationally:

1. Beware of the Law of Small Numbers. Do not draw broad conclusions from limited data or make decisions based on small samples. Random chance plays too significant a role, and the extremes tend to be overrepresented. Ask for more data to get a more accurate sense of the overall pattern or trend. 

2. Manage expectations carefully. Have high expectations for the things under your control to motivate performance but lower expectations for external events outside your control. Unrealistic expectations often lead to irrational behavior and poor decisions when there are surprises or discrepancies. Expecting volatility and uncertainty helps prevent emotional overreactions. 

3. Develop a habit of reflective thinking. Pause to think through problems logically and question your intuitions. Simple logic questions can reveal our tendency to think automatically rather than reflectively. Those who scored higher on such tests tend to have qualities like deferred gratification, logical reasoning ability, and objectivity - skills from reflective thinking. Building this mental muscle leads to better judgment and fewer biases.

In summary, think critically about statistics and data, manage expectations realistically, and take time for reflective thinking. These habits will help overcome common mental errors, resulting in better, more objective analysis and wiser decisions and choices. The key is developing awareness of the potential pitfalls and consistently evaluating information and options rationally.

 

People who opt for riskier options and prefer gambling tend to be less able to control their impulses. They favor instant gratification and have less rational thinking. As a result, they tend to believe more in intuition and have more religious faith. To improve rational thinking, practice questioning obvious answers and reject intuitions.

The Forer Effect explains why pseudosciences are so convincing. People tend to relate to general statements and accept flattering descriptions. Also, the absence of negative statements and our tendency to confirm preexisting beliefs make us perceive coherence where there is none. To evaluate expertise, test anonymous descriptions on a group to see if most can identify their own. 

Although volunteering seems altruistic, it can be inefficient and self-serving. It often makes more sense to work longer and donate money so professionals can contribute more effectively. However, celebrities' participation can provide invaluable publicity. For most, the best way to help is by donating money, not unskilled labor.

Emotions heavily influence our judgments through the affect heuristic. Although we aim to be rational, our spontaneous feelings about genetically modified crops guide our reasoning. To counter this, we must recognize emotions' effects and evaluate the actual pros and cons. Listing benefits and drawbacks side by side can help, as can considering more background and statistics. With effort, we can overcome biases and make wiser choices.

 

- The expected value approach to decision-making involves listing an option's pros and cons, estimating their importance and likelihood, and calculating the total expected value. However, this approach is rarely used in practice for several reasons:

1. We cannot imagine all possible outcomes and often miss unlikely, impactful events. 
2. We need more data to calculate small probabilities accurately. 
3. Our brains prefer heuristics like the effect heuristic over logical calculations. Our emotions and initial reactions strongly influence how we view the risks and benefits of options.

- The introspection illusion refers to our tendency to believe our internal observations and judgments are accurate while doubting others'. This can lead to three problematic reactions:

1. Assuming others who disagree with us lack information (ignorance). 
2. Assuming others who disagree with us lack intelligence (idiocy).
3. Assuming others disagree with us have malicious intentions (malice).

- We should be skeptical of our internal observations and treat them with the same skepticism we would apply to others' claims. We must become our own harshest critics.

- We often struggle to close doors and commit to a single option because we want to keep our options open. This tendency can prevent us from choosing or fully committing to our choices. 

- Examples like Xiang Yu burning his ships and Cortés sinking his own illustrate how removing the retreat option can help focus efforts on the current task. A study found that participants performed better in a game when previous options were no longer available.

- In summary, we should set fire to our ships and close doors when needed to commit fully to a choice and achieve the best outcome. Keeping options open often provides an illusion of control and safety but prevents us from progressing.

 

The passage describes an experiment in which players were given points to open a game's doors. At first, they opened as many doors as possible in an anxious attempt to keep their options open. This caused them to lose 15% of their points. The organizers then made opening doors cost points, but the players continued frittering away their points to open doors. The passage argues that we have an irrational obsession with keeping our options open, even when it hurts us.   

The following passage describes how futurists' predictions of radical technological changes often prove incorrect. Things that have endured for a long time, like wood, animals, agriculture, etc. are likely to endure. We place too much emphasis on new inventions and "killer apps." The rule of thumb is that whatever has lasted X years will likely last another X years. Much of the future will look like the present.

The final passage discusses the "sleeper effect"—the phenomenon where propaganda has a more significant effect over time. Studies found that WWII propaganda films did not initially change soldiers' attitudes but did so weeks later. The psychologists proposed that we forget the source of information faster than the information itself. So propaganda from an untrustworthy source gains credibility over time. The passage recommends being skeptical of unsolicited information, avoiding ad-saturated media, remembering the sources of information, and asking who benefits. 

In summary, the three passages discuss the following:

1) Our irrational obsession with keeping options open, even when it hurts us. 
2) How futurists tend to overestimate the impact of new technologies and underestimate the endurance of existing technologies and institutions. 
3) The "sleeper effect"—how propaganda and misinformation can have a more significant effect over time as we forget the source but remember the message. 

The passages recommend being more selective and skeptical in our decision-making by closing some doors, being wary of "killer apps," distrusting unsolicited information, and considering who benefits from the messages we receive.

 

1. The argument that an MBA will mean earning $400,000 more over a career hides four fallacies:

- Swimmer's body illusion: MBA candidates will likely earn more, even without an MBA. 
- Opportunity cost: The two years spent doing an MBA means lost earnings of $100,000. So the actual cost of an MBA is $200,000, not $100,000.
- Unrealistic long-term earnings projections: Estimating earnings 30+ years in the future is foolish.
- Alternative blindness: There are other options besides "do an MBA" or "do not do an MBA," like other programs that cost less or have a better cost-benefit.

2. Alternative blindness means systematically ignoring viable options and comparing only two. Examples:
- Comparing a 5% bond only to a 1% savings account rather than all investment options. 
- Comparing building a sports arena to an empty lot, rather than other land uses like a school, park, or selling the land.
- In a medical decision, comparing only "risky surgery" and "no surgery" rather than finding an alternative, like a safer procedure at another hospital.

3. Social comparison bias is the tendency to withhold help from those who might surpass you, even if it is not in your long-term interest. Examples:
- Scientists hampering the work of promising young colleagues who might threaten their status. 
CEOs hire mediocre candidates to feel superior rather than the best ones who could drive the most value.
- The key is to hire people better than yourself, as they will ultimately benefit you and the organization.

4. The primacy effect means giving greater weight to information that comes first. Examples: 
- Preferring "Alan" over "Ben" based only on the first adjectives used to describe them, even though the descriptions were the same.
- Grading students higher based only on their performance on initial test questions. 
- Hiring employees based too heavily on first impressions in an interview.
- Forming judgments in a meeting based only on the first opinions expressed.

The key is to be aware of these biases and make an effort to consider all information objectively. Look for alternatives, give weight to more than just first impressions, and support the success of others, even if it means temporary discomfort. In the long run, overcoming these biases leads to better decisions and outcomes.

 

- First and last impressions tend to dominate in people's minds. This is known as the primacy and recency effects. 
- The primacy effect means that information presented first tends to stick with people the most. The recency effect means that the most recent information is remembered well.
- The primacy effect tends to dominate when making an immediate decision or judgment. However, for the information presented a while ago, the recency effect tends to dominate. 
- To avoid biases from these effects, evaluate all information impartially and avoid relying too much on first or last impressions. For example, in interviews, score candidates throughout to avoid overweighting the beginning or end.

- People tend to favor their ideas over others, known as the not-invented-here syndrome. This leads to overlooking good ideas just because others created them.  
- To overcome this, have separate groups generate and evaluate ideas. Also, examine your past ideas critically to gain perspective. 
- On a societal level, the not-invented-here syndrome results in missing obvious good ideas because they came from other cultures or groups. Several examples were given like roundabouts taking decades to be adopted in the US and some European countries, even though they were shown to work well in the UK.

- Black swans are unforeseen, improbable events that can have massive positive and negative consequences. They are unknown unknowns that can disrupt the status quo. 
- Black swans are becoming more common and impactful. Our brains are not well adapted to anticipate and plan for them. However, we should assume they can happen and try to be positioned to benefit from positive ones and avoid negative ones when possible. 
- Some strategies for benefiting from positive black swans include:
› Becoming an entrepreneur, artist, or inventor 
› Avoiding environments prone to negative black swans like debt 
› Adopting a modest standard of living in case your big breakthrough never comes

- Knowledge and skills tend to be domain-dependent. Expertise in one area does not necessarily transfer to other areas. This is known as domain dependence.
- Several examples were given of domain dependence, like a chess grandmaster struggling in backgammon or an expert in artificial intelligence struggling in human psychology—alternatively, a medical expert in cardiology is struggling in oncology.

 

- Insights and knowledge are difficult to transfer across domains or areas of expertise. This is known as domain dependence. 
- For example, Harry Markowitz, an economist who won the Nobel Prize for his work on portfolio theory, split his investments 50/50 between stocks and bonds. He needed help with applying his theoretical work to his practical finances. 
- The author's friend is an adrenaline junkie but didn't understand the author's point about the risks of starting a business. Risks that seem acceptable in one domain do not necessarily translate to another.
- Skills and talents often do not need to transfer better across domains. A great salesperson may struggle as a CEO, for instance. Or a professor's theoretical knowledge may translate poorly to practical life decisions. 
- There is a tendency for people to overestimate how much others share their views and preferences. This is known as the false-consensus effect. For example, people who prefer music from the 1960s tend to think most others do as well. 
- The false-consensus effect makes interest groups and politicians overestimate their popularity and support. It also often impacts businesses, leading them to overestimate the appeal of new products. 
- The brain tends to revise and falsify memories to align with our current views. This creates the illusion that we have always held our present opinions and beliefs. Studies show that people often need to remember their previous views and stances on issues to match their current thoughts.
- While we have some very vivid and accurate memories, especially of highly emotional events, many are revised and rewritten to reduce cognitive dissonance and avoid admitting we were wrong or mistaken. Our brains subtly rewrite history to make it seem we were right all along.

 Here is a summary in two levels of detail:

Id: 
- Flashbulb memories feel real but are flawed and reconstructed. 
- Identifying with groups distorts thinking and perception.
- There is a difference between risk (known probabilities) and uncertainty 
(unknown probabilities). 
- We tend to prefer known probabilities (default effect).

Detailed:

Flashbulb memories:
- Feel as accurate as photos but are inaccurate and reconstructed. 
- A study found that less than 7% matched initial accounts, and 50% needed to be corrected in 
two-thirds of points. 
- We do not know why they feel so real. Half of what we remember needs to be corrected.

In-group out-group bias:
- We tend to identify with and favor our groups. This distorts our thinking.
- Groups form quickly, even based on trivial criteria. We see out-groups as more 
similar than they are.
- This bias leads to support for own group's views, prejudice, and conflict like war.
- Identifying with groups was once vital for survival but now distorts thinking.

Risk vs. uncertainty:
- Risk means probabilities are known; uncertainty means probabilities are unknown.
- We can calculate risks but not uncertainties. We try to frame uncertainties as risks, 
often wrongly. 
- Examples: Medicine (risks of diseases) vs. economy (chance of euro collapse). 
- We must learn to tolerate ambiguity and uncertainty to think clearly.

Default effect:
- We tend to prefer default options and the status quo. 
- Examples: Choosing a familiar wine from a list or sticking with the default iPhone 
settings.
- This is because defaults feel endorsed, the path of least resistance, and ambiguity 
averse. 
- But defaults are not always the best choice, and we should consider other options.

 From what I can gather, the author has set up three examples so far to illustrate the default effect and how it influences human behavior:

1. The author's tendency to stick with default settings like the factory cell phone settings and the house wine at restaurants. The author attributes this to the "so-called default effect," where people tend to choose default options.

2. Examples of how New Jersey and Pennsylvania presented different default options for car insurance policies and how people tended to go with whatever was presented as the default. This shows how policymakers and governments can nudge people toward confident choices by establishing intelligent defaults.

3. An experiment showed how organ donation rates increased dramatically by changing the default option from an opt-in to an opt-out system. This again shows the power of defaults in influencing choices. 

The author has provided three examples to demonstrate the default effect and how it impacts decision-making. The critical point is that defaults are very powerful in nudging people toward specific options or choices, even when people have the freedom to choose otherwise.

Does this summary accurately reflect the main points and examples the author has provided regarding the default effect so far? Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.

 

Most immigrants live lawful lives, but we focus on the negative exceptions that grab our attention. This is known as the salience effect. We place undue emphasis on conspicuous information, often ignoring more subtle factors. This distorts our interpretation of the past and imagination of the future. 

Money is not rationally viewed as equivalent based on amount. How we obtain money emotionally influences how we spend it. Money won from gambling or windfalls is spent more freely, known as the house-money effect. This irrational thinking is exploited in marketing strategies offering free samples or credit.

Procrastination is the tendency to delay important but unpleasant tasks. Though we know tasks would be beneficial, limited willpower and the reward time required to lead to delays. Rest, reducing distractions, and deadlines can help overcome procrastination. Vague resolutions often fail, so break down goals into steps with deadlines.

Envy is distressed over the good fortune of others. Though irrational, it's common to wish misfortune on those who have what we lack. Envy causes harmful behavior and damages relationships. The antidote is to appreciate what you have, focus on your progress, and not compare yourself to others. Build your happiness rather than covet that of others.

In summary, we are prone to specific irrational and harmful modes of thinking like salience effects, the house-money effect, procrastination, and envy. Awareness of these tendencies and concerted efforts to overcome them can lead to a more productive and content life. Comparing yourself to others and wishing them ill will only lead to your detriment.

 

- Envy is an idiotic vice because it is easy to overcome and provides no benefits. In contrast, other emotions like anger, sadness, and fear serve essential purposes. Envy only leads to flattery and wasting time. 

- Many things can trigger envy, like ownership, status, health, talent, beauty, etc. Envy is often confused with jealousy but differs in that envy relates to things while jealousy relates to relationships. Envy requires two people, while jealousy requires three.

- Paradoxically, we envy those most similar to us, like neighbors, colleagues, and peers. We do not envy those very different from us. We envy those in our own circles and areas of competition.

- A practical error is moving to a higher social circle which often leads to envy and status anxiety. The solution is to stop comparing yourself to others and focus on your niche.

- Envy originates evolutionarily from competition over resources. Though once applicable, envy is unnecessary today and results from a perceived lack that is not real. It is better to envy the person you aspire to become.

- We prefer stories to statistics because we empathize more with people than numbers. This is due to our "theory of mind," which allows us to understand how others think and feel. Experiments show we donate more when shown a person in need rather than just statistics about a crisis. Media uses stories to entice readers by giving issues a human face. Novels also succeed by focusing on personal conflicts.

- We suffer from an "illusion of attention" in which we think we notice everything happening around us but only focus on what we are directly attending to. Unexpected events outside our focus, like a gorilla walking through a scene, often go unnoticed. This illusion can have dangerous real-world consequences like distracted driving. Essential issues in plain sight are like "gorillas in the room" urgently needing addressing, but no one sees. Examples include mismanagement leading to company failures or economic crises.

 

• We often fail to notice important things that remain unseen. We cling to the illusion that we perceive everything significant, but much escapes our attention. We should periodically challenge this illusion by considering unexpected events and scenarios, paying attention to subtle details, and thinking unconventionally.

• Strategic misrepresentation refers to exaggerating one's claims, especially when there are high stakes, to achieve a goal like getting a job or book deal. While not deceitful, it involves puffing up one's abilities and glossing over weaknesses. It is familiar with large, ambitious projects where accountability is unclear, and the timeline is far off. The most exaggerated claims often win, though they are the least realistic. We should be wary of strategic misrepresentation by looking at a person's track record and evaluating proposals skeptically. 

• Overthinking refers to pondering a situation so extensively that it interferes with intuition and practical thinking. When performing practiced skills, evaluating familiar situations, or making instinctual judgments, it is best not to overanalyze. Our intuitions and mental shortcuts have evolved to handle such decisions. For complex, unfamiliar scenarios, however, logical reasoning is better. The key is knowing when to think and when to feel.

• The planning fallacy refers to underestimating the time required to complete tasks and overestimating what one can accomplish in a given period. Despite repeated experiences of failing to achieve unrealistic plans and schedules, people continue to make the exact overly optimistic predictions. This fallacy is particularly evident in group work, where the timeline and benefits are inflated while costs and risks are downplayed. We must make room for inevitable interruptions and inaccuracies to overcome the planning fallacy.

 

- Projects often go over budget and schedule due to optimism and failure to consider external factors. A solution is to do a "premortem," where you imagine the project failed and try to figure out why. It would help to look at similar past projects to get a realistic view.

- Experts tend to see problems only through the lens of their expertise. This is known as the "deformation professionnelle." It would help if you had multiple perspectives to solve complex problems. Adding new mental models and areas of expertise helps overcome this limited thinking.

- Unfinished tasks persist in our minds until we have a plan to complete them. This is the "Zeigarnik effect." Making a detailed plan to address the task gives you peace of mind by removing it from your mental to-do list. The plan cannot be executed later, just developed. 

- Success is often more due to luck and circumstance than skill. This is the "illusion of skill." For example, serial entrepreneurs are rare not because founders lack skill but because the circumstances that led to their first success are hard to replicate. Success is often outside our control.

The key lessons are: to use multiple perspectives, make plans to address open tasks, and recognize the role of luck and circumstance in outcomes. A realistic and broad view of situations will lead to better decisions and less anxiety. Success is not always within our control or a result of skill alone. External factors play a significant role.

 

- Luck plays a much more significant role in business success than skill or hard work. Successful founders and CEOs are often not much better than average. Their success is disproportionate to their talent or effort. 

- Researchers found that CEOs of successful companies are only slightly better, on average, than CEOs of less successful companies. Success depends more on circumstances than CEO skill or talent.

- In some fields, like financial markets, success is primarily due to luck. One study found no correlation between the performance rankings of investment advisers over multiple years. Their success in any given year seemed random.

- We have a "feature-positive" effect — we notice and emphasize what is present rather than what is absent. This makes us overlook risks and issues not on our "checklist." 

- For example, auditors may miss types of fraud not on their checklist. Mortgage lenders may overlook risks not directly related to a borrower's income. We promote the benefits of a product but downplay the risks.

- Academics and journals tend to prize hypotheses proven true rather than those disproven. We prefer positive advice over negative warnings, even if the harmful advice is valuable.

- We struggle to perceive "non-events" and appreciate the absence of nasty things. We appreciate being healthy once we are sick or in the absence of war during peacetime. We should train ourselves to think more about what is missing to be happier and make better judgments.

- Organizations often "cherry-pick" data, highlighting successes and hiding failures or shortcomings. Hotel websites show only the best photos. CEOs emphasize team triumphs but downplay challenges in presentations. Anecdotes should be given more weight with scrutiny. We should be wary of information that seems "too good to be true."

That covers the key highlights and main takeaways from the passage on luck versus skill, the feature-positive effect, and the human tendency toward cherry-picking data. Please let me know if you want me to clarify or expand on any summary part.

 

The more specialized a field is, the more susceptible it is to cherry-picking—highlighting only successes and ignoring failures or missed targets. Academia, medicine, and business are prone to this. We should be skeptical of their claims and ask about failed projects or unmet goals.

There is no single cause for complex events. Trying to pin the blame on just one factor is a fallacy. Multiple influences interact to shape outcomes. To understand the failure of a new product, for example, we must consider many possibilities, not just one. 

The intention-to-treat error occurs when subjects drop out of a study for reasons related to the outcome, skewing the results. For example, speeding drivers may appear safer because reckless drivers who crash drop out of the sample. Companies with debt may seem more profitable because struggling debt-free firms go bankrupt and leave the study. A drug may seem adequate because sicker patients discontinue it, leaving healthier patients in the trial. We must check if subjects vanished from a study and account for the implications.

The hunt for a scapegoat is an ancient instinct but relies on the fallacy of a single cause. Outcomes depend on countless factors, though we prefer to blame individuals. The notion of free will is questionable; circumstances beyond our control shape us. Holding people solely responsible for events is unjust and allows the powerful to absolve themselves of blame.


 

The author argues that consuming news is mainly useless and even harmful.   He shares three main reasons to avoid news:

1.   Our brains are disproportionately drawn to certain types of sensational news distorting our worldview.   We end up with a "mental map of the risks and threats we face."

2.   News is irrelevant.   Out of the thousands of news stories we consume yearly, very few help us make better decisions or improve our lives.   News promises a "competitive advantage" but provides a "competitive disadvantage." 

3.   News could be a better use of time.   The amount of time the average person spends consuming news amounts to a massive loss in productivity.   For example, the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks resulted in people wasting over 2,000 lives' worth of time following the news updates. 

The author recommends eliminating news consumption and reading long-form articles and books to understand the world better.   He argues for a "via negativa" approach - eliminating errors and flawed thinking rather than focusing on positives.   By removing "everything that is not David," as Michelangelo put it, success will follow.

While emotions and irrational urges have long been blamed for poor thinking and judgment, the "cold" theory of irrationality suggests that thinking is prone to predictable errors and traps, even for knowledgeable people.   These cognitive errors originate from the fact that human thinking evolved for a much simpler environment than the complex world we live in today.   We can improve our thinking and decision-making by recognizing and correcting these predictable errors and biases.   However, we will never eliminate them.

 

In the past 10,000 years, human society and the world have transformed dramatically.   Since the Industrial Revolution, little resembles the environment humans evolved in.   Our ancestral environment rewarded quick reactions and snap decisions.   Now, more contemplation and independent thinking are advantageous.

There are three explanations for persistent human errors and biases:

1.   Evolutionary psychology: Our brains evolved for a hunter-gatherer existencould be better and perfectly optimized for today's world.   Evolution only eliminates seriously detrimental errors, not all errors. 

2.   Our brains evolved to persuade, not seek the truth.   Convincing others gave reproductive advantages.   Truth-seeking is secondary.

3.   Intuitive thinking, though flawed, works well for many decisions.   Rational thinking is slow, demanding, and consumes mental resources.   For unimportant choices, intuition suffices.   For significant, high-consequence choices, rational analysis is best.

No one lives an error-free life.   The key is using intuition and rationality appropriately:

•For essential decisions with significant consequences, think rationally and systematically check for errors. 

•For unimportant choices, rely on intuition.   The costs of errors are low. 

•In your "circle of competence," where you have expertise, intuition can work well.   However, for essential decisions beyond your expertise, use rational thinking.

•Find your actual circle of competence.   It is smaller than you likely think.

Though knowledge of cognitive biases can help reduce errors, anticipating and avoiding all errors requires too much effort for most daily living.   For many choices, "good enough" decisions suffice.   However, apply rigorous thinking for consequential choices, especially those beyond your circle of competence.

The book draws on cognitive and social psychology research over the past few decades.   The references and sources should be more numerous to list comprehensively.

 

Studies involving comparisons between Harvard graduates and those admitted but attended elsewhere are problematic due to small sample sizes. 

Happiness is mainly due to chance and circumstances outside our control.

Organizations often recruit individuals who already share the values of the organization.   The organization then enhances those values through training.

The clustering illusion is the tendency to perceive patterns in random or meaningless data.   People are prone to seeing faces, images of religious figures, or objects in random shapes, sequences of numbers, or events.   The brain is geared to detect patterns, even where none exist.

Social proof refers to people's tendency to look to the actions of others to determine their own.   People assume the actions of others reflect the correct behavior for a given situation.   Examples include laughter tracks making jokes seem funnier and the enthusiasm of crowds.

The sunk cost fallacy is the tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, time, or effort has been made.   Even when the activity is irrational or there are better alternatives, people remain committed to see it through.   Many see it as "wasting" the initial investment.   In reality, that cost is gone regardless of future actions. 

The rule of reciprocity refers to the tendency to repay, in kind, what another person has provided.   Reciprocity creates a sense of obligation and politicians and businesses frequently take advantage of this tendency to gain cooperation or sales.
 
Confirmation bias refers to seeking information confirming one's preexisting beliefs while ignoring information contradicting them.   People accumulate ideas and beliefs that remain primarily unquestioned and resist change despite contradictory evidence.

Authority bias is the tendency to value and accept information and opinions from those in positions of authority.   What authorities say is often accepted without critical evaluation.   This can lead to poor decision making and "groupthink."

The contrast effect refers to the tendency for things and perceptions to be influenced compared to things recently experienced.   When exposed to a series of options, choices tend to be based more on comparison to previous options rather than objective assessments.   Our judgments of experiences are highly relative.

 Here is a summary of the contrast effect and related biases:

The contrast effect refers to how our judgment can be affected by contrasting it with something else.   People tend to make assessments relative to the situation rather than in absolute terms.   For example, a building may seem exceptionally tall when we compare it to surrounding buildings, but not when we compare it to skyscrapers. 

The availability bias leads us to judge the probability or frequency of an event based on how easily examples come to mind.   Vivid, emotionally charged or recent events are most available to our memory, distorting our judgment.   For example, we may overestimate the risk of death from a terrorist attack or shark attack due to heavy media coverage, while underestimating less publicized risks like medical errors or climate change.

The "it'll-get-worse-before-it-gets-better" fallacy refers to the mistaken belief that a bad situation must continue to worsen before improving, rather than turning around at any point.   This fallacy can lead to poor decisions by inducing a kind of paralysis.

Story bias refers to our tendency to misjudge the likelihood of an event when we are exposed to a compelling story or plot about it.   Stories grip our attention and emotions in a way that a mere statement of probability cannot.   While stories have benefits, they can also lead to poor risk assessment and decision making.

The hindsight bias refers to our tendency to see events that had already occurred as more predictable or likely than they were before they took place.   Once we know the outcome, we trick ourselves into thinking we knew it all along.   This bias can lead to poor judgment about past events' predictability and future events' unpredictability. 

The overconfidence effect refers to our tendency to be more confident in our knowledge, abilities, and judgment than objectively warranted.   While some confidence is valuable and necessary, more confidence is needed with evidence or skill to avoid costly mistakes and poor decisions.   Overconfidence afflicts men in particular, possibly due to evolutionary advantages.   However, it also contributes to the relationship between doctors and patients, where an appearance of confidence can be reassuring.

"Chauffeur knowledge" refers to knowledge we possess but do not fully understand or know how to apply.   Like a chauffeur who knows how to operate a complex vehicle but does not understand its mechanical workings, we can know much about a topic or discipline without grasping it deeply enough to make sound judgments.   Sticking within our "circle of competence" requires knowing where the perimeter of our knowledge lies.

 

- People have limited competence areas, and expanding those areas takes much work.   You need to determine your aptitudes and play to your strengths.

- The illusion of control refers to people's tendency to overestimate their ability to influence events.   For example, people feel more in control when rolling dice in casinos.   This illusion persists even when people logically know an event is entirely random. 

- The incentive super-response tendency refers to the human tendency to respond strongly to incentives.   This can lead to unintended consequences as people focus on the incentives and lose sight of the bigger picture.   Clear incentives are essential but must be designed carefully.

- Regression to the mean is a statistical phenomenon that can appear like a causal relationship.   For example, praising someone for an excellent performance may be followed by a worse performance, not because the praise caused a worse performance but because extreme performances tend to be followed by more average ones.

- The outcome bias refers to evaluating a decision based on its outcome rather than on the quality of the decision making.   However, good decisions can have bad outcomes due to randomness and vice versa.   We must evaluate decisions based on the knowledge available at the time.

- The paradox of choice refers to the fact that while people like having choices, too many can be paralyzing and lead to less satisfaction.   This can apply to both trivial choices and life-changing ones.   Some degree of constraints and limited choices is helpful.

- The liking bias refers to the human tendency to be influenced by how much we like someone.   We are more easily persuaded and tend to agree with people we like.   Likability is a shortcut that often has little to do with the merits of an argument. 

- The endowment effect refers to the tendency of people to value things more simply because they own them.   This means they will demand a higher price to part with an item than they would be willing to pay to acquire it.   Ownership has a significant psychological impact on value.

 

The story discusses the probability that all 15 church choir members arrived late for practice due to circumstances outside of their control, causing them to avoid dying in the explosion.   It is highly improbable statistically but possible due to the correlation between individuals.   Groupthink occurs when people interact, unlike swarm intelligence where people act independently. 

People neglect probability and have no intuitive sense of risk.   Volatility does not equal risk.   Technologies with emotionally powerful potential outcomes attract interest regardless of risk.   People are sensitive to certainty but not mid-range probabilities.   The Delaney Clause banned synthetic carcinogens due to neglect of probabilities.

The scarcity error causes people to desire items more when they are scarce or eliminated.   In an experiment, ratings of cookies increased when the number available decreased.   People wanted posters more when one was eliminated as a choice.   This is "reactance," resisting loss of freedom or choice.

Base-rate neglect ignores background probabilities in favor of distinctive information.   Hearing hoofbeats, people think "zebra" not "horse." A Mozart fan is likelier to be a musician or German speaker, not necessarily a Mozart imitator.   In blind wine tasting, people described ordinary wine in mysterious terms.   Diagnosing rare diseases, doctors neglect base rates.

The gambler's fallacy wrongly assumes that odds change based on past events.   People expect "tails" after a streak of "heads" when flipping a fair coin.   A casino detected biased roulette wheels from people misperceiving randomness.   IQ test scores of two groups were seen as converging when random.   Loaded dice were seen as becoming fair after streaks. 

Anchoring causes estimates to stay close to initial values.   Asking people for social security numbers caused auction bids and price estimates to reflect those numbers.   The anchor could be absurd, as in estimating the year Lincoln was born.   An Attila the Hun anecdote showed the arbitrary nature of anchors.   Anchors influence real estate pricing, negotiation, and sales.   Adjustments from anchors often need to be improved.   Anchoring is a significant source of error in judgment and decision making.

 

- Anchoring effect: We are influenced by initial values when making estimates.   People request extraordinarily remarkable damages in lawsuits based on anchoring.

- Induction problem: We are still determining if the future will resemble the past.   Each induction is uncertain.   Even with many observations, we need to find out if things are causally linked.   David Hume and Karl Popper discussed these issues.

- Loss aversion: We feel losses more strongly than gains.   Prospect Theory by Kahneman and Tversky showed this.   A breast cancer study showed loss-framed messages were more effective.   However, some studies can show more than precise results.   We react more strongly to adverse events.   Even monkeys show loss aversion.

- Social loafing: People exert less effort in groups.   Kravitz and Martin reviewed the Ringelmann effect.   Latane, Williams and Harkins studied social loafing.   Risky shift shows groups take more risks. 

- Exponential growth: A quantity growing by a fixed percent per unit of time.   70% growth means doubling in the period.   Natural logarithms determine the period.   Population growth was discussed in The Limits to Growth.   We still need raw material shortages. 

- Winner's curse: Winning bidders often need to pay more.   Thaler described this.   Competitive arousal makes people want to win.   Publishers overpay for books.   Buffett avoids open-outcry auctions.   Mergers and acquisitions often destroy value.

- Fundamental attribution error: We overattribute behavior to people's dispositions, not the situation.   Ross described this.   A speech experiment showed this.   Buffett said good business people choose good businesses. 

- False causality: We often confuse correlation with causation.   Examples show correlation of storks and births, and books in homes and high test scores.  

- Halo effect: We perceive unattended/irrelevant details because of a positive impression. Thorndike defined it. Nisbett and Wilson studied it.   Rosenzweig discussed it in business. 

- Alternative paths: Small, unpredictable events can lead to vastly different outcomes.   Taleb discussed this using Russian roulette and historical figures.   He argued that extreme investment returns mean high uncertainty.  

- Forecast illusion: Experts are often poor forecasters and overconfident in their predictions.   Tetlock studied this.   Experts make vague, extreme predictions and do not refrain from revising them in the face of contrary evidence.   They succumb to confirmation bias.   Simple models often do better than experts.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the provided sources regarding expert judgment and forecasting:

- Experts are prone to the same biases and heuristics as laypeople.   Their judgments often need to be more confident and precise. 
- Economic and market forecasts could be better and more consistent.   If experts could forecast accurately, they would all be wealthy. 
- Predictions often fail because they need to account for unforeseen events.   Plagues and wars often surprise experts and forecasters.
- Analysts frequently downgrade stocks after the fact, showing their inability to predict in advance.   Their forecasts are often retrospective.
- Projections and forecasts create an illusion of precision but have little usefulness.   It is best to ignore them. 
- Both professional investors and laypeople performed worse than chance when trying to pick stocks that would outperform.   However, both needed to be more confident in their abilities.
- The conjunction fallacy leads people to believe more specific scenarios are more likely than general ones, even when the inverse is true.   The availability heuristic drives this fallacy.  
- The framing of choices and options influences decisions.   How something is presented affects our preferences and judgments. 
- Action bias leads to a tendency to take action for action's sake to avoid regret or the appearance of lacking control.   It results in foolish decisions and unnecessary activity. 
- The omission bias leads people to prefer inactions that lead to harm (omissions) over actions that lead to equivalent or lesser harm.   Inactions seem less unethical, even when they are not.

The sources show the many judgmental biases, heuristics, and tendencies that undermine expert forecasts, predictions, and decision making.   Reliance on intuition, overprecision, overconfidence, and logical fallacies frequently lead experts astray.

 In summary, whether an act is one of omission or commission does matter in terms of how people perceive and judge the act.   Generally, people weigh acts of commission, in which something is actively done, more heavily than acts of omission, in which something is passively not done.   This is known as the omission bias.   For example, people tend to judge failing to vaccinate a child against a disease more leniently than actively refusing to vaccinate.   The omission bias leads people to prefer the default or status quo over actively choosing an alternative.

Several factors contribute to the omission bias.   First, acts of omission seem less causal and intentional than acts of commission.   Omissions also often seem less abnormal or deviant than commissions.   In addition, the consequences of omissions are often less obvious or salient than the consequences of commissions, even if they are equally harmful.   The omission bias has important implications for decision making in domains like medical care, public policy, and the law.   Awareness of this bias can help combat its potentially harmful effects.

So in short, yes it does matter whether an act is a commission or omission.   The omission bias and related phenomena like the status quo bias can subtly but powerfully influence judgment and decision making.   Recognizing these effects is essential to overcoming them when possible and creating better outcomes.

 

These win out." In the short term, impulses and emotions tend to dominate decision making.   Over longer time horizons, however, reason and calculation prevail. 

The "because" justification works for small requests but not high-stakes decisions.   People consider arguments carefully when a lot is at stake.

Decision fatigue sets in after making many choices, depleting self-control and leading to poor decisions or delays.   It affects everyone, from CEOs to judges.   Rest and avoiding decisions can help regain willpower.

The contagion bias leads us to believe that "once in contact, always in contact." We irrationally fear contamination via distant or implausible connections.   Photographs or locations of disliked public figures can trigger this bias. 

Averages mask meaningful differences and lead to poor predictions or decisions.   Not all parts of a distribution are the same. What is typical may mislead.

Motivation crowding: External rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation for interesting tasks.   Paying people to do what they enjoy naturally can backfire and reduce motivation.   Non-monetary incentives work better. 

The twaddle tendency refers to unintelligible writing that appears meaningful.   Unclear thoughts expressed in convoluted prose create an illusion of profundity.   Simplicity and clarity are better.

The Will Rogers phenomenon occurs when new diagnostic techniques or categories change survival statistics in misleading ways.   Rearranging or reclassifying patients to different stages of a disease can make treatment seem more effective than it is.

 

Information bias: More information can lead to better decisions.   People tend to seek more and more information to gain certainty.   However, extra information only sometimes leads to better judgments.  

Effort justification: People tend to value things more when they have put effort into attaining them, even if the effort resulted in a poor outcome.   This is to avoid cognitive dissonance. 

Law of small numbers: People tend to draw conclusions based on small sample sizes, assuming the sample is representative of the whole.   However, small samples often lead to false conclusions.  

Expectations: Our expectations influence our perceptions and judgments.   We see what we expect to see and believe what we expect to believe.   Expectations also influence outcomes through the Pygmalion or self-fulfilling prophecy effect.

Simple logic: Our thinking is often simpler than we realize.   We make logical errors that we do not perceive.   Tests of cognitive reflection like the CRT can reveal the simplicity of our thinking.

Forer effect: People tend to accept vague personality descriptions as uniquely applicable to them.   We see what we want to see in these descriptions and ignore information that does not fit.   This is due to the Barnum effect.  

Volunteer's folly: Volunteering for a job often seems appealing, but the costs and difficulties should be considered.   It is usually more efficient to hire an expert or professional.   This is an example of the law of comparative advantage.  

Affect heuristic: Our emotions and moods influence our judgments and decision making.   We tend to rely on emotions over logic when making judgments under uncertainty.  

Introspection illusion: We believe we have a deeper understanding of our minds and motivations than we do.   Our introspections feel comprehensive but are often superficial.   We cannot see the cognitive and motivational processes operating behind the scenes.   

Inability to close doors: We keep options open even when it is beneficial to commit to a path.   This prevents us from achieving closure and can reduce satisfaction and happiness. 

Neomania: We tend to be overly excited by new things, believing new is always better.   However, innovations are only sometimes superior to the tried and true.   New is only sometimes improved.

Sleeper effect: Information we learn but then discount or ignore can still influence our opinions and beliefs.   This is because we only partially discount information even when we think we have rejected it.   It continues to shape our thinking in subtle ways. 

Social comparison bias: We tend to make faulty comparisons between ourselves and others.   We often compare our behind-the-scenes selves with the public image of others.   This makes us feel inferior when we are not.   We would be better served comparing ourselves to our former selves.  

Primacy and recency effects: Information that comes first (primacy) and last (recency) tends to be better remembered and substantially influences judgments.   Information in the middle is more easily forgotten.   These effects impact persuasion and decision making.

Not-invented-here syndrome: We ignore or discount information, input, solutions, and new ideas from external sources.   There is a preference for information that arises internally.   This limits our learning and growth.

Black Swan: Highly improbable but impactful events that we do not or cannot predict.   Their unforeseeability and consequences mean they shape history in ways we can only see retrospectively.   We tend to ignore the possibility of black swans due to narrative fallacies and the bell curve.  

Domain dependence: Our thinking and judgments are highly dependent on context.   We must account for this dependence and assume we are consistent and objective across situations.   In reality, context profoundly impacts reasoning and choice in ways we fail to perceive.

 

- Domestic violence is more common among police families than the general population. 
- The Markowitz example shows minimizing future regret by diversifying investments.
- Domain specificity: Being skilled in one area (piano) does not mean equal skill in another (football). 
- The false consensus effect makes people overestimate how much others agree with them. 
- The sandwich board study showed people overestimate support for their position. 
- The false consensus effect stems from availability bias and self-serving bias.   It can be reduced by presenting opposing views.
- People distort memories and facts to fit their preexisting beliefs (falsification of history).
- In-group out-group bias: people favor their group over others.   This starts early and promotes "pseudo kinship."
- Ambiguity aversion: People prefer known risks over unknown uncertainties.   This relates to Knightian uncertainty and the Ellsberg paradox. 
- The default effect: people stick with pre-set options.   This is used in policy and product design.   Defaults can be hard to change due to ambiguity aversion and status quo bias.
- Fear of regret leads to risk avoidance and rationalizing previous choices.   It influences gambling, stock trading, and reactions to missed opportunities.  
- The salience effect: People focus on prominent, vivid details, often missing more relevant factors.   This relates to availability bias. 
- The house-money effect: People take more risks with windfall money than they have earned.   This relates to mental accounting.
- Procrastination occurs despite intentions, leading to missed deadlines and opportunities.   Precommitment can help overcome it.  
- Envy is a negative emotion related to social comparison.   It can motivate competitive behavior but also lead to harming others.

 Here is a summary of the fairy tale "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves":

Snow White's stepmother was jealous of Snow White's beauty.   First, the stepmother hired an assassin to kill Snow White, but he did not do so.   Snow White fled into the forest, where she came upon the house of the seven dwarfs.   The stepmother's attempt to outsource the job failed, so she decided to poison Snow White herself.   She disguised herself as an older woman and gave Snow White a poisoned apple.   Snow White ate the apple and fell into a deep slumber.   The dwarfs, with the help of a prince, were able to revive Snow White, and she lived happily ever after.

The critical elements of the story are:

1.   Snow White's stepmother is jealous of Snow White's beauty. 
2.   The stepmother first hires an assassin to kill Snow White, but he does not do so.
3.   Snow White finds refuge with the seven dwarfs in their house in the forest.
4.   The stepmother poisons Snow White with a poisoned apple in disguise. 
5.   Snow White falls into a deep slumber after eating the poisoned apple.
6.   The dwarfs and a prince revive Snow White.
7.   Snow White lives happily ever after.

The central theme of the story is that good triumphs over evil.   Despite the stepmother's jealousy and attempts to get rid of Snow White, Snow White prevails in the end with the help of the dwarfs and the prince.

 

- The essay "Nexus Causality, Moral Warfare, and Misattribution Arbitrage" by John Tooby argue against the fallacy of single-cause explanations. 

- The intention-to-treat error, also known as the intent-to-treat principle, occurs when researchers analyze study participants in the group they were randomly assigned to, even if they did not fully participate in that group.   This can lead to underestimating the effectiveness of treatment.

- The epilogue highlights Charlie Munger's approach of "via negativa," which focuses first on avoiding mistakes and folly before considering affirmative steps.   Part of having "uncommon sense" is ignoring foolish ideas.

- The book was written by Rolf Dobelli, a Swiss novelist and entrepreneur.   He founded getAbstract, a resource for compressed business book summaries.
