 

The author grew up in the Philippines in a family with supernatural and spiritual beliefs. Though Catholic, they engaged in practices like spirit communication and healing. The author showed signs of psychic abilities from childhood that made her feel like an outcast. 

At 18, the author's family moved to the U.S. She struggled to adapt and earn money. She studied self-help books to improve her situation but still felt stuck and unhappy.

On a friend's recommendation, the author saw a psychic and energy healer. The healer said "energy blocks" were preventing her progress and happiness. Though skeptical, she felt calm after a session. A month later, she was offered an unexpected opportunity that earned her a year's salary in a day. She attributed this to the healing.

The author traveled to Sedona, Arizona, a spiritual place, and had a profound experience releasing childhood pain and seeing visions. This "opened her third eye." She started receiving spiritual messages and doing her own energy healing. She found she could sense information about others and help them. 

The author studied various healing techniques and helped over 10,000 people through free sessions. The sessions could be intense but also led to improved well-being. Her healing ability also activated gifts in her sisters.

After her first marriage ended, the author went to Sedona again and released trapped emotions from her past. Soon after, she met her current wife who inspired her to strengthen her channeling and start practicing physical healing.

The author believes energy detoxes clear blocks preventing you from accessing your gifts and purpose. Blocks are like obstructions slowing energy flow. Detoxing reveals your gifts, prevents negativity, and allows you to help others. Everyone has unique gifts to benefit humanity.

Energy influences your life. High vibration feels good, low vibration feels bad. Others' energies and environments affect you. Clearing your energy prevents this and keeps your vibration high.

Blocks form from low vibration and negativity, impeding progress. They start in your aura, then enter chakras and body. God determines how fast they clear. After clearing, you feel better and experience miracles. The goal is clear energy, high vibration, authenticity, and purpose.

There are three types of blocks:

1. Traumatic: From past pain, causing negative patterns. 
2. Environmental: Absorbed from surroundings, causing sudden emotions. Clearing helps all.
3. Familial: Inherited beliefs and behaviors from family, tied to shared energy field.

 

• Energy blocks are negative influences that weigh you down. They include traumatic, environmental and familial blocks passed through generations. Releasing them allows you to reach your potential.

• Internal and external influences feed energy blocks. Internal influences come from within and include thoughts, beliefs and experiences. External influences come from outside and include environment, relationships and societal pressures. Reducing exposure and maintaining boundaries help minimize impact.

• Becoming aware of what builds your blocks is key to releasing them. Energy and emotional work lift you into higher frequencies to release blocks. There are three block categories: traumatic, environmental and familial (generational and gestational).

• Detoxing releases blocks, opens spiritual gifts and life purpose. Gifts emerge around day 5-7 of a detox. You may feel heightened senses, heat in hands (if a healer), anxiety or vivid dreams. Gifts were always part of you but dormant. Without detoxing, gifts decrease, become blocked or disappear if ego gets involved. 

• Unexpected rewards of detoxing include intuition, guidance, ease in decisions and accessing higher realities. Small life changes show you're on the right path. Gifts enhance life.

• Protection techniques in the first 3 days include intention, sacred geometry and color therapy. They protect from negative energy and influence. Trying combinations helps determine what works for your needs. Protection maintains balance and well-being.

• Creating a shield involves intention, visualizing sacred geometry and surrounding in protective color. This protects from external energies. Finding the right combination is personal and intuitive. You may experience side effects as energy moves. Shields provide freedom and control over energy. The universe will reshape life around new energy.

• Energy clearing removes negative energy attached to you. Focus on auric field and chakras. Do clearings morning and night, and impromptu when needed. Clearing has 3 steps: clear auric field and chakras, invite authentic energy in. After clearing, feel peace, confidence and relaxation. Clearing creates space for good. Extend clearing up to 3 days. Stay happy and calm to aid clearing.

• Imagination is important for energy work. It taps into spiritual reality and produces miracles. Exercising imagination strengthens divine connection. To clear chakras, rub hands, move over chakras noticing intensity (blocks). Use colors, geometry and intention to clear each chakra.

 Here is a summary of the key points from highest vibration to lowest:

• Connecting with your higher self through meditation is one of the highest ways to raise your vibration. Visualizing divine light filling you and following it up to connect with God/Source energy helps you tap into your higher wisdom and insight. Ask your higher self for guidance on any area of your life.

•Unconditional love and gratitude are the two emotional states that vibrate the highest. Cultivate them through daily practices like journaling, affirmations and acts of kindness. They open you up to infinite possibilities and help prevent fear.

•Doing uplifting activities that align with your natural talents, passions and wiring raise your vibration in an authentic way. Options include time in nature, art, music, creativity, service to others, solitude. Do them with the intention of raising your vibration and follow your intuition.

•Using light, color and crystal therapy are effective ways to raise your vibration. Visualize divine light filling and lifting you up. Work with crystals like citrine, selenite, amethyst and rose quartz. Place them around your space or wear them.

•Your environment and relationships shift to match your vibration. As it rises, you'll attract passion projects, like-minded people and feel comfortable being fully self-expressed. You'll feel at home in yourself and the world. Hosting events becomes easy.

•Grounding techniques like visualizing roots growing from your feet into the earth help stabilize your energy and prevent feelings of anxiety, inadequacy or being ungrounded. They balance a high vibration.

•Your vibration fluctuates naturally based on your emotional state and experiences. Respond to challenges with love, listening and boundaries. Give yourself grace when overcorrecting. Do uplifting activities to raise it again.

•Signs your vibration is lowering include negative emotions, attracting draining people and problems arising. Determine the underlying cause and make adjustments to raise your vibration again through clearing work, boundaries, uplifting activities, etc.

•Comparing how you feel now versus before you began the work can show you how much progress you've made in raising your vibration. Ask others if they've noticed positive changes in you. Journal your experiences and reflections on the journey.

Psychics tap into intuitive knowledge and may receive prophetic information. They need self-care to stay balanced.

Readers tend to be analytical, curious knowledge-seekers. They provide guidance on life lessons and purpose, not day-to-day matters. The info taps into higher truth. Readers use the records to create healing products and services. Signs of a reader include “just knowing” things, loving learning and being good at trivia.

- Weather/electronics gift is rare, affecting 5-7%. Signs: weather changes with mood, electronics malfunction in presence, life shifts with tech issues. Determine your gift through breathing, intention, visualization, building energy and feeling the most magnetic choice. Guidance comes. Using gifts again after detox can feel uncomfortable.

1. Purpose work involves using your spiritual gifts to serve others in a meaningful way. It should fulfill you and help elevate your energy and life.

2. As you practice your purpose, relationships and situations that don’t match your vibration will fade away. This helps align your life to your gifts.
