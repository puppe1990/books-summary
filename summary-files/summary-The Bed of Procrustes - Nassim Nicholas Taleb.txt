 Here is a summary:

The summaries express several thoughts rediscovered throughout history, as Montaigne demonstrated. Some key ideas:

- People often argue without realizing the true subject of disagreement. 
- Unsuccessful people often give the most advice.
- Rumors are only valuable when denied. 
- We are more prone to deceiving ourselves than others.
- There are those who try to win arguments and those who try to find truth. They differ.
- People often apologize to repeat their actions.
- Mathematics replaces knowledge like an artificial hand replaces a real one.
- We now need reasons to justify natural acts like walking. This reflects hidden anxieties.
- Social media is antisocial. Knowledge workers are ignorant. The social sciences are unscientific. 
- We should look for people's "cause of life" not just their "cause of death."
- Those who use others most hate being used themselves.
- Be skeptical of those with many reasons for wanting a job. 
- Someone who shares secrets but expects you to keep them cannot keep secrets themselves.
- Social networks would be more informative if they described what people dislike, not just like.
- Asking "why" makes reticent people talkative due to over-attributing causation.
- Truly independent thinkers may seem dull, like accountants.

The summaries continue with many other thoughts on subjects like:

- The dangers of addictions to things like technology, carbohydrates, and a regular salary.  
- How to live an authentic "paleo life" free of overwork and over-schedule. 
- How skills like spontaneity and broad knowledge transfer between domains but narrow expertise and "efficiency" do not.
- How most efficiencies ultimately punish us.
- The differences between real, social life and modern life. 
- Various critiques of technology, competition, treadmills, and more.
- Insights into writing, literature, reading, philosophy, and related domains.

In all, the summaries express a wide range of thought-provoking ideas that question many assumptions of modern life. The thoughts praise independence, spontaneity, social connection, and depth while critiquing narrowness, overwork, technology, and more.

 Here is a summary:

- Regular minds find similarities; finer minds detect differences. 
- We amplify commonalities with friends and differences with strangers.
- Many  study history to repeat mistakes.
-There is nothing  harmful that can't benefit in some instances. Complex systems weaken universal notions.
- The fool generalizes the particular; the nerd particularizes the general. 
- You want to be  unique; the collective wants you generic.
- Love is the victory of the particular over the general.

- We have little control over our thoughts. 
- Wisdom degrades over time. 
- Replace illusions with other illusions. 
- Much seeming random is in our control. 
- The fool sees himself as more unique and others more generic. The wise sees himself as more generic and others more unique.
- Medicine fooled people because it displayed successes and buried mistakes.
- Focus on what others don't know, not what you know.
- Medieval man didn't understand his world; modern man thinks he understands his complicated world.
- Data toxicity increases faster than benefits.

- Most accept art when others say it's good; some need two or more to say so. 
- Almutanabbi boasted of being the greatest poet in the greatest poem. 
- Wit shows intelligence without nerdiness.
- Classical art showed lean males and plump females; modern art shows the opposite.
- No academic matches creators.
- Explaining poetry annoys poets.

- True friends have no reasons for their friendship.  
- Life's beauty: kind acts from those wanting no reciprocation. 
- We help those who need it least.
- Value people by how they change from first to last encounter.
- Meditation satisfies narcissism without harm.
- True humility surprises yourself more than others.  
- National pride is boasting. 
- Convince only those who benefit.  
- Greatness begins by replacing hatred with disdain.
- Trust those who stand or lie down more than those who sit.
- Obvious virtues are hardest to achieve.  
- The miserly are generous with advice.
- If you lie to me, keep lying.  
- Don't trust those needing income, except minimum wage.
- You may outlive strength, never wisdom.
- Weak men satisfy needs, strong men duties.
- Religion evolved from promising heaven for good deeds to promising heaven during good deeds to demanding good deeds.
- Heroes have choice; avoid calling others heroes. 
- Some thank for what you gave; others blame for what you didn't give.
- Ethical people match beliefs to profession, not vice versa. Now rare.

- Promising luck for good deeds seems like a bribe. 
- Magnificence v. arrogance lies in private acts.
- Nations are apartheid without political incorrectness.
- In crowds, 50% of wealth, 90% of imagination, and 100% of courage reside in 1 person—not the same one.
- Hiding weaknesses makes them repugnant. 
- In English, no distinction between irreverent-up  and irreverent-down.  
- One poor ex-social equal affects more than many starving foreigners.

- Secure people can lose fortune without humility.
- Test robustness to reputation by claiming someone is "still doing poorly."
- Robustness is progress without impatience.  
- Conflicted between choices? Take neither.  
- Nations like war; city-states like commerce; families like stability; individuals like entertainment.
- Robust care about few who like their work; fragile care about few who don't.  
- The rationalist wants an imbecile-free world; the empiricist wants an imbecile-proof one—or a rationalist-proof one.
- Academics are useful when useless (math, philosophy) but dangerous when useful.  
- For the robust, errors inform; for the fragile, errors are errors.  
- Test reputational robustness by emotional reaction to a journalist's email.   
- The disadvantage of being a writer, especially in Britain, is nothing damages your reputation.  
- Passionate hate ends by rotating to new hates; the mediocre have only one enemy. Warring statelets are robust.  

 Here is a summary:

- The author dislikes big government but favors big business. Deficits tend to be larger than planned. 

- Sports and competitions fossilize the mind and body. Classroom training only improves classroom skills.

- The businessman carried light luggage but lifted heavy weights. Games give nonheroes the illusion of winning. IQ and SAT tests are designed so nerds can score high.

- Knowledge is subtractive. Intelligence is ignoring irrelevant things. Happiness is avoiding unhappiness. The genius has more imagination than intellect; the academic has more intellect than imagination.

- The most influential moderns (Darwin, Marx, Freud, Einstein) were scholars, not academics. Philosophers gain insight through leisure. Accepting incompleteness requires intellect and confidence. 

- Economics and consultants are vulgar. What they call “risk” is opportunity; “low risk” opportunity is a sucker problem. Models and markets are stupid. Curing greed with money is foolish. Institutions lack individual virtues. Incompetence causes progress; competence causes fragility. Scamming billions is easier than scamming millions.

- The failure of “scientific approximation” comes from the fact that the average of expectations differs from the expectation of averages. Summarizing "you need skills to get a BMW, skills plus luck to become Warren Buffett" as "Taleb says Buffett has no skills" is poor journalism.  

The key ideas are that randomness, unpredictability, and limited knowledge pervade life. Understanding incompleteness and avoiding overconfidence is necessary for progress. Institutionalization and overreliance on models and metrics can increase fragility. Vulgarity and incompetence are more problematic than commonly realized.

 Here is a summary:

- The author discusses how people's areas of expertise and preferences often determine their career choices. Those interested in science pursue science careers; those talented in the arts pursue arts careers; the practical pursue business; and those left over become economists.  

- Companies and economies are prone to collapse (like cells undergoing apoptosis or programmed cell death) due to accumulating hidden risks and debt. Government bailouts only make this cycle of boom and bust more drawn out.

- In poor countries, officials openly take bribes while in wealthy nations like the US, officials are implicitly influenced through the "revolving door" between government and private corporations.

- It is ironic and cruel when a banker ends up in poverty. The author suggests re-evaluating students' GPAs by counting finance and economics grades in reverse.

- Agency problems drive companies to take on more and more risk until they become very fragile. 

- In politics, we must choose between warmongers who support big business and nation-states, or technocrats who serve large employers but are detached from reality and prone to top-down control. However, we have a choice to reject both.

- Most people avoid criticizing small insults but remain passive towards large injustices (like major corporate or political malfeasance). Only the "magnificent" (or morally courageous) criticize injustice at any scale.  

- The implicit and the unsaid often reveal more than what is explicit or openly stated. People's interests and silences can be more revealing than their dating profiles or public declarations. 

- There are many kinds of love, but rarely do people thirst for money, knowledge, and love all at once. Love often requires sacrifice. Marriage tends to make both men and women more alike or "feminized." 

- The author distrusts declared endings or the idea that life has a fixed conclusion and believes events rarely terminate in the clear-cut way most films do. Our knowledge has limitations, and we often impose inaccurate or "Procrustean" narratives on complex realities that do not fit neatly into simplistic categories. The modern world bombards us with information, fueling more delusion. We must remain robust to uncertainties and unknowns, not fragile.

 Here is a summary:

- The author likes aphorisms, maxims and proverbs because they are short but poignant. They have been used for many purposes over time, from religious texts to poetry to philosophy. 
- Good aphorisms are thought-provoking and require reflection. The author believes his writing style tends towards the aphoristic. His ideas often come to him spontaneously while walking or relaxing. 
- The author criticizes the 'nerdification' of society and scorn for the abstract. He believes this makes us vulnerable to 'Black Swan' events. Science is not good at dealing with complex, interdependent systems. 
- The author values erudition, elegance and courage over phoniness, nerdiness and philistinism. He believes art and aphorisms make life worth living.
- Although the author's ideas are often reduced to an opposition to technology, his main concern is naivety about its unintended effects and fragility. He believes ethics should be unconditional but technology conditional.
- The author acknowledges many people who have helped and influenced him. He describes himself as spending most of his time meditating in cafes.

The key ideas are a defense of aphoristic philosophy and poetry, a critique of blind faith in science and technology, the importance of robustness and concern for 'Black Swan' events, and the influence of various thinkers on the author's meditative style of work.
