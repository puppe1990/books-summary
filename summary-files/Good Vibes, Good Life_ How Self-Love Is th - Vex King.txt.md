The author wants to share lessons he is learned to help readers live a "greater life" - becoming the best version of themselves and achieving their full potential. He says every person can make a positive difference in the world. Living a more extraordinary life means breaking free of limits and achieving "greatness" - continuous self-improvement and progress.

The author says some people settle for mediocrity but readers should commit to constantly improving themselves - becoming better each day. The book aims to help readers do this.

- The author discovered the Law of Attraction during a financial struggle in university. The Law of Attraction states that your thoughts attract your reality - whatever you focus on will come to you.
- The author wanted to go on holiday with friends but needed more funds. He focused on attracting the money he needed, about £500.
- A week later, he received notice from the tax office that he may be owed a tax rebate. He provided details to the tax office but grew frustrated waiting for a response. He was running out of time to join his friends on holiday.
- After following up again, another week went by with no word. He gave up and told his friends to book without him. However, a few days later, he received a cheque for £800 from the tax office.
- The cheque cleared in time for him to join his friends on holiday. He became a believer in the Law of Attraction and committed to using it to change his life.

The key points are:

1. The Law of Attraction says your thoughts manifest your reality. Focus on what you want, not what you do not want.
2. The author tested the Law of Attraction by focusing on attracting the £500 he needed for a holiday. He received an unexpected tax rebate for £800, allowing him to join his friends.
3. The Law of Attraction worked for the author, turning him into a believer and motivating him to apply it to change his life.

The author notes that while the Law of Attraction requires positive thinking, consistently maintaining positive thoughts can be difficult. Something is missing that helps to sustain positive thinking.

- The author struggled to remain optimistic in difficult times and would often get angry and destructive. He went through periods of highs and lows.

- In his final year of university, a group project went wrong and caused much stress. He felt like quitting and blamed his mother for pushing him into university. He applied unsuccessfully for jobs he was unqualified for.

- He attended his sister's wedding in India, which shifted his mood and helped him feel calmer. He was then motivated to finish his degree. He imagined getting a good score and worked hard, eventually passing comfortably.

- He is had mixed success applying the Law of Attraction but has since discovered the Law of Vibration, which states that the Universe responds to your energy and vibration. According to this law, your thoughts affect your reality.

- The Law of Vibration suggests that everything is vibration, including all matter and energy. The frequency of vibrations determines the state of matter and how we perceive things.

- The author has seen positive changes from applying the Law of Vibration. While some criticize these metaphysical laws as lacking evidence, others like Bruce Lipton and Gregg Braden argue they are supported by science. The author finds the Law of Vibration personally resonates with him.

- The Law of Vibration proposes that you can shape your reality by changing your vibrations and energy. Negative vibrations attract more negativity, while positive vibrations attract more positivity.

• Reality is perceived through vibrations compatible with what we can sense. We can only perceive a limited range of vibrations through our senses. Outside this range, other vibrations still exist but we cannot perceive them. For example, we can only hear sounds within a specific frequency range. Dog whistles emit sounds outside of human hearing range.

• According to the author Kenneth James Michael MacLean, reality depends on how we interpret vibrations. Everything, including our thoughts, senses, matter and energy, vibrates at specific frequencies. We can change our reality by changing our thoughts, feelings, speech and actions, which are all vibrational.

• To perceive something or make an idea real, we must match its vibrational frequency. The more solid and real something seems, the closer we vibrate to it. When we believe in something and act as if it is accurate, we increase our chances of perceiving it in reality.

• To receive or perceive what we want, we must be in energetic harmony with it. Our thoughts, emotions, words and actions must align with our desires. This can be likened to two tuning forks calibrated to the same frequency—when one is struck, the other will also vibrate. Similarly, to tune into a radio station, we must match its broadcast frequency. Matching a vibration attracts related things into our reality.

• Our emotions reflect our vibration and what we are attracting. Feeling suitable means thinking, taking positive action, and attracting good things. Positive emotions have a high vibration and attract what we want. Negative emotions have a low vibration and attract what we do not want.

• To receive good vibrations, project good vibrations. The vibrations we emit return to us through matching experiences. Self-love and raising our vibration are interconnected. Raising our vibration through positive action and a positive mindset helps us manifest good things and feel good. Loving ourselves helps us live the life we want.

• New positive habits and actions raise our vibration and make us feel good, which helps manifest more good things. Temporary actions may briefly raise our vibration, but consistent long-term habits have lasting results. Examples include surrounding ourselves with positive people, changing our body language to be more positive, expressing gratitude, meditating, moving our bodies, and sleeping well.

•Smiling releases endorphins that can make you feel good even when you have no reason to smile. Fake it till you make it. Acting happy can make you happy.

•Your body affects your mind. Change your body language and you can change your mood. Standing confidently, with your head up, can make you feel more confident.

•Take time for yourself. Get away from stresses and stimulation. Spend time in nature. Disconnect from social media and technology. Recharge and reset.

•Find inspiration. Read, listen to, or watch something inspirational. Be around positive, uplifting people. Their stories can motivate and encourage you, especially when you're struggling.

•Avoid gossip and drama. Spreading gossip lowers your vibration by making you feel judgmental. Discussing others' misfortune invites that same misfortune into your own life. Remove yourself from such conversations and direct them to more positive topics.

• Avoid drama and high-stress situations as much as possible. These negatively impact your emotional state and wellbeing.

• The ego seeks validation, instant gratification, and power over others. It identifies with a self-image and fears threats to that image. This can lead to defensive, aggressive behavior when one's beliefs or identity are challenged. Focusing on listening to others and improving one's life is better.

• Eat a healthy diet with many fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. These foods have a high energetic vibration and will make you feel good. Limit processed foods, sugar, and alcohol which have a low vibration. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.

• Express gratitude regularly. Counting your blessings helps shift your mindset to a positive one, improving your vibration and mood. Comparing yourself to those less fortunate helps put your own life in perspective. Saying "thanks" is good but feeling genuinely grateful is best. Focus on the gifts in your own life rather than what you lack.

• Greatness and happiness start with gratitude. You cannot feel joyful without being thankful. Gratitude transforms your energy and magnetizes more positive things for you. It helps you gain perspective on what really matters.

• The story describes a personal experience of the author where she had a manager she didn't get along with. Initially, she responded with resentment and negativity, which only worsened the situation.

• After watching some videos, the author realized she was focusing her energy on the problem rather than the solution. She started practicing gratitude by appreciating having a well-paying job. This helped shift her mindset and vibration. A few months later, her manager was promoted and she got a pay raise.

• The critical message is that we should not ignore negative emotions but instead study and understand them. The aim is to transform negative thoughts and feelings into something healthier and more positive.

• Repressing negative emotions can be damaging. We must identify our emotionsg, challenge the thoughts behind them, understand their deeper meaning, and replace them with empowering thoughts.

• The example of Sarah shows how this process works. Sarah felt sad and insecure when a love interest stopped texting her. By questioning her assumptions, she realized she was exaggerating. She saw that she based her self-worth too much on what others thought. She replaced negative thoughts with the empowering thought that she was worthy of love regardless of others. Visualizing a memory of feeling confident helped boost her self-belief.

• The overall message is to observe our thoughts and emotions, dig into their deeper meanings, and shift into a positive and empowering mindset. This is key to growth and well-being.

Here is a summary of the key points:

•Spending too much time focused on the past or future prevents us from living in and enjoying the present moment.

•Being present raises our vibration and brings more joy and peace. It helps reduce anxiety, stress and fear.

•Meditation is a valuable tool for developing awareness of the present moment. It helps calm the mind and gain access to inner wisdom.

•A short meditation exercise was provided with the following steps:

1. Assess your initial energetic vibration on a scale of 1 to 10. Could you write it down?

2. Find a comfortable place to sit or stand. Become aware of your body and breathing.

3. Open your eyes and observe your surroundings without judgment. Then close your eyes.

4. Observe your thoughts and let them pass without judgment. Focus on your breath.

5. Listen to the sounds around you and your breath. Distinguish foreground from background noises.

6. Bring awareness to your whole body. Notice any tensions or sensations. Observe any emotions arising. Sit still for 1 minute.

7. Reassess your energetic vibration. Has it increased? Repeat the exercise if needed.

•Recording the meditation steps on your phone can help if you have trouble remembering them.

•Making meditation a habit by practicing for 15-30 minutes daily can lead to significant benefits like decreased anger and increased joy and calm. However, start with whatever time you can and build up from there.

• Meditation requires awareness of your breath. Start with just 15-30 minutes a day and build up gradually.

• Breathing is essential for life and transformation. With each breath, you take life force energy and vibrate with new life. Controlled breathing calms the nervous system.

• It's not selfish to distance yourself from toxic people who bring you down. You must save energy for yourself. Your relationship with yourself is the longest one you will have. Manage it well to manage other relationships.

• Toxic people criticize, lack respect, manipulate, and belittle you. Ending these relationships allows positivity to flow and space for growth. However, first, review your behavior and change any toxic tendencies.

• Even those promoting positivity do not always follow their advice. When called out, they often shift blame rather than take responsibility. It would help if you believed others when they said they felt hurt by you. Understand why and make it suitable.

• Healthy relationships allow vulnerability without punishment. Toxic relationships punish to cover flaws and feel superior. The punished partner feels low and questions themselves. Walking away shows bravery, even with stumbles. A good partner lifts you.

• Choose partners who make you feel good about yourself. Surround yourself with people who appreciate you for who you are, treat you with kindness, and support your growth. They will lift you up and help you see your own light.

• Emotions like jealousy, doubt and hatred can decrease your self-worth, confidence and energy.

• Your mind may suggest negative ideas that fuel your insecurities and pain. You may then project your pain onto your partner by accusing and manipulating them.

• This leads to conflict and damage. You need to understand if the actions are due to insecurities or toxicity. You can't demand respect but you can leave toxic situations.

• Relationships require work, communication and understanding. However, leave if you lose yourself. Unhealthy relationships drain you as you give too much to someone who will not match your efforts.

• You may love someone's potential but know you are clinging to false hope. You cannot change those not ready to change. Getting out of toxic relationships is hard, but you are worth it.

• Ask what you would advise a loved one in the same position. Your intuition already knows the answer. Relationships should add value and bring good vibes. Leave if it is toxic.

• Choose real friendships. Simplify and keep those who add value. Remove those who do not. Virtual friendships have changed 'friend' to mean anyone. Many friendships lack support.

• Consider if friends show support, applaud wins, and encourage growth. If jealous or hateful, they are the wrong people. True friends want your best. Do not settle for mediocre friendships with negative energy.

• People grow at different rates. Some have slow growth due to a lack of willingness to improve. Do not let their limitations hold you back. Choose to be around those with maturity and personal progression.

• Be authentic and attract real connections. Show interest in others and build meaningful bonds based on shared values and life goals. Nurture the relationships that nourish you.

- Some people remain stuck in dissatisfying life situations and resist change. They get comfortable with complaining but do not take action to improve their lives.

- You may outgrow these people while pursuing personal growth and new interests. While friendships change, you can still appreciate what you learned from them. Focus on your journey.

- You may even outgrow toxic family relationships. Just because someone is family doesn't mean the relationship is healthy or you must maintain closeness. Sometimes distance or ending the relationship is necessary for your well-being.

- Try to understand your family's perspective and intentions, even if you disagree with them. Their views are shaped by their own experiences and beliefs. Open communication allows you to build understanding and shift their perspective over time. However, you cannot force them to change their views.

- Lead by positive example through your attitudes and actions. This can inspire gradual change in others and improve relationships. Appreciate the good in people who challenge you and create distance when needed.

- You can only change others if they want to change themselves. You can only influence them and facilitate their change if they become motivated.

- If a relationship involves harm, you may need to cut ties for your safety and wellbeing. Your happiness and security should be the priority.

- Be cautious about taking on other people's troubles and negative emotions. While supporting others, make sure to also take care of yourself. Don't let their low moods bring you down and deplete your emotional resources.

• Protect your energy first. Your emotional state and vibration must be high to help others effectively. Otherwise, you may suffer energy drains or emotional impacts.

• Handle negative people by maintaining your high vibration. Remind yourself that negativity from others is unavoidable. Do not react to them. Remind yourself that:

› Misery loves company. Low vibration people want to drag others down.

› People oppose progress. Some feel threatened by the success and confidence of others. They want to diminish others to feel better about themselves.

› Hurt people hurt other people. How people act reflects their inner state. Hurt causes more hurt. However, inflicting hurt on others does not heal one's pain.

› People dislike difference. People tend to like those similar to themselves. They do not understand those very different from them.

› What goes around comes around. While waiting for karma to catch up, do not get caught up in emotions. Maintain your high vibration.

The key is to remain peaceful by maintaining your high vibration and not reacting to the negativity of others. Protect your energy and joy. Do not let the actions or words of others diminish you.

Mind takes a back seat:

- If someone persistently accuses you of something false, like violence, you may eventually react angrily, even if it is invalid. Your actions then make the rumor seem authentic.
- Do not let the cruelty of others define you.
- Those who judge others reveal their own insecurities and limitations. They will not find joy or success in judging others.
- You cannot please everyone, so do not try. Focus on yourself.
- Responding to everyone is impossible and leads to being overwhelmed. Prioritize yourself.

Let your good vibes protect you:

- Some negative people dislike positivity. Stay so positive that they avoid you.
- When you raise your frequency, you seem less "real" to those at a lower frequency. This incompatibility leads to discomfort around each other.
- React with kindness to rudeness, and the rude person will not know how to respond. Their negativity repels them from your positivity.

Dare to leave a toxic job:

- Avoid toxic people and situations like you would avoid a dangerous alley.
- An unfulfilling job can be toxic. Quitting is risky but worth the peace of mind. Staying too long sabotages you.
- While security and comfort appeal, you cannot control keeping a toxic job. Take a chance.
- Difficult experiences before starting over provide wisdom to create a better life now.

- You can be self-important by caring for yourself, enjoying solitude, positive self-talk, and becoming self-reliant. Do not rely on others for your worth or needs.

- We often seek external validation and approval from others through our achievements, looks, or work. This makes us feel loved and important. However, it creates pressure to please others constantly.

- We create financial burdens trying to impress people who don't care about us. We change ourselves to fit in rather than be our authentic selves. We chase external goals and neglect our personal growth.

- Sharing love and kindness with others can transform the world. However, we must be kind to ourselves first. Accept yourself as you are instead of trying to change. Focus on your well-being, and you will be better able to change the world.

- Lacking self-love makes us insecure and damages our confidence, health, and relationships. People prefer being around those who accept themselves.

- A story illustrates how lacking self-love hurt a relationship. Insecurity and lack of trust caused damaging behavior.

- Appreciate your physical beauty. Don't let social ideals of beauty lower your self-esteem. There are no rules to beauty. Accept and love yourself as you are.

- Comparison steals our joy. Do not compare yourself to others. Focus on your journey. The story shows how comparison and judgment caused insecurity and embarrassment in childhood.

- Parents can instill the habit of comparison in children by praising other kids for motivating their own. This is damaging even with good intentions.

- Only compare yourself to your past self to see your growth and progress. Be proud of how far you've come rather than envying where others are.

- Your worth is not defined by what you own or how much you earn. You are enough as you are. Release society's standards of success and focus on what really matters to you.

- Choose self-acceptance over self-judgment. It will transform your life and relationships. Make self-love a habit and share that love with others.

• Comparing yourself to others, especially on social media, can be damaging to your self-esteem and mental health. Social media only shows curated versions of people's lives, not the whole picture.

• Focus on your journey and progress, not what others do or achieve. Your competition is your past self. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.

• Value inner beauty - kindness, compassion, and character - over superficial qualities like physical appearance. True beauty is more than skin deep.

• Celebrate your achievements, both big and small. Be proud of yourself for how far you have come and what you have accomplished. Do not be too self-critical.

• Respect your uniqueness. Do not change who you are to please others or fit in. Following the crowd means giving up control of your life and happiness. Question why you do what you do - are you choosing for yourself or following others?

• Fear and scarcity are often used to control people and make them conform. However, living the life others tell you to, instead of the one you want, leads to anxiety and low self-esteem.

• Your individuality is a gift, not a burden. By being yourself without apologizing, you open yourself up to opportunities and experiences you would miss by following the crowd. Stand out, do not blend in.

• Don't let others dictate how you should live your life. Follow your heart and beliefs, not what society or your family expects of you.

• Be authentic and embrace your uniqueness. Do not change who you are to please others or fit in.

• People will judge you no matter what you do, so do not worry much about what others think of you. Focus on living life on your terms.

• Be wary of psychological tricks and marketing ploys that try to influence how you think and act subtly. Do not let outside forces sway your individuality.

• Forgive yourself for your mistakes and imperfections. Learn from your errors and be kind to yourself. Your worth is not defined by what you did wrong in the past.

• Surround yourself with people who appreciate you for who you are. Do not waste time trying to please those who constantly put you down or judge you for being yourself.

• Let go of past hurts and forgive those who have wronged you. Forgiveness is for your well-being, not because the other person deserves it. Holding onto resentment only brings you down.

• Believe in yourself and maintain a positive mindset. Your thoughts and beliefs shape your reality. If you think you can achieve something, you will have a better chance of succeeding. But if you believe you will fail, you likely will.

• A positive attitude leads to a positive life. Choose empowering thoughts over limiting ones. Even in difficult situations, try to find the silver lining. Your perception and outlook make a big difference.

• Negative thoughts discourage action and make achieving goals less likely. Positive thoughts encourage action and increase the chances of success.

• Believing something is impossible focuses you on obstacles rather than possibilities. Having an open, optimistic mindset allows you to see opportunities where others see obstacles.

• Your perception shapes your reality. Different people can perceive the same thing in very different ways based on their beliefs and experiences. Question your beliefs and make sure they empower rather than limit you.

• Your subconscious mind shapes your beliefs. It absorbs information without judgment, so you must be careful about the messages you expose yourself to. Limit negative influences that sow self-doubt.

• You are not your thoughts. You can observe your thoughts and focus on the ones that empower you rather than those that disempower you. Your reaction to events shapes your experience more than the events themselves.

• small changes can lead to unpredictable outcomes. One positive thought can change your mindset and open up new possibilities. The key is changing how you perceive and respond to what happens to you.

• The key to happiness and success is learning to control your mind's reactions rather than trying to control external events. Cultivate awareness of your thoughts and make empowering choices.

Even the slightest change in our thoughts and beliefs can significantly impact our perception and outcomes in life. Our beliefs are deeply embedded in our minds, so changing them requires conscious effort and time. To change a belief, we must first identify the belief we want to change and find evidence that contradicts it. Reading stories of others who have overcome similar beliefs can help build a case against our current beliefs.

Repeating affirmations, or positive statements about our goals and desires, is another way to change beliefs. Affirmations should be in our own words, stated as if already confirmed, and repeated regularly. The more we say them, the more our subconscious accepts them as truth. Words have power and the messages we communicate to ourselves and others can have a significant impact.

Before pursuing our goals, we must get clear on our intentions. Unclear intentions will lead to unclear outcomes. Setting a specific intention directs our subconscious mind and helps ensure we achieve what we want.

- Set goals that reflect what you truly want, not what you think you should want to impress others. Your goals should mean a lot to you and improve your life.

- Write down your goals in detail. This helps make them tangible and keeps you focused. Some tips for writing down goals:

› Use a pen and paper. This creates an impression in your mind.

› Be honest and write what you want.

› Write in the present tense as if you have achieved the goals.

› Make the goals positive. Focus on what you want, not what you do not want.

› Write in your own words and voice. Make the goals easy to understand.

› Be as specific as possible. The more details, the better.

› You can include a timeline or not. See what works for your motivation and confidence.

› Start with smaller, achievable goals to build your confidence.

- Visualize experiencing your goals as if they are already confirmed. Engage all your senses—the more vivid and emotionally evocative the visualization, the more effective. Your brain can't tell the difference between vividly imagined and authentic experiences.

- Vision boards with images of your goals can help with visualization. Look at them regularly to stay focused on your intentions.

- With practice and persistence, visualization and setting clear goals can help manifest your desires. Several successful people attribute their achievements in part to these techniques.

- The Universe is supporting you in achieving your goals. Do not worry about how it will happen; focus on what you want. The Universe will provide signs to guide you.

- You have to act on the signs and ideas the Universe provides. Having intention and desire is not enough; you must take action. Even small actions, or "baby steps," can help build momentum. Pour your effort into these small actions.

- Making excuses, like lack of time or money, will only hold you back. If you want something badly enough, you will find a way. Growth requires leaving your comfort zone.

- Expecting change without changing anything yourself won't work. You have to take action and make adjustments to achieve your goals.

- The easy route is often not the most effective. Some goals require hard work and effort. Many people know what they need to do but do not commit to it, instead looking for shortcuts.

- Consistency is critical. Do not follow a plan halfway and give up because it is "not working." Stay consistent and patient to achieve results.

- Great pain and pressure can force change, but do not wait for this point. Take action now. Ask yourself how badly you want your goals and if you want them more than you fear the hard work required.

- Keep a positive mindset, believe in yourself, and do not give up. With dedication and persistence, you can achieve amazing things.

• If you only do part of a plan or give up quickly, you cannot expect total results. Consistency and commitment are essential.

• With regular practice, you can form good habits and achieve your goals. Lack of time is not an excuse; make goals a priority.

• Extraordinary people take action even when they do not feel motivated. Commitment and grit set them apart. Motivation comes and goes, so proceed anyway.

• Procrastination delays goals and dreams. It is a habit to overcome. Break big goals into small, manageable steps. Meet deadlines for each step.

• Reduce distractions and temptations. Give yourself incentives and rewards for achieving steps. Take breaks when needed to renew motivation.

• Do not over-research or overanalyze. Have the confidence to start, even if you start small. You can make adjustments as you go. Fear and doubt hold many people back.

• Success comes from repetition and practice. Stay consistent and committed to the best results, even if progress seems slow. Breakthroughs often follow times of struggle.

• Review methods and approaches periodically. Be willing to adapt to changes needed for the best progress. If something isn't working, try a new strategy.

• Use your intuition and passion to guide your actions and choices. If something feels wrong or draining, it will not lead to success or happiness.

• High motivation and vibration help in achieving goals. Take steps to raise your vibration and motivation when low. Recharging and new inspiration can renew your motivation.

In summary, extraordinary results require consistent commitment and practice. Overcoming procrastination, distraction, and doubt is critical. Start now, adapt as needed, and stay motivated for the best chance of success. Let your intuition and passion guide you.

1. Take enjoyable breaks. Schedule fixed time periods for breaks and stick to them. For example, schedule time to watch an episode of a TV show and not stay within that time.

2. Make your tasks more enjoyable. Play music while doing mundane activities. Sing along to raise your mood.

3. Ask for help if you need it. Talk to someone who has recently accomplished a similar goal. They can provide inspiration and guidance.

4. Give yourself consequences for inaction. For example, tell yourself that you cannot watch TV if you do not go to the gym. Tell others about it to ensure accountability.

5. Tell friends about your goals. This provides accountability so they can check your progress and encourage you.

6. Have patience. Quick fixes and instant gratification have led to a culture of impatience. Most goals and desires take time. Accept where you are and stay optimistic. Growth and progress happen over time.

7. Swap short-term pleasures for long-term gains. Partying or other leisure activities in excess can deprive you of achieving your goals and purpose. A balance of work and play is needed. Investing in books or self-education can be more valuable than expensive drinks.

8. Have faith, not fear. Fear keeps you comfortable and hinders progress. It makes you avoid challenges and new experiences. Replace fear with faith and optimism. Faith helps you explore new possibilities, even without assurance of outcomes. Let go of fear-based assumptions and worries. They bring more of what you do not want.

9. Flow with the Universe. Once you align with the Universe, things will unfold for your highest good in your own time. Forcing outcomes breeds resistance. Embrace good vibes and let things flow. What is meant for you will come to you.

• Painful experiences often lead to growth and positive change. While going through hardship is difficult, there are usually lessons to be learned that make us stronger and wiser.

• Challenging times happen for a reason, even if that reason is not apparent. Have faith that there is purpose behind your struggles.

• Life lessons will repeat themselves until they are correctly learned. Pay attention to the messages the Universe is sending you.

• Notice warning signs and avoid unhealthy choices and behaviors. Do not ignore lessons you have already learned.

• Everyone has a higher purpose to fulfill in life through being of service to others. Find your purpose to experience meaning and joy.

Does this summary accurately reflect the main points? Let me know if you want me to clarify or expand the summary in any way.

• We all have a purpose or calling in life that gives us a sense of meaning and fulfillment. However, many conform to society's expectations and neglect our true purpose.

• We can gain enjoyment and satisfaction from various life roles and activities, but lasting fulfillment comes from pursuing our deeper purpose - the reason we were created.

• Like a soccer ball, we may go through life experiencing many events and interactions but feel unfulfilled until we discover our purpose - the reason we were designed. Once we find our purpose, life makes sense.

• While physical needs and responsibilities matter, life is meant to be more than basic survival and accumulation. We have a higher purpose to serve others in our unique way.

• Our purpose does not have to be heroic. We can add value by doing something we love passionately and sharing it with others. Following our excitement and interests can lead us to our purpose.

• We should act on what excites us without having everything figured out. Small steps in the right direction will lead to more significant opportunities. Our purpose may evolve into our source of income over time.

• There is an intention and meaning behind each life. We are here to help, love, inspire, and make a difference in our way. When we discover our purpose, we experience abundance.

• Money itself is neither good nor bad - it is neutral energy. How we view and use money depends on our mindset and intentions. Money flows to those with an abundance mindset who believe they deserve it.

• The idea that money is the root of evil or that wanting it is greedy comes from a perception of lack and limitation. In truth, abundance is infinitely available. We are meant to have enough to fulfill our life's purpose.

• Greed comes from a belief in lack, not from wanting enough to experience freedom and provide value. There is enough for everyone when we shift to an abundance mindset.

- You are worried you may not have access to much money again. As a result, even though you are being frugal, your negative mindset could lead to financial difficulties.

- We attract what we focus on. If we worry about lack and scarcity, that is what we will manifest. While saving money is prudent, maintain an attitude of prosperity and abundance. Believe you can attract wealth.

- We are often told to believe in lack and limitation. However, we have the power to create our reality. When people spread fear, it brings society down collectively.

- Money is available to all. Your attitude is the only barrier between you and abundance. However, you will need more than money to fulfill you. Find purpose and meaning by serving others.

- True happiness comes from within, not external things like relationships, experiences, or possessions. It is a state of high vibration and inner peace that remains steady despite life's ups and downs.

- Achieving lasting happiness requires spiritual growth and mastery over your mind. Choose positive thoughts, live presently, let go of comparisons and judgments, accept what is, and spread love.

- The journey to a more extraordinary life cannot be challenging, but taking steps daily builds momentum. Learn from failures and see them as guiding you to the right path. Trust your intuition. Release fear and connect to your higher purpose.

- You already have everything within to create an amazing life. Maintain a high vibration by loving yourself, and you will achieve your dreams, even if it takes time. Stay dedicated to your growth, and life will become extraordinary.

The author met a mysterious woman on a train who told her she had blessings from a past life but also things she needed to make right in this life. The woman told a captivating story about the author being a valued soldier in a past life who hurt many people. She said the author needed to control her anger and communicate positively in this life.

Though skeptical, the author was intrigued. When she got off the train, the woman somehow knew her name without being told. The author dismissed it as a coincidence.

Later, the author started an Instagram account to spread positivity. It proliferated, and people started asking her for life advice. She became a "mind coach," helping people change their thinking and live positively.

The author thanks her wife, sisters, agent, publisher, and social media followers. She founded the Bon Vita lifestyle brand to spread empowerment, wisdom, solutions, stories, and life lessons. She uses her influence to spread "Good Vibes Only" so people can achieve their potential.

The book covers self-love, the law of vibration, positive habits, making yourself a priority, self-acceptance, manifestation through thought and action, learning from pain, and finding your purpose. The author's mission is to change the world through sharing her message.
