- The author interviews Robert Stewart Jr., a newly minted federal contractor awarded a $34.5 million contract to supply 6 million N95 masks to the Department of Veterans Affairs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

- Despite some skepticism, the author agrees to accompany Stewart on a private jet flight to oversee the delivery of the masks to a V.A. warehouse in Chicago. The stakes are high for Stewart to fulfill the contract.

- Stewart presents himself as a successful contractor and military veteran, though the author later finds out Stewart exaggerated his military experience. Stewart claims to have 6 million 3M N95 masks ready to ship from a warehouse in Los Angeles to Chicago.

- The author acknowledges that Stewart seems out of his depth but also understands the desire to "fake it till you make it" and take significant risks and opportunities, especially during a crisis. The author is going along to see if Stewart can pull it off, recognizing it could either be an "American success story" or a failure.

- In summary, the key points are a new federal contractor landing a big contract to supply scarce N95 masks, the contractor's claims about having access to millions of masks ready to ship, the author's mix of skepticism and openness to an ambitious risk-taker; and the high stakes involved for the contractor to deliver on such a consequential contract during a pandemic.

The story will investigate profiteering and opportunism during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. The federal government needed to prepare or respond adequately, leaving states and hospitals desperate for supplies. Into this chaos rose myriad contractors and brokers seeking to make large profits, often through questionable means.

The story follows one such contractor, Stewart, who secures a massive contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs to supply 6 million N95 respirator masks. However, Stewart has yet to gain experience in the medical supply industry and seems ill-equipped to fulfill such a contract. The journalist accompanies Stewart on a private jet flight to a V.A. distribution center, but Stewart admits en route that he no longer has access to the masks he promised to deliver. Nevertheless, Stewart insists "faith" will allow him to find the masks and fulfill the contract.

The story suggests that Stewart's actions are emblematic of the greed, opportunism, and incompetence that compromised the U.S. pandemic response. The journalist sees "an ugliness that hides beneath our national mask," including greed dressed up as entrepreneurship, selfishness as individualism, opportunism as patriotism, and recklessness as bravery. A review of records from the pandemic era confirms that an obsession with unregulated capitalism severely hampered the U.S. response. Government failures to adequately fund and supply the national stockpile and other preparations left the country desperately vulnerable.

In summary, the story would use Stewart's strange tale to examine how profiteering and devotion to unfettered capitalism undermined the U.S. government's ability to respond effectively to the COVID-19 crisis. The story suggests these tendencies revealed some ugly truths about American society and values that typically remain hidden or ignored.

- The coronavirus pandemic revealed deep problems in the U.S. that were years in the making. Despite warnings, the government and healthcare systems were unprepared, and companies sought to profit off the crisis.

- The Trump administration responded slowly and gave out contracts that needed proper vetting. This led to fraud and waste, and delayed the provision of critical supplies. At the same time, some companies raised prices for essential goods like ventilators and N95 masks.

- The pandemic disproportionately impacted marginalized groups. Essential workers faced health risks, while the wealthy were mainly able to isolate themselves. The stock market rallied even as unemployment spiked. The crisis revealed the country's vast inequities.

- The author went on reporting trips to investigate the crisis, but found the situation could have been better than anticipated. The U.S. failed to come together like in past crises. Despite its wealth and advancement, the U.S. accounted for a disproportionate share of cases and deaths worldwide.

- The author interviewed a former Republican congressman, Denny Rehberg, to try and understand why the country was so unprepared. However, Rehberg avoided taking responsibility, blaming budget battles, the Obama administration, and hindsight. The author sees this as typical - no one wanted to take the blame for the monumental failures.

- In summary, the crisis revealed systemic issues in the U.S. that were years in the making. However, leaders should have taken responsibility for the lack of preparedness and unequal response. The situation was worse than the author anticipated, showing the deep problems in the country.

- The retired congressman from Montana answered questions about his time in office during a phone interview. He struggled to answer a hypothetical question about what he would do differently if he could do it all over again.

- In 2011, Republicans had just won control of the House. They opposed President Obama's Affordable Care Act and tried to thwart it by cutting funding to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which would implement the law.

- To force compromise, Republicans threatened not to raise the debt ceiling, which would cause an economic crisis. This led to the 2011 Budget Control Act, which cut spending across the government. The cuts would be triggered if a "super committee" did not agree to significant cuts.

- The Strategic National Stockpile, which stockpiles emergency medical supplies, was part of HHS. Its funding had been increasing under Bush and Obama to prepare for pandemics. In 2011, it was overseen by the House subcommittee chaired by Congressman Denny Rehberg, a rural conservative from Montana.

- Rehberg believed in cutting government spending and local control. He had suggested in 1994 that the government should not spend money on AIDS patients. As a congressman, he targeted programs like Pell Grants and free school lunches for cuts.

- In 2011, Rehberg's subcommittee cut funding for the stockpile from Obama's request of $655 million to $534 million, about a 10% cut. It was the first significant cut to the stockpile since 9/11.

The key details are
The retired congressman struggled with questions about past decisions;
Republicans forced spending cuts in 2011 to undermine Obamacare;
Congressman Rehberg believed in cutting spending and targeted even small programs; and
his subcommittee significantly cut funding for the Strategic National Stockpile for the first time in years.

- Mike Bowen has worked at Prestige Ameritech, the largest U.S. manufacturer of medical masks, since the 1990s. Despite ownership changes to revive domestic mask production, he has stuck with the company.

- In 2005, Bowen and a partner bought back Prestige Ameritech's old factory and aimed to attract U.S. customers by arguing that domestic mask production is vital for national security. However, their efforts have struggled.

- On January 22, 2020, Bowen arrived at his messy office, which contained records of all the warnings he had issued over the years about boosting U.S. mask production and replenishing the national stockpile.

- Bowen had warned officials as early as the George W. Bush administration about the dangers of relying on foreign producers and depleting U.S. mask supplies. However, his warnings were ignored as officials focused on theoretical threats like bioterrorism instead of more likely pandemics.

- In early 2020, as COVID-19 emerged in China, Bowen again warned officials that the U.S. only had 1% of the masks needed for a pandemic and that the national stockpile had not been replenished. Again, his warnings were brushed aside until U.S. cases surged in March. By then, the market was chaotic and China had restricted mask exports.

- Bowen argues that both parties are responsible for failing to heed warnings and not maintaining U.S. mask production and stockpiles. Their bipartisan failure has had devastating consequences, as healthcare workers faced PPE shortages during the worst public health crisis in a century.

Here is a summary:

- Mike Bowen, a Texas mask maker, had warned U.S. officials for 13 years that the U.S. was too dependent on foreign-made masks and vulnerable in a pandemic.
- Bowen built relationships with leaders at the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), including its director, Dr. Rick Bright. Bright and Bowen never met but bonded over their concern about mask supply issues.
- In January 2020, Bowen noticed a spike in mask orders from China and Hong Kong. He warned Bright that the U.S. needed to boost mask production.
- Bright agreed but struggled and needed help to get senior Health and Human Services (HHS) officials to take the coronavirus threat seriously. Bright wanted them to get information from China, boost funding and staff, and stock up on masks and other supplies. However, his boss and others were downplaying the threat.
- Bright forwarded Bowen's warning to colleagues, hoping to spur action. Hours later, a top HHS official responded dismissively, saying existing supplies were sufficient and brushing off Bowen.
- Bowen and Bright's warnings were ignored, leaving the U.S. unprepared as the virus spread globally. Bowen and Bright found themselves "immense in one obscure federal agency."

In short, Bowen and Bright sounded the alarm for years about U.S. mask dependence. However, they could not blast the issue "from obscurity into the American consciousness" until it was too late. Their prescient warnings were dismissed, leaving the country scrambling as the pandemic intensified.

Here is a summary:

- Rick Bright, director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), was increasingly concerned about mask and PPE shortages in January 2020 as the coronavirus outbreak worsened.

- Bright tried to warn HHS leadership about the impending shortages but was ignored.

- Bright connected with Mike Bowen, executive vice president of Texas-based mask maker Prestige Ameritech. Bowen had also warned government officials about mask shortages for years but to no avail.

- Bowen gave several media interviews in February 2020 to raise awareness of the issue. He mentioned Bright as someone who understood the gravity of the situation.

- Bowen's interviews and messages caught the attention of Steve Bannon, former Trump adviser. Bannon's team said they would pass the message about mask shortages to the White House.

- On February 7, Bright again warned HHS officials about mask shortages but was told the solution was for the CDC to tell people not to buy masks. Bright thought this needed to be an adequate response.

- Later that day, Peter Navarro's Assistant called Bright and summoned him to the White House to discuss the coronavirus response.

- Rick Bright, director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, had recently met with Peter Navarro, an advisor to President Trump, to warn about shortages of masks and other supplies needed to respond to the coronavirus pandemic.

- Navarro set up a call with Mike Bowen, the CEO of Prestige Ameritech, one of the last American mask makers. Bowen warned that the U.S. supply of N95 masks was at risk due to overreliance on Chinese manufacturers. Bright, Navarro, and Bowen worked together to draft a memo urging the White House Coronavirus Task Force to take immediate action to address mask shortages and ramp up production.

- On February 11, the World Health Organization named the new coronavirus disease "COVID-19." On the same day, Dr. Anthony Fauci said the risk to Americans was "relatively low" but warned that the virus could become a "global pandemic." However, there were already cases spreading undetected in the U.S.

The CDC said masks were unnecessary for the general public, even though the virus was already spreading in communities. The federal government still encouraged U.S. mask makers to export supplies to China into March.

- In Italy, the virus spread rapidly just weeks after the first cases were detected in Chinese tourists. This showed that the virus could spread even after travel from China was restricted. Containment was becoming unlikely in the U.S. and globally.

- On February 23, Trump said "we have it very much under control in this country," even though that was far from the truth. The U.S. was not prepared to handle the crisis that was unfolding.

Here is a summary:

- On February 25, President Trump tweeted that the coronavirus was "very much under control" and handled well by his administration. Privately, he admitted to downplaying the threat to avoid panic.

- A CDC official warned the next day that the virus would cause severe disruption, contradicting the president's message. In response, the stock market plunged.

- On February 26, Vice President Pence was put in charge of the coronavirus task force, signaling that the administration was taking the virus seriously and raising concerns that politics would guide the response.

- By February 27, price gougings and hoarding supplies like masks and gloves had begun. The administration urged people to refrain from hoarding supplies but the message backfired.

- On February 29, the first U.S. death from the virus was announced and cases were rising quickly, especially in Washington state. The state requested supplies from the federal stockpile but received only about half of what was requested.

- An internal analysis circulated in the administration concluded "we are going into a gunfight with a box of Kleenex tissues." Officials realized the virus was far deadlier and dangerous than the flu.

- At a Senate hearing on March 3, senators criticized the administration's handling of the crisis. Republican senators Richard Burr and Kelly Loeffler were revealed later to have sold off millions in stock after receiving classified briefings, avoiding significant losses. Other senators also made timely stock sales.

- The summary shows the administration needed to be faster to grasp the threat posed by the virus and provide a coordinated response. Early warnings from health officials were ignored in favor of political messaging. The crisis revealed issues with the national stockpile's supply and readiness. Moreover, it highlighted how government officials profited from insider knowledge before the pandemic caused economic turmoil.

- Rear Admiral John Polowczyk, the Pentagon's top supply chain expert, was called upon on March 15 to help the Department of Health and Human Services with logistics planning for the COVID-19 pandemic response.

- When Polowczyk reported for duty the next day, he found the HHS lacked a sense of urgency and direction. Officials seemed reluctant to act without approval from political leadership.

- Polowczyk was shocked to find the Strategic National Stockpile was managed using only Excel spreadsheets and a whiteboard. There was no advanced inventory system, unlike in commercial supply chains.

- By the time Polowczyk arrived, most of the supplies in the stockpile had already been distributed. He needed more to work with regarding personal protective equipment and other critical supplies.

- Congress needed funding to upgrade the stockpile systems and adequately supply adequate equipment. The stockpile was depleted just as the pandemic was intensifying across the country.

- No charges were brought against government officials, despite evidence that the stockpile was severely under-resourced to handle a large-scale health emergency. The case was closed without further action.

The critical failures were a lack of preparation, poor management of existing resources, and an unwillingness by political leaders to take responsibility for decisions that left the country vulnerable. The public only fully understood these shortcomings and management failures well into the crisis.

- Admiral John Polowczyk was charged with leading the Supply Chain Stabilization Task Force under FEMA to address the shortage of medical supplies like masks, gowns and gloves during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S.

- Polowczyk met with HHS officials and the White House Coronavirus Task Force led by Vice President Mike Pence to develop a strategy. They proposed a "supply chain taskforce" to find and buy medical supplies globally.

- Polowczyk questioned their initial unfocused approach and pushed for following the established Emergency Response Framework which involved:

1. Preservation: Rationing and reusing supplies
2. Acceleration: Speeding up the acquisition of supplies
3. Expansion: Increasing manufacturing of supplies
4. Allocation: Distributing supplies where most needed

- The White House announced the Supply Chain Stabilization Task Force led by Polowczyk. However, Jared Kushner also set up an unofficial "shadow task force" of private sector volunteers to help find and acquire supplies.

- Polowczyk was skeptical of Kushner's shadow task force of wealthy, inexperienced civilians outside official channels. However, Kushner recruited volunteers from companies like Google, McKinsey and Goldman Sachs to help address supply shortages.

- In summary, there were initially two parallel efforts: An official government task force following the established emergency response framework, and an unofficial private sector task force orchestrated by Jared Kushner. The private task force caused confusion and chaos despite good intentions.

- Jared Kushner assembled a group of young, inexperienced volunteers to help source PPE. They needed to be adequately vetted or trained government employees.
- Once officials realized the volunteers needed adequately qualified, they had them sign nondisclosure agreements and relegate them to less critical tasks like sifting through leads.
- The presence of the volunteers, dubbed the "Kushner kids," resulted in chaos and distracted from the main effort to source PPE, led by Admiral Polowczyk and FEMA.
- However, the volunteers did help sift through thousands of useless leads so Polowczyk's team could focus on legitimate leads. Polowczyk said he was grateful for Kushner's help in breaking down bureaucracy, even though Kushner's involvement also caused issues.
- Project Airbridge, which flew in PPE from overseas, was Polowczyk's idea, not Kushner's. However, Kushner took credit for the program and announced its launch, giving the impression that Trump and Kushner were directing the supply effort.
- Some complaints states loyal to Trump received preferential treatment in the distribution of supplies. Polowczyk denies this.
- The presence of Kushner and the volunteers highlighted the need for more preparation and the issues with having the Trump administration in charge of the response. The situation did not have to descend into chaos.

In summary, while Kushner and his volunteers provided some help, their involvement also caused significant issues, distraction, and chaos due to their lack of experience and qualifications. Kushner took undue credit for critical programs like Project Airbridge, further undermining confidence in the federal response. The situation speaks to the more significant failures in preparation and leadership.

- Ronald Romano, a New Jersey used car salesman, believed that governments and institutions were desperate enough due to the coronavirus pandemic to consider paying exorbitant prices for supplies. He texted an accomplice that "you might be buying a Ferrari" due to potential mask deals he was working on.

- Romano needed to gain experience in medical supply sourcing or government contracting. However, he aimed to sell millions of N95 masks to New York City for about four times the regular price, around $4 per mask. He enlisted a friend to resurrect a defunct company to broker the deal and a former Macedonian official to help broker it.

- Romano worried his plan might unravel after Peter Navarro, Trump's trade adviser, discussed the Defense Production Act during a White House briefing. The act gives the government first dibs on supplies from companies and activates penalties for hoarders and price gougers. While Trump had not fully invoked it yet, Navarro said it gave him "quiet leverage."

- Navarro also warned "hoarders" to sell needed supplies to the government at a "fair price" or face trouble. Romano likely worried this would make price gouging New York riskier.

- Romano aimed to exploit the pandemic and supply shortage for profit through questionable means. However, comments from Navarro on national television likely worried him by signaling potential consequences, even if the administration had not yet fully used its powers against hoarding and price gouging. The White House briefing thus may have complicated Romano's "Ferrari" ambitions.

- In March 2020, Andrew Romano and his associates tried to scam New York City out of $45 million by falsely claiming they could provide 7 million N95 masks. The city desperately needed PPE and medical supplies as COVID-19 cases surged.

- The city established an ad hoc group called the GAG team to vet vendors and weed out fraud. The GAG team caught Romano's scam and alerted authorities. Romano was later arrested and charged. However, many other scam attempts succeeded in bilking cities and states during this time.

- March 2020 felt like a "prolonged traumatic event" as the virus spread rapidly in New York City. Jackie Bray, a city employee, had her "oh shit" moment when she reviewed models predicting 60,000 hospital beds would be needed but the city only had 20,000. She realized they would have to build 40,000 more beds within two months.

- In response, the city mobilized hundreds of employees to the city's Emergency Operations Center to address three areas: space, stuff, and staff. They worked to set up temporary hospitals, reopen closed hospitals, book hotel rooms, and procure necessary supplies and equipment. Obtaining "stuff" like PPE, masks, and ventilators proved the most difficult.

- The city was in a "forced coma" as schools, businesses, and events shut down. However, city employees continued working, many out of the Emergency Operations Center, to handle the crisis.

That covers the key highlights and events in the provided summary. Please let me know if you want me to explain or expand on any summary part.

- At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, the city government had to scramble to purchase necessary medical supplies like ventilators, masks, gowns, and gloves. They needed to have established supply chains or purchasing procedures for a crisis of this scale.

- A woman named Bray was tasked with gathering data on hospitals' supply levels and burn rates to determine what the city would need. By late March, the city's hospitals were going through supplies at an unsustainable rate. Bray warned they would need 26 million N95 masks and vast amounts of other supplies over the next month, but the city only had a fraction of that.

- The city worked to set up new supply chains, awarding contracts to vendors who could provide supplies and working with donors and volunteers. They got creative, having companies that usually produced other goods start making things like face shields. They established contacts with factories in other countries to get supplies.

- The situation was dire, with over 1,000 COVID-19 deaths in the city by early April and hospitals still lacking critical supplies. The city was in a "moral conundrum," wanting to pursue any lead on supplies but risking wasting money on deals that fell through. They had to balance the risks of audits and bad press with the risk of not getting supplies.

- By April, the city had sorted through thousands of offers from intermediaries claiming to have supplies. They learned to verify offers more carefully but needed to figure out a few panned out. They brought in consultants to help set up direct relationships with manufacturers abroad. They could provide hospitals supplies to stay barely ahead of running out, but staff had to ration and reuse protective equipment in dangerous ways.

- To compete for limited supplies, especially ventilators, the city spent significantly, marking up prices. Some deals, like one for $162 million on ventilators from Singapore, fell through. The city was determined to beat out the state for supplies, showing the political rivalry between the city and state governments.

- Overall, the city's attempts to purchase necessary medical supplies during the first surge of the pandemic were frenzied, risky, and deeply challenging. They were mainly able to provide enough to hospitals, though at extremely high cost and effort.

- Peter Navarro is a blunt and abrasive figure who serves as an advisor to President Trump. He has extreme protectionist views and is hawkish on China. Many colleagues dislike him, but he has a "Rasputin-like" ability to influence Trump.

- Navarro warned the administration early on about the potential severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a March 1 memo, he recommended that the government ramp up the supply of essential medicines and medical equipment in case global supply chains are disrupted. He suggested increasing funding for health agencies, speeding up testing, exploring treatments like Regeneron's antibodies and remdesivir, and taking swift action as "an insurance policy."

- However, Navarro's warnings and recommendations were largely ignored due to his reputation and credibility issues within the administration. The administration needed to be faster to establish a coordinated national response. Navarro came close to becoming a hero in the crisis but was hampered by his abrasive style and reputation.

- The author finds Navarro a "uniquely American specimen" - bold, confident, persistent, but often unrealistic and off-putting. The author would like to meet Navarro in person to get a sense of this "tragic" yet intriguing figure, though Navarro did not respond to requests for an interview.

In summary, the key points are:

1. Peter Navarro warned early about COVID-19 but was ignored.
2. He made sensible recommendations to stock up medical supplies but needed more credibility.
3. He is a bold yet abrasive figure who fascinates the author.
4. The administration needed to respond faster, failing to follow Navarro's guidance.

The writer went into lockdown in March 2020 after learning that someone at a conference she attended had COVID-19. She began reporting on the disproportionate impact of the virus on minority and low-income communities. The data showed that the virus devastated Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Chicago, Milwaukee, and Miami.

The writer felt her contributions were limited, so she switched to following how the government was spending money to respond to the crisis. In late March, Congress passed the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, which included direct payments to Americans, aid for businesses, hospitals, and medical supplies. The writer and her colleague, Derek Willis, began scrutinizing the data on how this money was being spent.

In early April, the first round of spending data from the CARES Act was added to a public federal purchasing database. Willis began analyzing the data. The writer says Navarro, a Trump advisor, had given her more than a year's worth of stories based on how he pushed hundreds of millions of dollars to companies outside the typical government contracting process.

Navarro's actions broke the rules, but the writer says there is an argument that the usual rules did not apply during a crisis and the priority was getting necessary supplies. However, Navarro's personality, obsession with China and ties to people pushing hydroxychloroquine as a COVID treatment made it hard to determine if his intentions were good.

Navarro helped orchestrate one deal with Phlow, a new company formed in January 2020. With Navarro's pressure, Phlow got a $354 million contract to make drug ingredients. Emails show a consultant told Phlow's CEO to keep putting pressure on Navarro. Around the same time, Navarro tried to get Kodak a $765 million loan to make hydroxychloroquine, though nothing came of it.

The writer says she uncovered one of these deals Navarro helped arrange in early April. She ends by saying Willis began analyzing the spending data, which had given her more than a year's worth of stories.

The author and reporters analyzed hundreds of thousands of lines of government contract data related to the COVID-19 response. They noticed several issues:

1. Many delivery timelines for critical supplies like PPE, hospital beds, and testing equipment extended into summer and fall, suggesting the government was preparing for the pandemic to last a long time.

2. The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) office spent the most. The VA awarded $365 million in emergency contracts, much of it for PPE, with little vetting.

3. The largest no-bid contract, for $96.4 million, was awarded by FEMA to a Canadian company called AirBoss of America for powered air-purifying respirators. The contract specified it was "ordered by the White House," which was unusual. The author later found out the contract was directed by the White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, with little oversight.

4. Many new companies with little experience were getting large contracts. Some had connections to Trump officials, suspicious backgrounds, or were formed just before getting multimillion-dollar deals. Examples include:

- Aunt Flow, a tampon company that started selling masks. A $14.7 million V.A. contract was canceled when China seized the masks.

- Zach Fuentes, Trump's former deputy chief of staff, got a $3 million contract for masks 11 days after forming a company. Most of the masks could not be used.

- Panthera Worldwide, a tiny bankrupt company, got a $55.5 million FEMA contract for 10 million N95 masks.

- A boutique liquor company got a contract for surgical masks despite facing fraud charges.

5. Over $1 billion had gone to hundreds of first-time contractors by late April, fueling price gouging and shortages. States, cities and hospitals struggled to get supplies.

6. The VA's panic-buying suggested widespread shortages, despite denials. A $14.5 million contract went to Bayhill Defense, a new company, for N95 masks. The author was concerned that the masks might not meet standards.

The data analysis revealed chaos, inexperienced contractors, suspicious deals, and shortages within the government's pandemic response. The author was worried officials were doling out money with little oversight.

- The reporter was investigating Federal Government Experts, which had received a $34.5 million contract from the V.A. to provide 6 million N95 masks. This was the company's first federal contract and the owner, Robert Stewart Jr., needed more relevant experience.

- The reporter noticed many red flags about the company, including a vague and dubious website, no evidence of any employees besides Stewart, and plagiarized content on the site. However, the Wall Street Journal published an article on the topic before the reporter could, beating them to the story.

- The reporter decided to call Stewart anyway. Stewart claimed he was about to fly on a "noncommercial" flight to oversee the delivery of the masks but would not give details. He blamed reliance on China for the PPE shortage but his sources seemed to rely on Chinese labor.

- Stewart's story about the flight and whereabouts did not match what he told the WSJ. He seemed defensive about his integrity and blamed the WSJ article for making him look like a "crook." However, the reporter noted that the article barely mentioned him.

- Stewart described "intermediaries" and "middlemen" with multiple layers of private profit in the frenzied mask market. He said he would be rich if he had stockpiled masks earlier.

- In summary, the reporter found many reasons to be skeptical of Stewart and his company's $34.5 million V.A. contract. Stewart's stories did not add up, he seemed overly defensive, and he acknowledged the potential for huge profits and waste in the chaotic market for PPE. The reporter continued to investigate the deal and intermediaries involved.

Here is a summary:

- Robert Stewart Jr. claimed he had a deal to sell 6 million N95 masks to the V.A. for $34.5 million.
- He invited the reporter to join him on a private jet trip to Chicago to see the deal go through. The reporter got permission from his editors to join the trip.
- Once on the plane, Stewart admitted he had no masks or a line for obtaining them. His plan was based entirely on "faith" that he could find a new source and deliver the masks within 12 hours.
- Stewart also revealed that he planned an unscheduled stop in Georgia to pick up his parents to join the trip. This was concerning, given the health risks of COVID-19 and the fact that the reporter did not have proper protective equipment.
- Stewart explained that to complete a mask deal, a contractor gets a purchase order from the V.A. for a certain number of masks at a set price. The contractor must then find a source for the masks, often through a network of secret intermediaries and brokers. Everyone takes a cut of the profits along the way before the masks are delivered.
- In short, Stewart's claims of having a significant mask deal for the V.A. seemed dubious at best. The reporter realized he had been misled about many details of the trip and the deal itself.

- The U.S. federal government awarded a $34.5 million contract to a small company called Federal Government Experts LLC to procure 6 million N95 masks for the Department of Veterans Affairs (V.A.) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

- The company's owner, Robert Stewart, has yet to gain experience in supply chain or medical equipment. He planned to fulfill the contract by taking out a short-term high-interest loan, using the government contract as collateral, to buy the masks. He would then deliver the masks to the V.A. and use the payment from the V.A. to repay the loan plus interest and profit.

- Stewart worked with various mask brokers and intermediaries to find a supplier and source the masks. Each broker would collect a commission, adding to the total cost. The final cost to the government and profit for Stewart's company would be much higher than the actual cost of the masks.

- Stewart's original mask supplier fell through, leaving him scrambling to find another source just days before his deadline to deliver to the V.A. He claimed to now have connections to legitimate sources through a former Alabama attorney general and someone with connections to Vice President Pence's task force.

- The journalist accompanies Stewart on a private jet flight to Georgia to continue work on the deal. Stewart expresses anxiety about pulling off the deal and repeatedly mentions going to jail. The journalist questions why the government would award such a large contract to a small, inexperienced company and how much vetting was done.

- The final scenes show Stewart hurriedly trying to learn government contracting rules and build his company's operational capacity even as the deal deadline looms. The journalist compares it to the unlikely triumph of a young NFL draft pick lifting his whole family, even as he questions Stewart's competence and business practices.

Here is a summary:

- Stewart had promised to deliver 6.5 million masks to the V.A. but needed help following through. He kept making excuses and asking for extensions.

- Stewart's team, including Roosevelt "Trey" Daniels III, were making frantic calls to try and arrange transport for the masks. However, their plans kept changing, and they seemed unlikely to get the masks.

- Stewart asked Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee to draft a letter asking the V.A. to grant him a 72-hour extension. The VA agreed to the extension, even though they were growing concerned Stewart could not deliver.

- Stewart's parents came to support him, but seemed uninvolved in the actual deal. They got the group TGI Fridays takeout for what Stewart called "the last supper."

- Stewart agreed to share communications and documents with the V.A. to get the deal but claimed he could not access the files on his laptop. This further cast doubt on his legitimacy.

- Overall, Stewart had made big promises but could not follow through. His excuses and attempts to extend the deal suggested he did not have the masks. His team's frantic efforts could not save the deal.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key details and events in the passage? Let me know if you want me to clarify or expand the summary.

- The journalist accompanied Christopher Stewart, CEO of a federal contractor, on a private jet trip to try and procure N95 masks.
- Stewart claimed to have a connection, through a lawyer named Troy King, to a mysterious woman named Juanita Ramos who had connections to the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
- However, neither the journalist nor Stewart could find evidence that Ramos existed. Stewart eventually admitted that King likely made her up.
- Stewart's attempts to acquire the masks ultimately failed. His contract with the V.A. to provide the masks was canceled.
- The journalist reflected that fraud and profiteering often occur during crises like pandemics. She compared the COVID-19 pandemic to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918.

Food and resources were being rationed to support World War 1. Restaurants and food suppliers faced restrictions and scrutiny over price gouging. Government orders required people to stay home and wear masks, though some resisted. As the flu spread and deaths rose, people became desperate for information, protection, and cures.

Crooks and scam artists took advantage of the situation. A Brooklyn pharmacist sold fake aspirin, mostly talcum powder and dangerous acids. He was caught and sentenced to jail and fined. Advertisements falsely claimed "snake oil," and laxatives could prevent the flu, though they did nothing. Some doctors charged high fees to treat flu patients, leading to complaints. Articles noted that the citrus industry was poised to raise fruit prices to fight the flu.

More broadly, grocers, restaurants and others were hoarding and price gouging on goods like sugar and wheat. The Justice Department pursued charges against over 200 "food pirates." The worst profiteering was by "coffin trusts" that fixed and raised the prices of caskets during shortages. The poor and vulnerable suffered the most. In D.C., the cost of dying outpaced the high cost of living. The city could not keep up with deaths or find enough caskets. They had to hijack a train of caskets heading to hard-hit Pittsburgh.

These events echo today's COVID-19 crisis in many ways. People fight over masks and business closures. Hospitals are overwhelmed. Bodies pile up. Leaders disagree. People hope for miracle cures. We seem doomed to repeat history, though we have records of what happened.

The summary covers the critical details around profiteering and scams during the 1918 flu pandemic, the impacts, and comparisons to today's COVID-19 crisis. The Assistant focuses on the most relevant and essential elements to convey the essence and implications. Please let me know if you want me to clarify or expand the summary further.

Here is a summary:

• The author received a tip from Tim, who claimed to have insider information about Viral Protection Labs Medical Inc. (VPL Medical). This company had recently received $21 million in federal contracts to supply surgical masks.

• Tim said he had initially planned to work with VPL Medical as a broker to help them fulfill the contracts. However, he backed out after realizing the company was notcouldn't deliver the promised masks.

• The author investigated VPL Medical and found several red flags:

1. The company was new, having been formed just four days before receiving a $6.4 million contract from the VA for 8 million surgical masks.

2. Despite its newness, VPL Medical was able to quickly land large mask supply contracts from the federal government, suggesting inadequate vetting.

3. Tim's insider information suggested that VPL Medical needed the ability to fulfill the contracts and deliver the promised masks.

• The author theorizes that the federal government's desperation for masks during the pandemic and a lack of oversight created an opportunity for fraudulent companies to scam millions of dollars from taxpayer funds through empty promises of mask supplies.

• The author concludes that VPL Medical exhibits several suspicious qualities that point to it potentially being another case of pandemic profiteering and fraud at the expense of U.S. taxpayers. However, without further investigation, there is no definitive proof that the company failed to fulfill its contracts.

The key elements here are: a whistleblower tip, a suspiciously quick rise of a new company, large federal contracts despite a lack of experience, failure to fulfill promised work according to the insider information, lack of government oversight, and the motivation of pandemic desperation and profiteering. However, there are still open questions about VPL Medical's conduct and ability to fulfill its contracts.

- VPL Medical Supply landed two large federal contracts totaling $20 million to supply N95 masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- The company was newly formed and needed more expertise or experience in medical supply. Its listed owner, Bobby Bedi, had a history of failed businesses and legal issues.
- Tim Zelonka had planned to buy masks from VPL to resell but backed out when he learned the details of their operation. He said the actual owner of VPL was Jason Cardiff, a former car salesman, not Bedi.
- Cardiff told Zelonka the masks were in Ziploc bags, not adequately packaged as advertised. Zelonka said VPL should be "in jail."
- Zelonka had been furloughed from his job distributing juicers. He wanted to sell PPE to food service and retail businesses as they reopened.
- The reporter traveled to L.A. to meet Zelonka, who provided information about VPL but little hard evidence. The reporter found Zelonka odd but admirable in his efforts.
- The federal government awarded the VPL contracts without a bidding process under emergency rules. The reporter questioned whether the government had adequately vetted VPL before awarding the money.

The key points are that a dubious new company with questionable ownership and practices landed large federal contracts to provide N95 masks, raising concerns about lack of oversight and due diligence. A would-be whistleblower backed out of a deal with the company after learning troubling details, though he could not provide concrete proof of wrongdoing. The situation highlighted how the scramble for PPE led to many risky arrangements.

The author traveled with a mask broker named Zelonka to meet suppliers and potential buyers of masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Zelonka claimed connections to buy and sell millions of masks but had no masks or legitimate deals.

Zelonka first took the author to meet the owner of a t-shirt factory that had started making cloth masks. However, Zelonka did not buy any masks from them. Zelonka then claimed to have a deal with a venture capitalist to procure billions of masks, but the author needed to be convinced of the legitimacy of this deal.

Zelonka and the author then traveled to Rancho Cucamonga to surprise visit Viral Protection Labs (VPL), a company that Zelonka had claimed to work with to sell masks. However, Zelonka had already called VPL to tell them he was coming, ruining any element of surprise. When they arrived, someone from VPL answered the door. Zelonka could not reach the owner of VPL, Jason Cardiff, whom the author found had a history of running scams.

Ultimately, Zelonka needed legitimate mask deals or supplies to show the author. However, the author reasoned that the fruitless journey at least provided a glimpse into the chaotic world of mask brokers during the pandemic. Zelonka continued to claim he had deals in the works, but the author needed to be able to verify them before publishing the story.

The key points are:

1. Despite his claims, Zelonka had no masks or real deals.

2. The trip to visit VPL was ruined by Zelonka calling them ahead of time, and no one from VPL met with them.

3. Jason Cardiff, the alleged owner of VPL, had a history of running scams.

4. Although the trip yielded no results, it provided insight into the frenzied scramble for masks during the pandemic.

5. Zelonka continued to claim he had large mask deals in the works, but none could be verified.

Rick, I want you to know I am so proud of you. You did the right thing. You stood up for what is right against difficult odds and powerful forces. You reminded the world what a hero looks like. I have always admired your intellect and leadership. However, now I admire your courage and conviction even more. Let me know if there is anything I can do to support you. You just gained an army of allies. Keep your head high.

Here is a summary:

Dr. Rick Bright, the former director of BARDA, testified before Congress about the failures in the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bright was removed from his role after pushing for a science-based response and clashing with HHS leadership. In his testimony, Bright said the U.S. wasted crucial months due to inaction and the need for a coordinated strategy. He warned that the U.S. faced its "darkest winter in modern history without improvement."

Bright's testimony was divided along partisan lines, with Democrats supporting him and Republicans questioning him. Republicans cited anecdotes about hydroxychloroquine as evidence that it should have been pursued more aggressively. Bright said those claims were not scientifically valid.

Mike Bowen, the CEO of mask maker Prestige Ameritech, also testified. He backed up Bright's account and the emails in his complaint. Bowen had spent 13 years warning the government about mask shortages that should have been addressed. He blamed a lack of authority and purchasing know-how. Bowen offered to make masks for the U.S. in January but has yet to be committed. The government instead turned to other companies like 3M, which had offshored manufacturing.

Bowen and Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro have yet to agree. Navarro wanted an immediate, large order of masks at a high price. Bowen wanted a long-term commitment to buy masks from new manufacturing. Miscommunication and incompatible approaches prevented a deal that could have produced affordable masks for the U.S. stockpile.

In summary, the testimony revealed failures at multiple levels of government to prepare for the pandemic, despite years of warnings adequately. Politics, mismanagement, and poor decision making allowed the window to close on an opportunity to boost domestic PPE production before the crisis hit.

- Lucas Rensko moved from Hawaii to Texas for his wife's new job. To make some money, he was doing odd jobs on TaskRabbit, an app where people can hire others to do tasks for them.

- In June 2020, Rensko accepted a task that claimed to be a simple delivery. However, when he arrived, he found it was a bait-and-switch. The man who hired him, Jaime Rivera, revealed they were repackaging masks from China to sell to hospitals.

- Rivera claimed the masks were for residential use, not medical, but by repackaging them, city and state governments would buy them for medical use. He said they would not only look at the masks if they were repackaged.

- Rensko told Rivera he did not feel good about what they were doing and left. He told his wife, who told a friend and the author. The author then went to Texas to investigate.

- The author noted the differences in how California and Texas handled the pandemic. California, a blue state, was strict about masks while Texas, a red state, was against the "oppression" of masks. The author wished representatives from each state could battle it out.

- The author met with Rensko, who said Rivera called him the next day to apologize, indicating Rivera knew "something was up." They went to the warehouse, a run-down 5,000 square foot building.

- In summary, a man in Texas was hiring people through an app to help repackage masks from China to sell to hospitals, claiming the hospitals would not accept them otherwise. When one man objected, the leader apologized, showing he knew what he was doing was suspect. A journalist investigated the situation, highlighting the differences in how California and Texas handled the pandemic.

- The author investigated a report of people repackaging masks in a warehouse. He came across two men, Ricardo and another man, outside the warehouse chatting. Ricardo said the FBI was looking for two men who disappeared after bringing in and repackaging masks. Ricardo provided details about an American man named Brennan who imported nearly a million masks from China. A deal to sell the masks fell through when the buyer realized the masks did not meet FDA standards. Brennan then disappeared.

- The author looked into Ricardo, whose real name was Jaime Rivera, on social media. Rivera posted about getting paid to deliver boxes of masks all over Texas, mentioning payments from B.M., which stood for Brennan Mulligan. Public Venmo exchanges between Rivera and Mulligan showed Mulligan paid Rivera and others to repackage masks. Mulligan was importing masks from China into Los Angeles and then flying them into Texas, where Rivera would pick them up and deliver them to the Texas Division of Emergency Management.

- Rivera explained to the author that he started making deliveries for Mulligan in mid-April after responding to a delivery job on TaskRabbit. The deliveries were easy money at a time when his other work had dried up. He would deliver the masks to TDEM, who would then distribute them to hospitals. Rivera went from making local deliveries to delivering masks all over Texas. Receipts show Mulligan was importing the masks from China into L.A. and then flying them into Texas for delivery.

- In summary, the author uncovered a scheme in which Brennan Mulligan imported masks from China that did not meet FDA standards. He was paying Jaime Rivera and others to repackage and deliver those masks to emergency management in Texas, who then distributed the substandard masks to hospitals.

- Joseph Rivera was initially hired as a courier to deliver masks from a warehouse in San Antonio to buyers in Texas.
- In May, Rivera's role changed to helping repackage masks initially labeled "nonmedical" so they could be sold to hospitals. The repackaging was done to get around FDA crackdowns and inspections rejecting masks not approved for medical use.
- Rivera recruited local workers through an app to help repackage the masks. They were removing labels that said "nonmedical" and "medical use prohibited" and putting the masks into new packaging so they could be sold to the Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM) and then distributed to hospitals.
- Rivera claimed the repackaging operation slowed down because the warehouse needed to be bigger, leaky, and unsafe. However, they later admitted it halted because Homeland Security investigators had started asking questions.
- The "wallet" behind the operation was Brennan Mulligan, CEO of SKYOU Inc. Mulligan had connections for importing goods from China. Although SKYOU advertised PPE on its website, Texas needed a record of dealing with SKYOU.
- Texas eventually canceled its contract with the master contractor who had subcontracted to SKYOU after discovering the masks they received were "fraudulent." Texas paid over $14 million for those masks.
- The masks that SKYOU was repackaging and sending to Texas were a brand that the FDA had never approved for medical use. By repackaging them, SKYOU and Rivera circumvented efforts to prevent ineffective and counterfeit masks from reaching hospitals.

In summary, Rivera and Mulligan's company SKYOU was involved in a scheme to deceptively repackage and sell masks not approved for medical use to sell them to Texas and distribute them to hospitals during the pandemic.

- Greg Abbott is the governor of Texas, though the state has a weak-governor system where the lieutenant governor wields more power. However, Abbott has amassed power through connections and appointing loyalists.
- As governor, Abbott oversees Texas' large government and economy. However, insiders say Abbott shows little interest in governing and only acts when there are bad headlines. When there are problems, Abbott blames and fires agency heads.
- The reporter refers to the Texas government under Abbott as the "Abbott administration" to highlight how much control Abbott exerts. However, Abbott avoids blame for the administration's many failures and problems.
- Abbott's political power comes not from Texans or even gerrymandered voters but from appealing to right-wing media. Abbott reacts to please right-wing media, not govern well.
- For example, in 2015 Abbott called in the Texas State Guard to monitor the U.S. military's Jade Helm 15 exercise in Texas to appease right-wing conspiracy theorists. Abbott avoided criticism for wasting resources and embarrassing Texas by framing it as defending Texans.
- Abbott's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic shows his pattern of avoiding hard choices, blaming others, and framing self-serving actions as heroic. Abbott reopened Texas early to please right-wing media and donors but blamed local governments and individuals when cases rose.
- The reporter says Abbott only cares about his political ambitions, not governing Texas or protecting its people. Texans deserve a leader focused on the greater good rather than self-interest.

In summary, the passage portrays Greg Abbott as an incompetent yet politically savvy leader who avoids responsibility, blames others, and only acts to serve his interests rather than effectively govern Texas.

- As Texas attorney general, Greg Abbott frequently sued the Obama administration over issues like immigration, healthcare, climate change, etc., to appeal to the Republican base.

- In 2015, Abbott validated conspiracy theories about the Jade Helm military exercise by ordering the Texas State Guard to monitor it, attracting praise from radicals. This foreshadowed his handling of COVID-19.

- Abbott is politically savvy but needs robust policy agenda or relationships in the legislature. He focuses on short-term gain, fox News appearances, and campaigning. He uses threats and retaliation to control dissent within the GOP.

- In 2020, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick pushed to lift lockdowns to save the economy, suggesting the elderly should sacrifice themselves. Abbott surprisingly ordered a lockdown but needed clarification on superseding local mask mandates and ordinances.

- Abbott's order was a "nonlockdown lockdown" that likely slowed the spread but was poorly executed, showing his desire for control and inability to lead effectively during a crisis. His focus remains on appealing to the radical base rather than responsible policymaking.

- Former Rep. Sarah Davis says Abbott is paranoid of challenges to his power and acts self-interestedly. His lockdown order was like a "riddle" that took months for locals to figure out, showing his poor leadership.

- The summary describes Abbott as an ambitious yet ineffective leader who prioritizes politics over policy, radicalizes his base, consolidates power, and leaves governance riddles for others to solve during a crisis. His poor leadership and self-interest were evident during the pandemic.

- The author visited a warehouse of Fillakit LLC, a company awarded $10.5 million federal contract to supply test tubes and test media for COVID-19 testing across the U.S.
- The author went to investigate the company along with a journalist colleague who had noticed issues with the company's qualifications and ability to provide reliable testing supplies.
- When the author arrived at the Fillakit warehouse, the owner Paul Wexler aggressively confronted him and told him to "get the fuck out of here." The author warned Wexler that his actions would be reported in the story.
- Fillakit was contracted to provide supplies for PCR tests, the accurate laboratory tests that require properly preserving testing samples. This requires quality control and expertise that Fillakit did not have.
- The failure to have adequate testing early on severely hampered the U.S.'s ability to slow the spread of the virus through testing, contact tracing, and isolation. Fillakit's unreliable testing supplies contributed to this failure.
- The author argues that historians will see the U.S.'s delayed testing rollout and issues like the Fillakit contract as an essential reasons why the country's response to the pandemic was so poor.

In summary, the author details his encounter with the hostile owner of Fillakit, a company unqualified to handle a significant contract to supply COVID-19 testing materials across the country. This contributed to the U.S.'s failure to have widespread testing early in the pandemic, hampering efforts to contain the spread of the virus.

Without widespread testing and contact tracing, public health officials struggled to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. The federal government awarded emergency contracts to quickly ramp up testing, including a $10 million deal with a newly formed company called Fillakit to provide test tubes and swabs.

Fillakit was created just as the pandemic hit by Paul Wexler, a telemarketer with a history of fraud allegations and legal trouble. Wexler's previous company allegedly lured customers with promises of debt relief and levied unauthorized charges. The FTC sued Wexler, who settled while denying wrongdoing.

After reporters wrote about Fillakit's questionable credentials, a public health official found the test tubes Fillakit provided were unusable. They were soda bottle preforms—tiny plastic blanks blown up into two-liter bottles. The solution inside also seemed non-sterile. States were rejecting the tubes, but FEMA urged them to find a use to avoid blame.

A reporter staked out Fillakit's facility and saw workers unloading rental trucks. Wexler caught the reporter filming and aggressively told them to leave. The details suggested Fillakit was hastily repackaging whatever materials they could find to fulfill the government contract, while delivering an unusable product. The episode highlighted how the rush to ramp up testing allowed sketchy pop-up companies to exploit the crisis for profit.

The key elements are:

1. Lack of testing/contact tracing hindered pandemic response
2. U.S. gave $10M contract to shady new company Fillakit for test supplies
3. Fillakit owned by Paul Wexler, alleged telemarketer fraudster, sued by FTC
4. Fillakit's "test tubes" were unusable soda bottle blanks; the solution seemed contaminated
5. States rejected tubes but FEMA pushed them to use to dodge blame
6. Reporter stakeout found Fillakit hastily repackaging materials into unusable product
7. Episode shows sketchy pop-up companies profited from the rushed pandemic response

- The author describes driving to a large mansion in Orlando owned by Don Cisternino, who was indicted for fraud related to PPP loans.

- The mansion is 13,000 square feet with seven bedrooms, a guest house, pool, tennis courts, and a stable. It is valued at $4.8 million.

According to federal investigators, Cisternino obtained the mansion for free using PPP loans.

- The PPP program gave out $800 billion in forgivable loans to help small businesses pay employees during the pandemic. The loans were guaranteed by the SBA and distributed through banks.

- Banks had incentives to approve as many loans as possible, leading to fraud. Cisternino allegedly falsified loan applications to obtain millions in PPP funds, which he used to buy luxury items and a mansion.

- Cisternino fled the country after being indicted, but investigators sought to seize his assets. His case illustrates problems with the PPP program that allowed rampant fraud.

- The author argues that the government failed to properly oversee funds, allowing people like Cisternino to take advantage of the program. Tens of billions were likely lost to fraud, showing the need for more controls and oversight of government spending.

The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and other COVID-19 relief programs were hastily rolled out with little oversight and few safeguards against fraud. The Small Business Administration (SBA) prioritized getting money out quickly over ensuring funds went to legitimate small businesses in need.

As a result, the programs were rife with fraud. Many people lied on applications or used shell companies to obtain millions in forgivable loans. They then used the money to buy luxury items like cars, homes, yachts and jewelry instead of paying employees and essential business expenses as intended.

For example, an actor named Phillip Cisternino obtained $7.2 million for a dormant marketing company with no employees. He then used the money to buy expensive vehicles, real estate and pay off personal debt. A NFL player named Joshua Bellamy obtained $1.2 million for his company, which had few employees, and spent $100,000 on luxury fashion items. A reality T.V. star named Maurice Fayne obtained $3.7 million for his company and spent most of it on jewelry, cars, and child support, with some going to associates involved in a Ponzi scheme.

In the first year, over 120 people were criminally charged for PPP fraud totaling $570 million. The actual amount of fraud is likely much higher. The program's design and lack of safeguards allowed wealthy, well-connected individuals to obtain large loans while many small businesses struggled quickly. Public companies and large, profitable corporations also received substantial PPP money they did not appear to need.

The PPP and other relief programs were intended to help small businesses and their employees during the economic crisis. However, a lack of oversight and a "speed over accuracy" approach enabled widespread fraud and abuse, with funds going to those least in need. At the same time, many legitimate small businesses were left waiting.

Here is a summary:

• The Paycheck Protection Program distributed $800 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses during the pandemic. However, the program was flawed in its design and implementation, resulting in unequal distribution of funds and widespread fraud.

• Minority-owned businesses faced difficulties accessing loans. Studies found that banks showed bias toward white borrowers. The program's optional data collection on race and gender obscured the full extent of inequities.

• Fintech companies helped address some unequal relief by processing millions of smaller loans. Their automated systems appeared to show less racial bias. Two fintech, Blueacorn, and Womply, handled a third of all PPP loans and collected $3 billion in fees.

• The distribution of funds was incredibly flawed, with rampant fraud and waste. An investigation by ProPublica found that Kabbage, an Atlanta-based fintech, had awarded nearly 400 PPP loans worth $7 million to fake companies, many of them imaginary farms.

• The fake companies followed a pattern, using bits of personal information to create synthetic identities. Many traced back to Florida, Nebraska, Virginia, and New Jersey, where people had stolen their data.

• Kabbage was in dire financial straits when the PPP program began. The program offered a lifeline, allowing Kabbage to collect hundreds of millions in fees. Kabbage did a little review and approved 75% of its PPP applications. Former employees said managers had incentives to push through as many loans as possible.

• The federal government tried to hide data on PPP loans but was forced by a lawsuit to release it. Analysis of the data by ProPublica uncovered extensive fraud.

- The reporter received an email tip from a reader in Kansas that led him to discover Juanita Ramos, the self-described "medicine woman" he had been searching for.

- Ramos worked in the marijuana industry, advocating for legalization and farmers. She had no connections to the White House or Mike Pence, contrary to what Robert Stewart had claimed.

- Ramos got on a call with Stewart and Troy King after a friend in the hemp business connected them, thinking there was an opportunity to make money from Stewart's PPE contracts. However, Ramos was only tangentially involved and needed to learn more about the deals.

- Ramos met with the reporter at her new home in Austin, Texas and clarified that she had no direct role in helping Stewart get his contracts. She was confused about how she became a "mystery woman" in the story.

- Ramos' friend had heard about Stewart's $34.5 million V.A. deal and $3.5 million FEMA deal to buy masks and thought they could connect with Stewart to take a cut of the profits. However, they needed to gain experience in buying PPE. They were networking from home during lockdowns.

- Ramos was only briefly and tangentially involved, mainly through a friend's introduction. She did not know or connect Stewart to the White House. The reporter finally met Ramos, cleared up her minor role, and continued piecing together the strange story.

- The VA and FEMA's large purchase orders for PPE during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic attracted shady brokers and investors looking to make a quick profit. These deals often involved large amounts of cash due to the legal issues around marijuana.

- Two women, Ramos and her daughter Dawn, tried to help source PPE for healthcare workers and veterans through their modest connections in the medical supply chain and marijuana industry. A Boston-based firm contacted them called Boston Capital Consultants, which claimed to be working with the V.A.

- Emails show that Boston Capital Consultants and other brokers were aggressively marketing and inflating the prices of PPE to private investors. For example, one investor offered to buy 100 million N95 masks weekly at $3.71 each to resell to FEMA at $7 each, a 89% markup. These deals were largely fantastical given supply and production constraints.

- The owner of Boston Capital Consultants, Aaron Marcy Sells, claimed to have no idea what happened with these PPE deals and wanted to avoid being named in any reporting. However, business filings show he founded a PPE manufacturing and sales company around the same time.

- Ramos received many forged documents from anonymous investors, showing the rampant fraud and magical thinking in the PPE market. For example, one proposal claimed an English investor had $2 billion in funds and a deal with 3M, supported by forged letters from HSBC bank and a California energy company.

- In summary, the federal government's large PPE purchases and reliance on private brokers fueled rampant greed, price gouging, and fraud. Well-intentioned individuals like Ramos and her daughter were caught amid these shady networks and deals.

Here is a summary:

Utions LLC claims to use innovative marketing strategies based on behavioral science, but its website needs more clarity on what it does.

A businessman named Ingarra proposed a large deal to supply masks in the U.K. during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, many red flags suggested this was likely a scam:

1. Ingarra was based in Florida, home to many shady businesses.
2. The address for the billionaire investor was a modest residential home.
3. It was unlikely that such an ample supply of masks existed at that time.
4. A letter vouching for the buyer was found to be forged.

Ramos, who was involved in this deal, made little money and believes it shows how governments and others will waste time and money on scams as the pandemic continues. She worries that history will repeat itself.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spoke at an anti-vaccine conference, claiming a flu vaccine gave him a neurological disorder called spasmodic dysphonia 25 years later. However, this disorder is likely genetic and not caused by vaccines. Kennedy conflated fears like wealth inequality and authoritarianism with baseless conspiracy theories about Bill Gates and 5G being linked to COVID-19 and vaccines. The anti-vaccine movement overlaps heavily with other conspiracy theorists.

Kennedy and others at the conference aim to stoke fears and distrust in institutions like the CDC to push their anti-vaccine agenda, which has become more mainstream recently. Vaccines have always faced opposition, but the current movement is incredibly damaging.

The key points are:

1. Utions LLC and the mask deal seem highly dubious.
2. Ramos believes governments will continue to fall for such scams.
3. Kennedy promoted a debunked claim that a flu vaccine caused his disorder.
4. Kennedy and others fuse rational fears with baseless conspiracy theories to spread anti-vaccine propaganda.
5. Their misinformation campaign aims to undermine trust in health organizations and push a dangerous agenda.

- Conspiracy theories thrive during times of crisis and uncertainty as people seek to explain complex and threatening situations. The Trump era and COVID-19 pandemic have been fertile breeding grounds for the spread of conspiracy theories and misinformation.

- Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Joseph Mercola are two prominent spreaders of anti-vaccine misinformation, which have built lucrative empires by promoting pseudoscience and debunked health claims. Kennedy heads Children's Health Defense, which spreads anti-vax propaganda. Mercola runs an "alternative health" website and sells supplements and other products.

- The Center for Countering Digital Hate identified Kennedy, Mercola, and ten others as the "disinformation dozen" responsible for 65% of anti-vax misinformation on social media. They estimated this group's social media reach at 62 million accounts and $1 billion in revenue from platforms like Facebook and Twitter.

- Mercola has been cited or sued multiple times by regulators for false health claims but continues to spread misinformation, including promoting hydrogen peroxide inhalation as a COVID-19 treatment. He may have reached 4 million people directly during the pandemic and earned $7 million.

- Other spreaders of misinformation include Ty and Charlene Bollinger, who produce and sell anti-vax documentaries; Sayer Ji and Kelly Brogan, who promote pseudoscience through their websites and social media; and Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle brand.

- The anti-vax industry likely costs at least $36 million annually and employs over 260 people. The actual amounts are probably much higher due to a lack of transparency. These "pandemic profiteers" work together and promote each other to spread propaganda for financial gain.

- Their misinformation causes real-world harm, yet they face little accountability due to the reach and revenue they provide to social media companies and others. Regulation and pushback are burdensome and easier when audiences actively seek out and pay for the content.

- The author describes the chaos and violence at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the building to try and stop Congress from certifying Biden's election win. The author says it revealed the "underlying conditions" afflicting America, including the spread of misinformation, science denial, racism, and selfishness.

- The author says the violence resulted from "willful ignorance" spread by Trump, right-wing media, and others who profit from lies and conspiracy theories. The author fears this "cultural disease" will continue to lead to more violence.

- In April 2021, the author gets her second COVID-19 vaccine shot. While relieved, the author is also angry that over 570,000 Americans had died at that point, partly due to the spread of misinformation. However, the author acknowledges that the fast development of the vaccines showed the power of "capitalism" and the amount of money and resources the U.S. threw at the problem.

- The key ideas are that willful ignorance, and the spread of lies have seriously damaged America. However, the country's resources and "capitalism" also allowed for the fast development of the COVID vaccines, providing some hope. The author is relieved to get vaccinated and angry at the immense loss of life.

• The development of COVID-19 vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna was a remarkable scientific and industrial achievement made possible by decades of government funding and research.

• Key to the vaccines' success was the pioneering work of Dr. Katalin Karikó, a biochemist who spent years researching mRNA in obscurity before finally finding success. In 2005, she and a colleague published a critical paper showing how to use synthetic mRNA to induce cells to produce specific proteins without triggering an immune response.

• Karikó's research inspired scientists like Derrick Rossi and Robert Langer to found Moderna in 2010 to commercialize mRNA technology. BioNTech, founded in 2008 by Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci, also built on Karikó's work. Though the companies initially focused on other applications like stem cell research and cancer treatment, they were well positioned to develop mRNA COVID-19 vaccines when the pandemic hit quickly.

• The University of Pennsylvania licensed Karikó and Weissman's key patent to Cellscript, sublicensing it to Moderna and BioNTech for $75 million each, allowing the companies to profit from the scientists' publicly funded work.

• Though Pfizer did not accept funding from Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration initiative helped provide billions of dollars to accelerate vaccine development and distribution. Pfizer wanted to remain free of political influence, while Moderna benefited greatly from government funding.

• Thanks to years of scientific groundwork, Moderna and BioNTech were able to design their mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in just days after the virus's genome was published. The speed with which safe and effective vaccines were developed was a remarkable scientific achievement.

The U.S. government allocated around $18 billion to private companies through Operation Warp Speed to accelerate the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna, a biotech company, received about $483 million from the federal government in April 2020. In mid-May, Trump appointed Moncef Slaoui, a board member of Moderna, to help lead Operation Warp Speed. Slaoui resigned from Moderna's board but was allowed to keep his stock options, worth about $9 million.

Moderna's stock price rose dramatically in 2020 due to progress on its vaccine and funding from the government. By February 2021, Moderna executives had sold over $321 million in stock. Moderna's market value rose from under $6 billion in 2019 to nearly $129 billion in 2021. The government paid Moderna about $4.94 billion for 300 million doses of its vaccine.

Pfizer declined funding from Operation Warp Speed but benefited from a $455 million investment from Germany and promises from the U.S. to buy its vaccine. The U.S. paid Pfizer $6 billion for 300 million doses. Other companies like AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson also received billions from the U.S. government for vaccine doses.

At least 40 new billionaires emerged in 2020 with ties to companies that benefited from the pandemic. Executives and investors in vaccine makers sold nearly $2 billion in stock in 2020. The government funded much of the vaccine research and development but did not benefit financially. Many see this as an example of the pros and cons of public-private partnerships.

The vaccines successfully curbed COVID-19, but the process by which they were developed and distributed resulted in massive profits for corporations and the wealthy at taxpayer expense—sorting out who is owed what from these partnerships and deals may take years.

Here is a summary:

- Nursing homes have become highly profitable businesses, often owned by private equity firms incentivized to cut costs while taking in medically fragile patients who yield higher government reimbursements. This can lead to poor care and conditions.

- Studies show for-profit nursing homes often have more deficiencies and higher mortality. About 70% of U.S. nursing homes are for-profit.

- Jodi Gill placed her father in a nursing home called Brighton in the fall of 2019 because he needed 24/7 care after a fall. Even before COVID-19, she noticed the facility's poor conditions and care issues. Brighton had a long history of citations for various deficiencies.

- In March 2020, Brighton went into lockdown due to COVID-19. For two weeks, Jodi could not reach her father by phone. She started writing him cards, worried about conditions inside. The facility claimed infections were contained, but Jodi learned that was false.

- By April, Brighton had many COVID-19 cases and deaths. Jodi tried transferring her father but could not. She filed complaints about not knowing his condition. She finally FaceTimed him on April 9; he had a low fever but tested negative.

- On April 10, Brighton asked Jodi to approve using hydroxychloroquine on her father. Despite concerns, she felt pressured to agree. For weeks after, she could not reach him by phone, threatening to call the police before finally speaking.

- Overall, the summary shows poor oversight, conditions and care in for-profit nursing homes like Brighton, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Jodi struggled mightily to get information on and help her father from afar.

Here is a summary:

- Robert Stewart Jr., who invited the reporter on a private jet to show him N95 masks that did not exist, pleaded guilty to three felony fraud counts in June 2021.
- Stewart faced up to 35 years in prison for defrauding the federal government of $38.5 million through false statements about selling millions of N95 masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- The reporter who exposed Stewart's fraud in an article the previous year attended Stewart's sentencing. The reporter noted how much Stewart appeared to have aged over the past year due to the stress and consequences of his crimes.
- Stewart was allowed to remain free for four months after pleading guilty to make amends, but he had no friends or family with him at his sentencing. The other criminals sentenced that day were convicted of assault, theft, and other violent offenses, showing how seriously the judge took Stewart's white-collar crimes.
- The first fraud count against Stewart was for explicitly telling FEMA and the V.A. in emails that he had millions of N95 masks to sell, which led them to award him two large contracts. Had the government properly vetted Stewart, they never would have given him the contracts or the opportunity to commit fraud.
- One of Stewart's associates believed Stewart started with good intentions but got in over his head and turned to fraud out of desperation and for profit. However, prosecutors found clear evidence that Stewart deliberately defrauded the government from the start.
  According to the reporter, Stewart was a "pirate" who profited off the pandemic by preying on the government's desperation for PPE. Stewart's once colorful eccentric persona had been revealed as fraudulent, landing him in the courtroom with real criminals.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key details and events in the passage? Let me know if you want me to clarify or expand the summary in any way.

Here is a summary:

- Robert Stewart pleaded guilty to three federal charges: wire fraud, government funds theft, and false claims concerning the PPP and V.A. programs.

- Stewart created a fake company and submitted false documents to obtain over $1 million in PPP and EIDL loans. He used the money for personal expenses.

- Stewart had been fraudulently collecting V.A. benefits since 2013 by lying about being a decorated Marine Corps veteran. He stole $74,000 from the V.A.

- Stewart's friends wrote letters vouching for his character, but seemed unaware of the full extent of his crimes and lies. Some believed he was not responsible for the "catastrophe" of the government's PPE efforts.

- At the sentencing, the prosecutor argued that Stewart committed three distinct crimes, took advantage of a national crisis, and should receive a harsh sentence as a deterrent. The judge noted that Stewart knew what he was doing was wrong.

- The defense argued that Stewart "spiraled out of control" but was not an "evil person." With a new baby, paying restitution, and returning to school, the defense asked for leniency.

- The judge said he could understand how Stewart "got caught up" in the mask deals and working with brokers, but the premeditation of the other crimes had to be considered in sentencing. A light sentence would send the wrong message.

- In summary, despite Stewart's friends' letters and paying back money, his deliberate and long-running crimes, deception, and taking advantage of government programs during a crisis posed difficult questions around appropriate punishment and deterrence.

- The author takes a break from writing to attend a Colorado Rockies baseball game as COVID-19 cases are dropping in the U.S. and restrictions are being lifted. However, the country is still dealing with political and economic turmoil.

- The author visits Mike Bowen, the owner of Prestige Ameritech, a mask manufacturing company in Texas. Bowen shows the author his mask-making machines and warehouse. Although Bowen invested in advanced N95 mask-making machines, the government failed to help ramp up production during the pandemic. Now demand is decreasing.

- While speaking with Bowen, his vaccinated daughter wears a mask due to concerns over the emerging Delta variant of the coronavirus. At the time, little is known about the variant. The Delta variant will soon become the dominant strain in the U.S., causing cases to rise again.

- By the end of the author's visit, Bowen says they must increase mask production again due to the spread of the Delta variant and people acting irresponsibly. The story of the pandemic is ongoing.

- The author notes that while 40% of Texans are fully vaccinated, the vaccination rate is slowing. The Delta variant is already circulating in Texas, showing how contagious it is by infecting 185 fully vaccinated inmates at a prison. The hope that vaccines alone would stop the pandemic was mistaken.

- In summary, after a lull in the pandemic, the Delta variant emerges as a new threat, causing cases to rise again in the U.S. The variant demonstrates the ongoing challenges in overcoming COVID-19.

- Robert Stewart, a businessman with no experience, was awarded millions in federal contracts to supply N95 respirator masks to Veterans Affairs hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, he failed to deliver the masks for weeks, putting health care workers and patients at risk.

- The Veterans Health Administration serves 9 million veterans across 1,700 health care facilities. Early in the pandemic, nurses warned of dwindling supplies of masks and other protective equipment, putting them in danger of infection and burnout.

- Stewart leveraged his connections to win the contracts but needed the means or knowledge to fulfill them. He had to rely on overseas distributors to source sometimes subpar masks could have been better.

- The failures and delays with the mask contracts are emblematic of more significant mismanagement, profiteering, and lack of oversight within parts of the federal government's pandemic response. Some companies took advantage of the crisis to increase profits, rather than serve public health needs.

- Taxpayers funded the development of a low-cost ventilator for pandemics, but instead of supplying it for COVID-19, the company sold versions overseas. Lack of coordination and oversight allowed various response elements to descend into dysfunction.

- The summary outlines how a dire health crisis was exacerbated by incompetence and profiteering. Essential supplies did not reach those in need, and a poorly managed response cost lives. Nurses' experiences on the front lines reveal a health system unprepared for a catastrophe of this scale.

The U.S. government has invested billions of dollars in developing vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. However, decades of decisions weakened the systems that were supposed to distribute and administer these medical countermeasures during a crisis.

After 9/11, Congress increased funding for public health preparedness, including the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) of medical supplies. However, during the Obama administration, congressional Republicans sought to cut the deficit by reducing spending on public health. Rep. Denny Rehberg pushed for cuts to the stockpile and other health programs. From 2010 to 2013, the SNS budget was cut by about 10%. Public health experts warned that this could hamper response efforts during a crisis.

The Trump administration proposed even deeper cuts, reducing the SNS budget by about 30% between 2016 and 2019. Experts said this could mean fewer people receiving treatment during an emergency. However, some funding was restored by Congress. Still, when COVID-19 hit, the U.S. struggled to distribute stockpiled supplies. The government had to issue emergency contracts to scale up production and distribution, but many of the companies hired lacked experience, and some committed fraud.

Meatpacking plants also struggled with outbreaks, even as some executives bet on how many workers would get sick. The food supply chain began breaking down, even as billionaires and politically connected companies profited. The government's failures underscore how years of underfunding and poor planning left the U.S. unprepared for a pandemic. Public health experts had long warned about these risks, but policymakers failed to take action.

Here is a summary:

• In February 2020, the Trump administration downplayed the coronavirus's severity, despite experts' warnings. The CDC said the risk to Americans was low, while HHS stalled emergency funding requests and the export of PPE.

• The first known U.S. coronavirus death occurred in early February, though it was not announced until April. The virus was circulating in the U.S. as early as January.

• In late February, the stock market plunged, and the WHO warned of the virus's "pandemic potential." Trump appointed Vice President Pence to lead the coronavirus task force. The U.S. had its first case of community spread.

• On February 29, the first U.S. coronavirus death was announced. The Trump administration claimed the government was increasing PPE and test production, though companies said they had not received requests to do so.

• A study found that the coronavirus mortality rate was ten times that of the flu. As of March 4, the U.S. death toll rose to 9. The virus was spreading rapidly, though the government's response remained slow.

• In summary, the Trump administration was unprepared and failed to act urgently in the early weeks of the outbreak. Their delayed and inadequate response allowed the virus to spread widely, leading to a crisis.

- On March 3, 2020, the Senate Health Committee held a hearing on the coronavirus outbreak. Senator Richard Burr, the committee chairman, warned about the pandemic in private. However, he publicly downplayed the threat and sold off stock before the market declined. Senator Kelly Loeffler also sold millions in stocks following Senate briefings.

- On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the coronavirus a pandemic. The U.S. had severe shortages of tests, masks, and other critical supplies.

- On March 13, 2020, Trump declared a national emergency. However, he said, "I do not take responsibility at all" for the lack of testing.

- On March 16, 2020, the CDC warned against gatherings of 50+ people for eight weeks. However, states had to bid against each other for supplies in a "fumbling and chaotic" process. Trump told governors to "try getting [ventilators] yourselves."

- Jared Kushner's "shadow task force" of inexperienced volunteers hampered the response. They should have acted on leads for critical supplies.

- On March 26, 2020, the U.S. surpassed other countries in coronavirus cases. Jobless claims soared to record highs.

- On March 29, 2020, "Project Airbridge" delivered medical supplies on commercial planes. However, the program was the secretive, exaggerated impact, and favored Trump allies.

- On March 31, 2020, Gov. Cuomo said New York was "flying blind" without federal help and tests. Hogan said Trump's claims about testing were "just not true."

- On April 3, 2020, the administration redefined the national stockpile to match Kushner's false claim that it is not for states. Kushner's claim was a "verifiable lie."

In summary, the federal government needed to respond to warnings. Disorganization and lies hampered the response, while political allies were favored. States were left bidding against each other for life-saving supplies.

Here is a summary:

• Peter Navarro, Trump's trade adviser, aggressively pushed dubious coronavirus contracts with little oversight. He used his influence to award massive deals to companies with political connections but little experience, like Phlow Corporation.

• Navarro and Steven Hatfill, a controversial adviser, pushed for nearly $1 billion in contracts for companies Hatfill consulted for, including Phlow. Phlow, a new company with no experience, hired Hatfill as a consultant to help win government deals.

• The White House took the extraordinary step of pushing FEMA to award its largest contract to AirBoss with no competitive bidding. AirBoss's stock price tripled after the deal was announced. The $96 million contract was among the largest awarded with no bidding during the pandemic.

• A former White House aide, Zach Fuentes, received a $3 million contract to supply masks to Navajo hospitals even though his company was bankrupt. Many of the masks did not meet N95 standards. The VA had denied reports of mask shortages at its hospitals around the same time.

• A ProPublica investigation found several other dubious federal contracts awarded to inexperienced companies, some connected to Trump allies. A medical supply company was operating out of a house, and a $57 million deal went to an arms trader with no experience in personal protective equipment.

• The federal government's massive spending on pandemic relief, with little oversight, led to waste and abuse. Politically connected companies and those willing to pay hefty lobbying fees were often prioritized over more qualified vendors.

- Unproven vendors with little experience sell masks to the U.S. government at high prices during the pandemic. Some vendors make fraudulent claims about the efficacy of their masks.
- An early article on consulting advises consultants to provide value beyond just advice. Some coronavirus mask traders try to profit from government money without providing real value.
- A pharmacist promoted dubious "snake oil" remedies during the 1918 flu pandemic. Similar profiteering is happening today with ineffective or fraudulent treatments for COVID-19.
- In 1918, shortages led to high prices for items like coffins. Today, shortages of PPE have also led to high prices, and governments are desperate to buy equipment, enabling fraud.
- People not wearing masks in public led to violence and deaths during the 1918 flu. The same has happened during COVID-19.
- Federal and local governments disagreed on appropriate responses during 1918, as is happening now between some governors and the federal government.
- Fraudsters made millions quickly by importing cheap masks, price gouging, and making misleading claims to governments. Some needed to gain experience in PPE or the medical field.
- Dr. Rick Bright warned about mask and PPE shortages early in the U.S. outbreak but was ignored and removed from his role. His warnings proved prescient.
- Unusable supplies like mini soda bottles were sold to governments instead of medical equipment like test tubes. Some vendors removed "not for medical use" labels to pass off equipment suitable for hospitals.
- Texas governor Greg Abbott was slow to respond to the outbreak, prioritizing reopening businesses over health measures like mask requirements. His delayed response worsened the impact in Texas.

- Don V. Cisternino allegedly submitted fraudulent PPP loan applications and received $7.2 million. He used the money to buy luxury goods and a mansion. He has been indicted for fraud.

- The PPP program aimed to help small businesses keep employees on payroll during the pandemic. However, the program was riddled with fraud and abuse. Over 120 people have been charged with fraud related to PPP loans.

- The PPP program favored large, wealthy companies over small businesses in minority communities. Banks gave preferential treatment to biggest clients. As a result, the neediest small businesses were often left out.

- Fintech companies like Kabbage processed many PPP loans but often failed to vet the applications properly. Hundreds of loans went to fake farms and fraudulent applicants.

- Some large public companies took PPP loans but laid off thousands of workers anyway. Over $395 billion was distributed through the PPP program, but oversight needed to be improved.

- Lawsuits and public records requests were needed to obtain data on which companies received PPP loans and how much. More transparency was needed in the program.

- The PPP program provided a crucial lifeline for many businesses during the pandemic but was plagued by a lack of oversight, fraud, and unequal access. Reforms are still needed to address the program's transparency and equity issues.

- Moderna was founded in 2010 by scientists who had conducted early research on mRNA vaccines with government funding.

- Two key founders were Derrick Rossi, a stem cell biologist, and Robert Langer, a biomedical engineering professor at MIT. They were inspired by the work of Katalin Karikó, a Hungarian scientist who helped prove mRNA could be used to induce cells to produce proteins.

- Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine delivers mRNA that instructs cells to produce the coronavirus spike protein, then triggers an immune response. The vaccine was developed in partnership with the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

- Although government funding and research laid the groundwork for mRNA vaccines, the Moderna founders and investors have become billionaires from the company's success. Critics argue that taxpayers deserve more benefits from the investments that made the vaccine possible. Supporters counter that the private sector was essential in taking the risk to translate early research into a usable product.

- The key scientists and entrepreneurs built on decades of work to realize the promise of mRNA vaccines, persevering through periods of limited funding and skepticism about the technology. Their breakthrough has been pivotal in the fight against COVID-19.

That covers the essential highlights of Moderna's founding and development, key scientists' rolestists, how mRNA vaccines work, how government funding contributed, and how some founders became billionaires from the company's success. Please let me know if you want me to explain or expand on any summary part.

• More than 80 Brighton Rehab and Wellness Center residents in Beaver, Pennsylvania, died from COVID-19, including 73-year-old David Gill and 400 others. About a third of U.S. COVID-19 deaths have been linked to long-term care facilities like nursing homes.

• Nursing homes are highly profitable businesses. Studies show that private equity ownership of nursing homes is linked to worse health outcomes and quality of care. About 70% of U.S. nursing homes are for-profit, and private equity firms own many.

• A 2020 study found mortality rates were 10% higher in private equity–owned nursing homes before the pandemic. The federal government commissioned the study.

• Brighton Rehab and Wellness Center have been cited multiple times for health and safety violations in recent years. In 2019, inspectors found failures to properly screen staff and residents, and a lack of protective equipment.

• The facility's medical director warned in March 2020 about a lack of PPE and testing. However, the facility used hydroxychloroquine on residents without state approval.

• More than 80 residents at the facility died of COVID-19. The facility's death toll accounted for almost half of Beaver County's COVID-19 deaths.

• Relatives say Brighton Rehab and Wellness Center's handling of the outbreak amounted to neglect and "death pits." The high death toll highlights the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on long-term care facilities and their residents and staff.

That is a high-level summary of the key details and events related to the COVID-19 outbreak at Brighton Rehab and Wellness Center nursing home in Beaver, Pennsylvania.

Here is a summary:

- In April 2020, local officials in Beaver County, Pennsylvania announced that a local ice rink would be prepared as a makeshift morgue in case of a surge in deaths from COVID-19.

- By May 2020, the National Guard had been called in to help at a Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center, a nursing home in Beaver County experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak.

- In November 2020, families of residents who had died at Brighton filed a lawsuit alleging poor care and mismanagement during the outbreak. An investigation found that the owners had cut staff and funding while increasing profits.

- The owners received millions in COVID-19 relief funding. Brighton had one of the worst outbreaks in Pennsylvania, with at least 82 cases and 23 deaths as of November 2020.

- A five-month investigation by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found Brighton's chronic understaffing and poor infection control led to unnecessary suffering and death. The facility's management failed to take basic steps to curb the outbreak.

- The management company that owns Brighton, Comprehensive Healthcare Management Services, has faced similar complaints at other facilities. According to the investigation, the company has used loopholes to maximize profits while providing poor care.

- The situation at Brighton highlights how some nursing home chains were ill-equipped and mismanaged during the pandemic, while also reaping large amounts of COVID-19 funding and other government subsidies. The families affected continue to seek accountability and justice.

Here is a summary of the mentioned terms:

Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES): Provides economic relief to workers, families, and small businesses. Also provides funding for essential health and critical response resources.

Counterfeits: Fake masks, tests, or other medical equipment. Counterfeit masks were sold during COVID-19.

COVID-19: The novel coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019.

Critical Infrastructure and Protection division: A division within ASPR that coordinates infrastructure protection and risk mitigation.

Deaths: Many deaths were due to COVID-19, especially in nursing homes and among minorities—nearly 600,000 total deaths in the U.S. as of July 2021.

Defense Production Act: Gives the federal government authority to require companies to prioritize government contracts and orders necessary for national defense. They are used during COVID-19 to increase supply of critical resources like ventilators, masks, and other PPE.

FDA: The Food and Drug Administration. Responsible for regulating vaccines, drugs, medical devices, and other products. I had to review and approve various COVID-19 treatments, tests, and vaccines.

FEMA: The Federal Emergency Management Agency. Responsible for coordinating government response to disasters and emergencies like COVID-19. Ran programs to procure and distribute masks, tests, ventilators, and other critical supplies.

Fillakit LLC: A company that received large government contracts to provide COVID-19 testing supplies but was found to be producing contaminated and unusable testing kits.

Fintech: Financial technology companies that provide banking and financial services through software and apps. Some fintech companies were involved in distributing PPP loans during COVID-19.

Forgivable loans: Loans, like those in the PPP program, do not need to be repaid if certain conditions are met. The PPP loans could be forgiven if businesses used most of the money to avoid job cuts and economic losses.

Hydroxychloroquine: A drug that some believed could treat COVID-19 though clinical trials found little benefit. The promotion of hydroxychloroquine was tied to various conspiracy theories.

January 6th insurrection: The storming of the U.S. Capitol building by rioters trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The insurrection and promotion of election fraud conspiracies were linked to some of the exact figures who spread COVID-19 misinformation.

Loans: The federal government provided various loan programs, including PPP loans, to help businesses survive economic losses from COVID-19. Some of these loan programs were subject to fraud and abuse.

Lockdowns: The closing of businesses, public spaces, and restrictive policies put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19. Lockdowns were controversial and unevenly followed. Many were lifted as vaccines became widely available.

Nursing homes: Long-term care facilities for elderly and disabled residents. Nursing homes were hit especially hard by COVID-19, with many suffering severe outbreaks and high death tolls in the early months of the pandemic before better policies, testing, PPE were put in place.

PPP: The Paycheck Protection Program provided forgivable loans to small businesses to help them avoid layoffs and closures during COVID-19. The PPP program was subject to fraud and abuse, but it also helped many small businesses survive.

Racial inequalities: Racial minorities suffered disproportionately from health and economic impacts of COVID-19 due to longstanding systemic inequalities. Early data showed higher case and death rates in Black and Hispanic communities.

Stock market: The stock market plunged in March 2020 as COVID-19 spread globally but largely recovered over the following year thanks to colossal stimulus spending, low interest rates, and optimism about vaccines.

Strategic National Stockpile: The U.S. stockpile of critical medical supplies, like masks, ventilators, and PPE. Cuts to the stockpile left the U.S. with inadequate supplies as COVID-19 overwhelmed supply chains worldwide.

Ventilators: Critical medical equipment to help patients breathe when their lungs are unable to function properly due to illness or injury. A shortage of ventilators was a feared scenario early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Production of ventilators was ramped up through programs like the Defense Production Act.

Wealthy: The wealthy in some cases benefited disproportionately from government aid, including through gaps and loopholes in programs like PPP loans that were intended to help small businesses and lower income groups.

- At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., N95 masks and other personal protective equipment were in short supply. The national stockpile needed more.

- CDC guidance initially did not recommend masks for the general public. Later guidance recommended cloth masks, as N95s and surgical masks were prioritized for healthcare workers.

- The government awarded many contracts to ramp up supply, spending billions of dollars. Some deals were scrutinized as potentially wasteful or fraudulent. Intermediaries and brokers made profits reselling masks.

- Counterfeit masks flooded the market, putting people at risk. The FDA took action against some distributors. Home improvement stores and individuals selling masks were also issues.

- Nursing homes faced severe PPE shortages that put residents and staff at risk. Many residents died of COVID-19 before vaccines became available.

- Senator Rick Bright, then head of BARDA, testified before Congress that the U.S. was unprepared for the pandemic and HHS leadership ignored warnings. After raising concerns, he was removed from his position.

- Operation Warp Speed sped the development and distribution of vaccines, with the first (Pfizer) approved in December 2020. However, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation also spread.

- Several people profited by exploiting shortages of PPE and the crisis in general. Questionable intermediaries, scams, price gouging, and fraud were reported. Two examples covered in depth are Robert Stewart Jr., the Federal Government Experts' contract with the V.A., and the VPL Medical deal with New York City.

- ProPublica reporters went into the field to report on the pandemic, sometimes facing risks to inform the public. Their reports covered inequality, profiteering, data on PPP loans, and more.
