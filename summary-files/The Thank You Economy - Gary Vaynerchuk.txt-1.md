 Here's a summary of The Thank You Economy by Gary Vaynerchuk:

- The business world has changed dramatically due to technologies like social media and mobile devices. However, human nature—specifically, people's desire to connect and build relationships—has not changed. 

- Businesses must now work to build strong, trusting relationships with customers at scale. Social media allows companies to have personalized interactions with huge numbers of customers.

- Many smart people and businesses dismiss social media, but they do so at their own peril. Social media is revolutionizing business and communication.

- To succeed in the Thank You Economy, businesses must establish the right culture from the top down. They need to genuinely appreciate customers and make them happy. 

- Businesses should combine traditional media and social media. They must go where their customers are, even if that means constantly adapting to new technologies and platforms.

- Businesses should focus on the quality and intent of their social media interactions, not just the quantity. The interactions should be authentic and build real relationships.

- Some examples of companies succeeding in the Thank You Economy include Avaya, AJ Bombers, Joie de Vivre Hotels, and dentist Irena Vaksman. They provide great customer experiences and build community.

- Sawdust contains additional thoughts on related topics like why women may adapt better to social media and how mobile devices amplify the Thank You Economy. 

- To win in the Thank You Economy, focus on culture, listening to customers, quality over quantity, shock and awe, creating amazing customer experiences, and building community. Adapt to constant change.

That's a high-level summary of the key ideas and examples in Gary Vaynerchuk's The Thank You Economy. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of the summary.

 Here is a summary:

- Social media is a massive cultural shift, not just a new media channel. It has fundamentally changed how society uses the Internet and how businesses need to market to and build relationships with customers. 

- Many business leaders don't recognize this shift and the opportunity social media presents. But there are many examples of companies of all sizes that have used social media to build relationships with customers and improve their bottom line.

- The key to success with social media is exposing your company's "heart and soul" by building real relationships with customers through caring and authentic communication, not just selling to them. People connect with and buy from companies and brands they care about.

- While scaling one-to-one social media relationships takes money and resources, the investment is really in your company culture and turning customers into ambassadors. The goal should be "no interaction left behind."

- The business world today is operating much like it did in our great-grandparents' era, where relationships, caring, and word-of-mouth were key. Businesses need to get back to what worked then to succeed now and in the future. 

- Many elderly people recognize how much the world has improved but miss the way business was done in the past, when local merchants knew their customers personally and cared about them. Social media allows us to get back to that model, even at a huge scale.

- To make the most of this opportunity, companies need to develop strategies that are a "perfect date" between traditional media and social media. They need the right company culture and intentions to truly connect with customers. And they need to deliver an experience that creates "shock and awe."

That covers the key highlights and main takeaways from the summary. Please let me know if you would like me to explain or expand on any part of the summary.

 Here is a summary:

- There is nostalgia for a slower time when communities were tight-knit and businesses cared deeply about customer service. In small towns, everyone knew each other and businesses depended on word-of-mouth and customer loyalty. 
- As people moved to suburbs and exurbs, and big businesses replaced small businesses, customer service declined. Companies prioritized profits over customer experience. Manners and social norms became more relaxed, and companies followed suit, eliminating extras and making customers feel unimportant. 
- New technologies like the Internet, e-commerce, and automated phone systems made it even easier for companies to avoid direct customer service. People could shop and do business entirely online without human contact. Companies exploited websites and automation to seem available 24/7 while actually avoiding most real customer service. 
- Around 2003, social networks brought back some elements of small-town community online. People could connect with friends and neighbors, share information, and exert influence again. Review sites and viral posts allowed people to publicly criticize companies again. 
- Businesses realized they depended on these online communities and opinions. A single viral complaint could reach thousands. They needed to provide good customer service again to nurture loyalty and word-of-mouth promotion. The pendulum is swinging back toward valuing customers and customer experience.

In summary, new technologies enabled a decline in customer service for a time. But the rise of online communities has given more power back to customers. To thrive, businesses must provide good customer service to build loyalty in these communities. The values of an earlier era, when businesses truly cared for customers, are making a comeback.

 Here is a summary:

- Social media has allowed us to stay connected with each other in unprecedented ways. We can share details of our daily lives and form close-knit communities online, much like in small towns of the past.

- Businesses were initially skeptical of social media's usefulness but failed to realize the power of the resurgence of word-of-mouth marketing.  Consumers can now easily share information, opinions, and recommendations with hundreds or even thousands of friends and followers. This magnifies the impact of word-of-mouth exponentially. 

- Word-of-mouth via social media is especially powerful because people tend to trust recommendations from friends and people they know. Companies that don't engage in these online conversations risk losing business and dealing with public relations nightmares.

- Social media gives more power and influence to individual consumers. If a customer has a bad experience with a company and shares it on social media, it can spread rapidly and cause major damage. Companies have to take individual complaints and feedback much more seriously in today's hyperconnected world. 

- An example is cited of a blogger who complained about AT&T's customer service on his blog and received a threatening call from the company. His story spread widely on social media and likely caused AT&T to lose customers and goodwill. This shows how much influence an individual voice can have today thanks to social media.

In summary, the key ideas are that social media has enabled a return to small-town connectedness, amplified the power of word-of-mouth, shifted more influence and control to consumers, and forced companies to be much more responsive to individual feedback and complaints. Businesses that don't adapt to this new reality will struggle.

 Here is a summary:

- Previously, companies could ignore customer complaints and dissatisfaction with little consequence. Now, with the rise of social media, unhappy customers have the power to significantly damage a company’s reputation and bottom line. Companies are using social media primarily to react to and mitigate potential harm, but social media’s greatest potential lies in building brand relationships and equity. 

- Companies need to build authentic relationships with customers, like small town business owners did. They need to take the long view instead of focusing on short-term metrics. They need to show the personalities and values of people at all levels of the company. And they need to shape word of mouth by treating each customer as the most important. This is “the Thank You Economy.”

- Authenticity is key. Companies can’t turn on charm only for big spenders or when handling complaints. They need to value each customer and build real relationships. Even if they lose some customers to competitors, focusing on relationships will win more in the long run. 

- Big companies can build personal relationships at scale, but only if leadership commits to an overhaul of company culture so that all employees engage authentically with customers. When done right, this benefits both customers and companies. 

- Social media gives companies real-time feedback to see what’s working and not working. Companies should be grateful for the opportunity to quickly improve based on customer input. 

- Customer expectations have been raised by companies known for great service and experiences. Exceeding expectations is now mandatory to compete. What used to be considered great service is no longer enough.

- In summary, the key themes are: build authentic relationships at scale, commit to company culture change, use social media for feedback, exceed raised customer expectations, and focus on the long-term benefits of customer loyalty and word-of-mouth marketing. Companies that do this will thrive in the Thank You Economy.

 Here is a summary:

• Online companies rarely send thank you notes to customers, which is why Wufoo, an online form developer, gets a lot of positive attention for randomly sending handwritten thank you notes to long-time customers. 

• Once customers experience superior service or treatment, like flying first class, they come to expect it all the time. Companies need to start providing respect, kindness, and good service to all customers, not just big spenders. Providing great service and building loyalty leads to business growth through word-of-mouth.

• Engaging with customers on social media is essential for business today. It reveals any shortcomings in a company’s product or service so they can be addressed. Successful social media engagement builds one-to-one relationships and word-of-mouth promotion. 

• Companies should respond to all online conversations about them, not just some. If a CEO would address a complaint overheard in person, they should do the same for online comments. Social media allows companies to participate in and spread conversations about them. Ignoring social media means missing opportunities and allowing negative word-of-mouth.

• Entrepreneurs are likely already engaging customers online and offline. CEOs and managers need to implement social media and a “thank you economy” culture to stay competitive. It requires commitment to gradual change. Some CEOs struggle to implement change due to short-term pressures like stock prices, even when it’s best long-term. Better knowledge of customers from social media leads to more tailored marketing and more sales.

• Showing customers you care, like by replacing faulty products and offering discounts, builds loyalty and word-of-mouth promotion. Social media allows this type of interaction and relationship building on a large scale.

The key ideas are that social media and building loyalty by engaging customers with a “thank you economy” culture are essential for business success today. CEOs and companies as a whole must commit to implementing social media and a focus on customer experience to thrive.

 Here's a summary:

- The article argues that CEOs face pressure from Wall Street to stick with old, proven business strategies rather than invest in radical innovation. Wall Street analysts tend to give good ratings to companies pursuing outdated strategies and punish those investing in new technologies. 
- However, some CEOs realize that ignoring Wall Street is necessary to invest in long-term innovation. They take the short-term hit to stock price in hopes of gaining long-term success.
- The author argues companies should start preparing now for changes in consumer culture and expectations that new technologies will bring. Though the metrics to justify social media investment aren't there yet, companies need to build a foundation. 
- Companies can survive without social media but will fall behind competitors embracing new platforms and adapting to changes. Success will come from flexibility and understanding shifting customer expectations, not any one platform. 
- Using social media correctly leads to more loyal customers, increased word-of-mouth, and customer advocacy. This helps companies succeed in an economy based on customer relationships and appreciation.
- The example of Zagat shows how failing to anticipate changes and adapt to innovation allowed competitors like Yelp to cut into market share. Though Zagat has since fought back, the story illustrates the importance of monitoring shifts in customer expectations and desires. 
- The author argues "social media = business." Though social media enabled the customer revolution, the real changes run deeper. Businesses must adapt marketing to new platforms transforming culture and society. Though traditional models still have a place, companies can't afford to miss the opportunities new technologies offer. 
- The next wave of innovation will offer more changes and opportunities for companies flexible enough to catch the train. Social media is here to stay, though something new will eventually emerge.

In summary, the key argument seems to be that companies need to build flexibility and anticipation into their models. Though sticking with tried-and-true strategies may please Wall Street, failure to adapt to cultural and technological changes risks allowing competitors to pass them by. monitoring the horizon for shifts in customer expectations and desires, then adjusting models to take advantage of new opportunities, is key to success. Social media is transforming business, and companies can't afford to miss the train.

 Here is a summary:

- In 1997, the author was invited to speak at a conference about selling wine online. The speaker before him dismissed the idea that ecommerce would take off. The author disagreed but the audience was skeptical. 

- Entrepreneurs often sense major changes before others. Jeff Bezos anticipated the potential of the Internet for retail. The author sensed the potential for selling wine online.

- Most people are resistant to change and new technologies. For example, many people were originally skeptical of cell phones and Facebook but now widely use them. There is a divide between those who eagerly adopt new technologies and the majority.

- Companies often cling to numbers and measurable data and are slow to adopt new technologies like social media. They draw “lines in the sand” to distance themselves from the unknown. But ignoring threats does not make them disappear. While the impact may not be immediate, the risk to the business grows over time.

- Examples are given of companies that failed to anticipate major shifts, like horse-and-buggy businesses that didn’t switch to automobiles quickly enough or book retailers that didn’t fully anticipate the threat from Amazon. Although the demise wasn’t immediate, they eventually suffered or went out of business.

- Big, established companies have the means to compete with upstart competitors but often fail to make a full-fledged effort. The author argues Barnes & Noble could have combatted Amazon more aggressively but didn’t.

- Social media is currently like having only one kidney - you can survive with just one but are better off with two. But social media will eventually become as vital to business as the phone is. Businesses must adopt social media or risk becoming obsolete.

The key message is that companies tend to be slow to adopt new technologies and ways of doing business. But failing to anticipate and adapt to major shifts like social media, even if the negative impacts are not immediate, puts businesses at serious risk of decline or failure. The companies that survive and thrive are those that are willing to embrace change.

 Here is a summary:

There are many excuses companies use to avoid investing in social media, but a lack of ROI is a major one. However, social media engagement and building customer relationships absolutely provide ROI. 

Advocates, or highly engaged and loyal customers, provide significant ROI. They spend more, stay longer, and provide free marketing. Social media allows companies to turn casual customers into advocates.

Even for non-advocates, superior customer experience and service provide ROI. Customers will pay more for good service and experience. Engaging with customers one-on-one through social media provides that superior experience.

Statistics show the ROI of customer service and experience:

- 40% of customers will switch to a competitor because of their reputation for customer service. 
- 55% of customers recommend a company primarily because of great service.
- 66% of customers will pay 5-25% more to ensure a good customer experience.
- 76% of customers appreciate when companies show personal interest in them.

So in summary, social media and building customer relationships are as important to a business as a strong heart. They provide the lifeblood of loyalty, word-of-mouth marketing, and revenue. The ROI is clear and significant for any business willing to sincerely engage with their customers.

 Here is a summary:

The key to greater customer spending is superior customer service.  Providing great customer service, especially through one-to-one social media engagement, creates customer advocates and loyalty.  While some executives are hesitant to invest in social media due to concerns over unreliable metrics, social media metrics and tools are becoming increasingly sophisticated.  Engagement data provides valuable insight into customer needs and perceptions.  Though social media is a young platform, first-mover advantage matters.  Companies that build social media relationships and trust early will have a significant competitive edge.  Social media relationships, like personal relationships, take time and emotional investment to develop.  The longer companies wait, the harder and more expensive it will be to build meaningful social media engagement.

 Here's a summary:

1. Social media is a powerful tool for building relationships and connecting with customers. It allows for authentic interactions that can lead to loyal fans and advocates. 

2. You can't buy someone else's fans or social media following. Those relationships are built on trust and shared experiences. Taking over another brand's social media profiles won't translate into gaining their followers.

3. The key to building a social media following is to provide value, engage authentically, listen to your audience, and build real relationships. It takes patience and persistence, but will pay off in gaining loyal customers and advocates.

4. Social media is not just a passing trend. While specific platforms may come and go, the overall shift to more direct communication and relationships with customers is here to stay. Brands need to adapt to new ways of engaging with customers.

5. You can't control your message on social media. The key is to listen to your audience and address issues and complaints sincerely and transparently. Trying to control negative comments often backfires, while responsiveness and customer service can turn critics into loyal fans.

The main takeaways are that social media has fundamentally changed the relationship between brands and customers. It allows for more direct and personal interactions that build real relationships and loyalty. While the specific tools and platforms may change, social media and these new dynamics of customer relationships are here to stay. The brands that embrace social media and build authentic connections will thrive.

 Here is a summary:

• Companies can personalize messages to customers on platforms like YouTube for free. This allows for a customized, personal message that traditional media cannot achieve. 

• Most problems companies face can be fixed unless they are doing something fundamentally wrong like using child labor. Even major disasters like oil spills can be overcome if companies properly manage the response. Companies often underestimate customers’ willingness to forgive and their ability to detect insincerity.

• The best thing companies can do is be honest and transparent. They should allow negative comments on social media and address them. Unhappy customers who don’t complain are the biggest threat. Companies should give customers what they want but don’t have to give in to every demand. They can explain their reasoning while taking the high road.

• Companies are often too fearful of letting employees use social media freely. But this gives insight into the company culture and hiring decisions. Smart, thoughtful posts, whether positive or negative, provide value. Problem employees will also reveal themselves. 

• All customers matter now, not just big spenders. Companies must make engaging with customers a priority like having a website. At first, small companies will need to do this themselves but can eventually delegate to a social media team. Larger companies likely have resources they are wasting that can be re-allocated to social media engagement.

• In summary, being transparent, addressing issues, and engaging with all customers on their terms are keys to success today. This requires a shift in thinking for many companies but the rewards of stronger customer relationships and brand loyalty are worth it.

 Here is a summary:

The author argues that companies should establish a separate Social Media department to focus on interacting with customers. This department should be efficient and lean, and any employees not fully dedicated should be replaced. Meetings and bureaucracy should be minimized so that time can be spent engaging with customers.

The author then addresses 10 common arguments against social media and counters each one:

1. We’re doing fine without it. The author argues this is complacent thinking and companies need to listen to customers to stay competitive. 

2. Social media is just hype. The author says social media is a long-term investment and companies need to be patient to see results.

3. We tried it; it doesn’t work. The author says most companies give up too quickly. Social media requires long-term commitment and strategy.

4. The legal issues are too thorny. The author says company leadership needs to push the legal department to find ways to make social media work, even in heavily regulated industries. They need to take calculated risks.

5. It takes too long to pay off. The author acknowledges this can be true but says social media, when done right, can provide ongoing benefits at little cost. Companies need to be patient and also diversify their marketing.

In summary, the author argues that companies should make the investment in social media, be patient and committed, work to overcome obstacles, and view it as a long-term strategy that can provide substantial benefits. With the right approach, social media can be an extremely effective tool, even for companies in regulated industries. But leadership and patience are required.

 Here is a summary:

• The speaker believes the Zappos acquisition showed that culture and customer relationships are increasingly valuable. Numbers alone do not tell the whole story. 

• Customer obsession is key to success in the Thank You Economy, but it starts with employee obsession. Leaders must foster a caring culture that cascades through the whole company.

• To build a caring culture and have employees who provide great service, leaders must:

1. Treat employees like adults and give them autonomy. 

2. Engage with employees one-on-one to meet their individual needs.

• While perks are nice, what really makes employees happy and loyal is being treated like adults and having their individual needs met. 

• Leaders can apply Thank You Economy principles internally to build a caring culture, just as they do externally with customers.

• An example is providing opportunities for employees to connect one-on-one with leadership to share feedback and feel heard. This helps build trust and loyalty.

• When leaders show they care about employees, employees will in turn care deeply about customers and company success. But leaders must model the behavior they want to see.

 Here is a summary:

• The company has an unlimited vacation policy. Employees can take as much or as little vacation as they want as long as they get their work done. 

• At first, the policy was confusing for employees. But once they realized the CEO was serious, they took advantage of it. Some took a lot of vacation; others took none. It depends on each person's needs and situation.

• The CEO cares more about his employees than customers or the company. He sees frequent communication and knowing employees' needs as key to their success and retention. However, as the company has grown, it has been harder for him to give the same level of attention to each employee. 

• To build a "Thank You Economy" culture focused on employees, the CEO recommends:

1. Know yourself. Build on your existing qualities rather than trying to change them. Authenticity is key.

2. Commit fully to the vision. Have unwavering determination to create a culture where people "care their face off." Look for ways to fund new initiatives by cutting existing costs.

3. Set the right tone. Leaders should communicate the vision clearly and model the expected behaviors themselves through social media and in-person interactions. 

• The CEO of Boloco burritos has done this well. He provides good benefits and learning opportunities for employees. He also monitors social media for customer feedback and takes action, like asking a store to turn down loud music. This level of care and responsiveness builds loyalty and word-of-mouth marketing.

• Building this kind of culture in large companies requires significant effort to connect with many employees. But with the right building blocks in place, including committed leadership, clear communication, and a focus on authenticity, it is possible. Some companies like Zappos and Best Buy have made progress. The CEO predicts more companies will add roles like Chief Culture Officer to focus on employees' needs and the company culture.

 Here is a summary:

The dollar amount of earned media that Boloco gained through one great act of customer service was likely substantial. The fact that Gary Hirshberg mentioned this story in his book Stirring It Up suggests that many people had read about John Pepper’s letter. 

Pepper’s personal, honest and accommodating tone in his letter to the disappointed customer resonated with readers. Rather than using stiff corporate language, Pepper mentioned his own wife, explained Boloco’s practical concerns while also expressing a desire to win back the customer’s business. He offered the customer free burritos to try other menu options. 

This type of caring, authentic communication helps to build brand loyalty and word-of-mouth marketing. Readers who were moved by Pepper’s sincerity likely spread the story to others and continued to buy from Boloco because they knew “they care about my business.”

The takeaway is that business leaders should invest in open, genuine communication with both customers and employees. Talk to people as human beings, not as numbers or names on a spreadsheet. Build a culture where people are free to share ideas, ask for what they need, and are rewarded for taking risks. While ambitious employees may ultimately leave for new opportunities, a reputation for truly valuing staff will continue to attract top talent. 

Trusting your employees and giving them more freedom and autonomy makes it possible to provide the kind of meaningful customer experiences that resonate in today’s world. Let employees blog, tweet and be their authentic selves. Pay attention to their online expressions and use them as another window into their job performance and job satisfaction. Address any issues to build a motivated, loyal team. With the right people and the right culture, businesses can thrive in the new Thank You Economy.

 Here is a summary:

- The employee should know you understand why they tweeted what they did, even if it was unacceptable. Have an open conversation to figure out the underlying reasons and determine how to prevent it from happening again. 

- It’s better for companies to be open instead of fearful of social media. If you create the right internal culture and hire good employees, there shouldn’t be issues with them using social media. While there is some risk, there is little an employee can say to truly hurt the company if you respond well. A sincere apology and fix can overcome almost any social media crisis.

- Best Buy suspended an employee for creating an amusing video criticizing the iPhone. Their overreaction caused negative press and hurt their image with tech-savvy customers. They should have been more understanding and not reacted out of fear. 

- Be authentic and humble like Jim Joyce, the umpire who admitted his mistake in blowing a perfect game. His sincerity and remorse turned public opinion in his favor. People can sense inauthenticity, so focus on building real relationships.

- In the “Thank You Economy,” big companies should empower all employees to provide great customer service, not just a social media team. Even small interactions, like acknowledging a customer enjoying your product, can have a big impact. While giving away free product may seem risky, you can test the strategy with small budgets for each employee and track the impact and ROI. The risks of negative perception can be mitigated by not being sneaky and providing real value. The long-term benefits to customer relationships and loyalty outweigh the costs.

The key lessons are: be open and authentic, sincerely build relationships, empower your whole team to connect with customers, and don’t fear social media or giving away product if done right. A customer-centric culture where all employees personally care about the customer experience is critical. Mistakes will happen, so focus on handling them well.

 Here's a summary:

The author argues that traditional media and social media can complement each other well for marketing. He gives a couple of examples:

1) He advertised his own book Crush It! using billboards and taxi tops in New York to reach people who may not be on social media. Even though social media is more effective, traditional media still has some cachet and can drive results. The key is negotiating good deals by building relationships and truly caring about the results. 

2) Denny's ran Super Bowl ads to promote a free Grand Slam event but missed an opportunity to extend the conversation on social media. They could have asked people to like their Facebook page to get an additional coupon. This would have allowed them to build relationships and gain customer data to use for future marketing. 

3) Reebok ran a TV ad featuring hockey players Sidney Crosby and Maxime Talbot to promote training shirts. But the ad abruptly ended without showing who won their competition, forcing viewers to go to Reebok's Facebook page to find out. This effectively drew fans into engaging more with the brand on social media.

The key point is that brands shouldn't rely exclusively on either traditional or social media. By combining them, they can start conversations, build relationships, and gain valuable customer data. The platforms can work together for more effective, tailored marketing. But brands have to be willing to reallocate budgets to make the most of new opportunities in social media.

In summary, the perfect date is when traditional media and social media meet and work together. They can complement each other to take marketing to the next level. But brands have to be open to new platforms and willing to negotiate the best ways to combine them.

 Here’s a summary:

Reebok followed low-branded content by remarketing to their Facebook fans, extending their reach. They gained tens of thousands of new followers and the ability to reach millions. 

Old Spice created compelling ads and content that resonated emotionally, then moved the conversation to social media. They asked fans questions on Twitter and Facebook and responded with personalized videos, gaining media coverage and millions of YouTube views. Though sales increased, some question how much was due to social media versus coupons. However, they gained data on and access to 160,000 new potential customers at no cost.

Though big brands have advantages, any brand can leverage social media for one-on-one engagement with creativity and caring. Old Spice provided a model of playing ping-pong between traditional and social media to extend a story. They started with TV ads, then went to social media, then YouTube, gaining media coverage, and back to social media.

However, Old Spice missed an opportunity. Though they gained 120,000 Twitter followers, they didn’t seem to use this data and access for long-term engagement and brand building. Within a month, their Twitter engagement dropped 95% and never recovered. They didn’t continue the conversation or provide value to followers, showing the importance of long-term relationships and not just short campaigns.

So in summary, the key lessons are:

1) Use traditional and social media together for the best results. 
2) Focus on quality, engaging content and conversations, not just numbers. 
3) Build real, lasting relationships with fans and followers, not just short campaigns. 
4) Leverage data and access gained to continue providing value over the long run.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key points and lessons around the Reebok and Old Spice examples? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand the summary in any way.

 Here is a summary:

The key to success in the Thank You Economy is having good intent. Good intent creates pull and draws people to you. In the age of transparency brought about by social media, consumers can now easily spot bad intent and hidden agendas. They can also recognize and reward good intent.

Most social media campaigns fail because they are focused on getting clicks, likes or follows rather than building real connections. While increasing your numbers may seem impressive, it does not gain you anything of real value if you did not put out anything valuable. Large numbers just show you have made contacts, not connections. Successful social media campaigns tap into emotions to create connections and word-of-mouth sharing. They let consumers decide to engage rather than forcing it.

The same good intent behind successful campaigns should be behind day-to-day social media engagement. The intent should be to both nurture current relationships by providing value and to make new connections. The key is to engage personally and meaningfully, not just increase your numbers. Provide real value to build trust and loyalty.

Be authentic and transparent. Admit mistakes. Respond to all comments and questions. Make real connections by engaging on a personal level. Say thank you and show gratitude. Provide exclusives and surprises. These kinds of meaningful engagements are how to build real long-term relationships, not just get more followers.

In summary, success in the Thank You Economy depends on quality over quantity. The key is having good intent to build real relationships and make meaningful connections. Provide real value and engage personally to create true fans and brand advocates. Ultimately, good intent and nurturing relationships will lead to greater success and brand loyalty.

 Here is a summary:

- To strengthen connections with customers, companies should engage with them emotionally and authentically. This means responding promptly to all customer comments, joining conversations, solving problems, and thanking customers when appropriate. 
- In addition to consistent engagement, companies should implement "big things"—major initiatives that significantly impact customers in a positive way. Big things don’t necessarily require huge budgets and can be done by companies of any size. 
- An example of a big thing is when the rapper 50 Cent flew a teenage YouTube user to New York City after the teen posted a video criticizing 50 Cent. 50 Cent then posted a video of the two of them together, turning the criticism into an opportunity to connect with fans. 
- Other examples of big things include:

- Providing outstanding customer service by doing things like offering extraordinary products, experiences or value. For example, a high-end restaurant may offer a special kids menu and activities.

- Solving a customer frustration in an innovative way. For example, a car wash providing free Wi-Fi so customers can be productive while waiting. 

- Creating memorable, shareable experiences. For example, customizing products or services to surprise and delight customers in over-the-top ways. 

- Forming partnerships or endorsements with other brands that genuinely match customers' interests. For example, a snack brand partnering with entertainment properties that customers are passionate about.

- Taking a stand on social issues that customers care about or participating in causes they support. But only if the company is willing to take real action. Empty PR stunts will backfire.

- Running contests, challenges or sweepstakes that genuinely excite customers and fit with the company's brand. But again, the initiatives must be authentic and meaningful, not just self-serving.

The key is that big things should create lasting positive feelings that keep customers talking about and connecting with the brand. When done right, they lead to a groundswell of goodwill, word-of-mouth and brand loyalty. But companies must avoid one-off PR stunts in favor of sustained, multifaceted campaigns to emotionally impact their customers. The little things matter, but big things can truly shock and awe.

 Here is a summary:

- 50 Cent invited a young Canadian fan with cancer to his show, granting his wish and generating good publicity. By engaging with fans, celebrities can humanize themselves and generate goodwill. 
- Companies can also benefit from randomly engaging with and surprising loyal customers. Though expensive, it can generate earned media, word-of-mouth marketing, and long term loyalty. 
- Shock and awe campaigns that provide amazing customer experiences can generate buzz and media attention. Though initially expensive, they provide more value than traditional ads. As technology progresses, companies will need to adjust how they implement shock and awe to continue being effective. 
- Avaya provides business communications technology like voice mail, phones, and routers. Though not inherently exciting, Avaya aims to engage customers through social media by meeting them where they are and providing value. 
- Avaya leverages Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and an online community to connect with different audiences. On Twitter, they share industry news and engage with customers. On Facebook, they post about Avaya's culture and products. On LinkedIn, they network and discuss trends. Their online community provides peer support.
- Avaya also hosts live video chats, partners with customers on videos and blog posts, and sponsors social media events. They aim to provide value to customers through education and building personal relationships. 
- Social media has allowed Avaya to change perceptions by showcasing their culture and connecting on a human level. Though B2B, they focus on sparking conversations rather than just promoting products. This genuine engagement has built trust and loyalty.

 Here is a summary:

Avaya, a leading business communications company, has proven that B2B companies can be successful on social media. By engaging with customers on Twitter, Avaya provides quick and responsive customer service. This has helped the company retain customers, avoid losing revenue, and even gain new business. 

Avaya’s success comes from:

1. Showing up. Avaya actively monitors and engages with customers on social media. This allows them to connect with customers, build relationships, and even gain new business, like the $250,000 deal they won by responding to a tweet. 

2. Being first. By adopting social media early, Avaya established itself as an innovative, forward-thinking company. This boosts their brand and makes them appealing to customers.

3. Remembering that B2B customers are people too. Behind every B2B transaction is a person. Avaya provides great service by treating all customers, whether B2B or B2C, as individuals with needs. Every interaction and relationship has value.

4. Emphasizing customer service. Avaya’s goal on social media is to provide good customer service by answering questions, addressing complaints, and solving problems. This focus on service has been recognized and rewarded.

In summary, Avaya proves that B2B companies can succeed on social media by showing up, emphasizing customer service, treating all customers as individuals, and being an early adopter. With this approach, social media can be a valuable tool for B2B companies to build their brand, retain customers, and gain new business.

 Here's a summary:

• AJ Bombers is a restaurant in Milwaukee owned by Joe and Angie Sorge. They have built a successful business by openly communicating with customers and building a community.

• When their main grill broke down on a Friday lunch rush, instead of hiding it they livestreamed the problem and solution. They gave out free peanuts and beer. This openness built goodwill and loyalty. 

• For the first 6 months, the restaurant just broke even. To improve, they ramped up social media engagement, especially on Twitter and Foursquare. They offered incentives for check-ins and made the “mayor” of the restaurant on Foursquare a free burger. This brought in repeat customers.

• They held special events, like a Foursquare “swarm” event that doubled their Sunday revenue. They rallied customers to get the Travel Channel’s Food Wars to feature them. This national exposure was hugely valuable.

• Keys to their success: 
1) They speak their customers’ language, using social media. This allows them to reach more people at a lower cost.
2) They try new things, like focusing on Foursquare before it had mass adoption. The early adopters helped spread the word.
3) They reward the right people - their loyal customers, not traditional advertising platforms. They spend money on customer events rather than ads. This builds loyalty and goodwill.

• While they give away a lot for free, they have found that it builds a base of dedicated customers who frequent the restaurant and recommend it to others. For example, publicizing one burger on their website led to a 30% increase in sales of that burger. 

• Online gaming and rewards have become part of people’s identities. AJ Bombers was able to tap into this by making becoming “mayor” of their Foursquare page into an ongoing game and sign of status. This keeps people coming back.

• In summary, AJ Bombers has built a successful business through open communication, community building, and rewarding their loyal customers. While giving things away for free, they have found ways to turn this into a sustainable business model.

 Here is a summary:

• Joie de Vivre Hotels is a boutique hotel chain in California that focuses on providing personalized and memorable experiences for its guests. 

• They have an initiative called the DreamMaker program that encourages employees to create unique experiences for guests based on information collected at booking. Examples include surprising a mother staying frequently at a hotel to care for her ill son with a gift basket, or creating a customized scavenger hunt and hotel room decoration for a bachelorette party.

• These personalized experiences generate a lot of word-of-mouth marketing and social sharing for the hotels. Stories of these memorable experiences are likely shared on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, blogs, and in the media.

• Joie de Vivre also focuses on social media engagement and responding to customers on platforms like Yelp, Twitter, Facebook, and Yahoo Travel. They have a dedicated social media team as well as Social Media Champions at each hotel. 

• They use tools like Revinate to monitor online reviews and social media, and pay close attention to TripAdvisor ratings, where two-thirds of their hotels are ranked in the top ten for their area.

• They provide social media training for interested employees to help maximize their social reach and engagement.

• Their marketing budget relies heavily on generating word-of-mouth, which they call “word of mouse.” Memorable experiences and social media engagement are key parts of their marketing strategy.

• They have an online matchmaking service called Yvette to match travelers to the hotel that best fits their personality and interests based on a short questionnaire. Yvette also provides recommendations from locals, including the company founder, to provide an authentic experience. 

• The company culture is highly focused on personalization, customization, and bringing “the joy of life” to customers. This permeates all areas of the guest experience and company operations.

 Here is a summary:

1. The marketing landscape is constantly changing and unstable. Social media and technological innovations have made marketing much more challenging. The only way for brands and businesses to adapt is to conduct personalized outreach to win over customers. This is difficult but impactful work. 

2. Companies must fully commit to the principles of the Thank You Economy, reallocate marketing resources properly, and leverage both social media and traditional media. By doing so, they will see a good return on investment.

3. The marketing changes are not slowing down anytime soon. Marketers must be willing to hustle and put in the work required. Success will come from pursuing many small victories over time through hard work and patience. 

4. Consumer expectations are changing. Businesses need to get creative and personal to meet them. They must innovate continuously to survive. Using social media to talk to customers provides free focus group insights to help businesses stay ahead of trends.

5. Businesses need to incorporate the values of the Thank You Economy and focus on the lifetime value of customers. The ability to build emotional connections and understand customers' networks will become increasingly important. Investing in customers, not platforms, will yield the best returns.

 Here is a summary:

Brands need to start conversations to engage their audience. Big brands with an existing audience can address conversations directly while smaller brands need to start more general conversations to build awareness. Word of mouth has more power than advertising because people trust recommendations from friends and family over random ads. 

Many big companies are afraid to innovate due to fear of failure and focus on short-term gains. Smaller companies are often more passionate and willing to take risks. There are also many people who want to limit the use of social media by brands to protect their own business interests. Social media metrics can be as useful as traditional media metrics.

Marketing strategies have parallels with military strategies. Older strategies relied on overwhelming force, like TV ads and radio. Newer strategies require building trust and targeting specific audiences, like engaging on social media and with influencers. Big, broad approaches don’t work for local or targeted marketing. Brands need to change their strategies to match the new environment, just as militaries have adapted to different types of warfare.

In summary, brands must overcome fear of change and distrust in new metrics to have successful marketing strategies today. They need to start conversations, build trust, target local and specific audiences, and be willing to innovate. The old ways of big, broad marketing are outdated. Brands that adapt will succeed while those that don’t will be left behind.

 Here is a summary:

The author spent $44 million primarily on traditional media like TV commercials, billboards, and radio ads. However, the author defends the use of social media and new technology throughout his career despite facing skepticism. He argues that social media builds emotional connections and relationships with customers that lead to higher long term value. 

In contrast, the author criticizes the traditional Nielsen TV ratings system as inaccurate and outdated. He also argues that corporate incentives often reward short-term thinking rather than long-term value creation. The author sees traditional media as lacking in creativity and as overpriced relative to their actual reach and influence. Although the author likes TV and other traditional media, he believes they need to adapt to changes in technology and audience behavior.

The author argues that most consumer surveys and comment cards provide filtered rather than authentic feedback. In contrast, social media provides unfiltered conversations, reactions and opinions from customers. Finally, the author argues against the view that "most brands are still irrelevant on Twitter" and sees social media as crucial for modern brands.

In summary, the author is a proponent of social media and new technology for building brand relationships and value. He believes traditional media and corporate practices need to adapt to changes in the media landscape and customer behavior. The author sees social media as providing unique insights and connections with customers that traditional methods lack.

 Here are the key points summarized:

1. The article identifies the real problem - most brands are not using Twitter correctly. They are using it as a broadcast medium rather than engaging in conversations.Only 12% of their messages are directed at individual users. Successful brands like Dell, Starbucks engage with their followers. 

2. It's the brands' fault that they only engage 18% of the time. They are not using the platform properly.

3. Twitter is still new, only 4 years old. Brands should give it more time to mature before dismissing it.

4. Don't have to be an expert but at least make an effort. Put on a bathing suit and get in the pool. 

5. Jeff Bezos missed an opportunity by not acquiring Woot.com earlier. The one item per day model was obvious. The author was disappointed in himself for not acting on the idea. 

6. Apologizing sincerely can be effective. LeBron James should have apologized on live TV to Cleveland fans for how he announced his departure. His apology would need to be genuine to be accepted.

7. Teamwork and culture are very important. The author has fired very talented employees who could not work well with others.

8. Bill Parcells is a great leader because he turned losing teams into winners by building morale, hiring the right people and establishing the right culture. Leaders today need to understand culture like he did.

9. Companies that don't adapt to the Thank You Economy will lose talent. Frustrated employees will leave for better opportunities. Someday those companies will need those leaders and talents they lost.

10. Business and culture are linked. Understand the culture to understand the business. Capitalism adapts, communism doesn't. 

11. Tony Hsieh's letter to Zappos staff shows how to communicate in the Thank You Economy. He was personal, transparent and focused on culture and values to reassure employees about the Amazon acquisition.

 Here's a summary:

- The CEO's letter announcing the Zappos acquisition by Amazon was very personal, compassionate and reassuring to employees. It conveyed good intent and helped gain employee trust. 

- Companies should take creative risks. Even if unsuccessful, it benefits company culture by showing a willingness to innovate. Talented people are attracted to innovative companies.

- Companies should choose capable community managers, not whoever is available. They require intelligence, empathy and flexibility to succeed.

- Surprising crossovers between social and traditional media personalities or platforms can go viral. For example, popular YouTube stars appearing on TV or in ads. Each medium promotes the other.

- Social media boosts traditional media viewership. People see friends tweeting or posting about events like the Grammys, so they tune in. In the past, people could only call a few friends; now they can alert their whole network with one click.

- There is a false perception that traditional media is effective but social media is not. In reality, social media spreads information about and increases interest in traditional media. They work together.

The key ideas are that companies should value culture, innovation and capable community management. Social and traditional media are interdependent, not independent, and work best when combined. A willingness to take creative risks and build personal connections with employees and customers is vital.

 Here is a summary:

Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Farmville have a significant influence on consumers' purchasing decisions and brand preferences. As much as 28% of online buying decisions are influenced by Facebook and Twitter according to one survey. 

Customer service was notoriously poor in the 1980s and 1990s. It was difficult for consumers to contact companies by phone and they were often subjected to long wait times, convoluted phone menus, and unhelpful service representatives.

Facebook has over 500 million active users. Twitter has over 175 million registered users, though the growth rate has slowed in recent years.

Many large companies have been slow to adapt to and effectively utilize social media. They tend to focus their efforts and budgets on major platforms like Facebook while ignoring smaller niche platforms that could also be useful for engaging their target audiences. These companies often outsource their social media activities rather than developing in-house expertise.

In order to succeed in the modern business landscape, companies must provide both what consumers need (products, services) and what they want (personalized experiences, compassion, community). Brands should aim to elicit an emotional reaction and build a sense of community. They must be authentic, empower employees, and allow customers to help shape the brand. However, the business must maintain control over the overall direction.  Tactics should be used judiciously and mainly to remind consumers why they should care about the brand.

Small companies should act big while big companies act small. Slow growth and progress is better than no progress at all. There is a human behind every business transaction. Companies must understand their customers' language and priorities.

In summary, showing customers you genuinely care, adapting quickly to changes, empowering employees, using social media with good intent, creating community, and balancing consumer input with business control are keys to success in today's marketplace.

 Here is a summary:

• Twitter's user growth rate declined from 13% in March 2009 to 3.5% in October 2009. Despite slowing growth, Twitter reached over 75 million users by May 2010.

• Old Spice's viral "Man Your Man Could Smell Like" campaign drove a 107% increase in body wash sales. However, such viral success is hard to replicate and sales growth was temporary.

• Email open and click through rates are declining due to more competition for attention. Advertisers have had to adapt to lower response rates. 

• Banner ad response rates have also declined dramatically. CTRs were once over 70% but now average less than 1%. Social media and online video are alternatives.

• Restaurants have high failure rates, so social media marketing and promotions are opportunities for exposure and sales. A Foursquare "swarm" event increased one restaurant's sales 110%. Customer experience is also key.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

• According to a 2009 Pew Research Center report, 61% of Americans look online for health information. There is a growing trend of people turning to online sources for information on health and wellness.

• Loïc Le Meur, a social media influencer, questioned whether professionals like dentists need a strong social media presence. His blog post on this topic gained traction and was picked up by TechCrunch.

Nielsen is now tracking how people use internet-connected devices while watching TV to get a more accurate sense of multi-screen behavior.

• In the early days of television, ratings were dominated by C.E. Hooper and Nielsen. Producers would ask “How’s your Hooper?” to determine a show’s popularity. Today, ratings are more complex with many new measurement firms emerging.  

• Many brands still struggle to leverage Twitter and social media effectively. A study found most brands fail to engage audiences and provide relevant content on social media.

• Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh sent a letter to shareholders in 2009 defending the company’s use of Twitter to build customer relationships and brand loyalty. He argued that Zappos’ approach to customer service and social media would provide long-term benefits.

• The 2010 Grammys saw a 35% increase in viewership due in large part to social media buzz and live tweeting during the event. The Grammys were able to tap into the prevalence of second-screen behavior and drive ratings.

• Thanks to ghostwriter Stephanie Land and others for their help in synthesizing and articulating these key points.

 Here is a summary:

- Focus on emerging influencers and micro-celebrities on social media rather than getting overwhelmed by problems. Social media requires a dedicated team. 

- Many companies use social media poorly, just broadcasting messages. A study shows this is common in both the US and UK.

- The author includes an example letter in the appendix to illustrate a point.  

- The Old Spice campaign increased the brand's Twitter followers by 5400% and attracted lots of attention, though it will be harder for companies to achieve this in the future. The campaign made the author more likely to buy Old Spice.

- Avaya generated $250K in revenue from listening to customers on social media. Restaurants need a good Yelp strategy to stay in business. 

- Using good manners on social media is a simple way to impress others. 

- The amount of data created every day is enormous, equivalent to everything created up to 2003. Studies based on small samples may be questionable.

- The key points are that companies need to focus on key influencers, use social media properly by engaging rather than just broadcasting, the Avaya and Old Spice examples show the power of social media, and data growth and sampling issues are important to consider. Listening to customers and using good etiquette matter.
