 Here is a summary of the ebook:

- The ebook combines Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) with Law of Attraction principles to help readers attract more abundance into their lives. 

- EFT is a form of psychological acupressure that uses gentle tapping on acupuncture points to balance energy in the body. It is based on ancient Chinese medicine and helps clear emotional and physical blocks.

- The ebook provides EFT tapping sequences, scripts, and Law of Attraction techniques and wisdom to help readers lower resistance and raise the vibration to attract abundance.

- The author, Carol Look, struggled for years to attract financial abundance before learning how to combine EFT and the Law of Attraction. She has since enjoyed great success and wants to teach others how to do the same.

- Each chapter focuses on an abundance-related topic and provides stories, Law of Attraction suggestions, and EFT tapping sequences to help clear abundance blocks. Readers can follow along in order or choose issues as needed.

- EFT helps release challenges like fear of success, anxiety, relationship issues, trauma, etc. When used correctly, it leads to balance in the body and mind, allowing the body's natural healing abilities to resume. However, EFT is not a cure-all.  

- The ebook was created in response to requests from readers of the author's weekly newsletters who wanted her advice on combining EFT and the Law of Attraction in one place.

 

- EFT is a self-help technique that uses tapping on acupuncture points to help relieve emotional distress and physical pain. 

- EFT is not a replacement for professional medical or mental health treatment. It should be used responsibly and ethically.

- To use EFT, you choose a target (emotion, belief, event), rate its intensity on a 0-10 scale, state a setup phrase while tapping the karate chop point, do a negative tapping round focusing on the problem, then a positive tapping round focusing on the solution or desired state.

- The tapping points are: eyebrow, side of the Eye, under the Eye, nose, chin, collarbone, under Arm, and top of the head.

- Telling the story technique involves tapping continuously while describing an emotional event. This helps neutralize the emotional charge.  

- Sample EFT exercise:

Target: I feel worried about all my expenses. 
Intensity: 6/10
Setup: Even though I feel worried about all my expenses, I deeply and completely accept myself.

Negative round: 
Eyebrow: I feel worried about all my expenses.
Side of Eye: I feel afraid when I think about my money problems.
Under Eye: I feel concerned about all my costs.  
And so on...

Positive round:
Eyebrow: I love knowing I can feel calm about money...
Side of Eye: I feel relaxed even though I have these expenses...
Under Eye: It feels so right to be free of this worry...
And so on...

The goal is to neutralize negative thoughts and install more positive ones to help shift your emotional state and behaviors.

 Here is a summary of your expenses:

- Rent/Mortgage Payment
- Utility bills (electricity, gas, water, sewer, trash removal) 
- Food (groceries, dining out)
- Transportation (car payment, gas, public transit fare)
- Insurance (health, auto, home, life)
- Debt payments (credit cards, student loans, personal loans)
- Entertainment/Recreation
- Personal care (medical, dental, grooming) 
- Subscriptions (streaming services, gym membership)
- Investments (retirement contributions, college fund contributions)
- Unanticipated expenses (home/auto repairs, medical emergencies)

The specific amounts for each expense category will vary for each individual based on factors like location, lifestyle, and life stage. The keys to managing your expenses are:

1. Track your spending for a few months to determine where your money goes. Look for expenses that can be reduced or eliminated.

2. Set a budget that allocates your income to necessary and discretionary expenses. Make sure to stay within the budget amounts for each category.

3. Look for ways to cut costs on essentials like food, transportation, and utilities. Some options include meal planning, public transit, and turning off lights/electronics when not used.

4. Pay off high-interest debts to avoid paying excessive monthly finance charges. Make minimum payments on low/no-interest debts.

5. Set financial goals and priorities to help determine where to allocate excess funds. Some excellent plans include saving for an emergency fund, vacation, and a down payment on a home. 

6. Review expenses periodically, look for new ways to save money, and stick to your budget. Make adjustments as needed to account for changes in income or costs.

7. Find free or low-cost alternatives for discretionary expenses like entertainment. Some options include: exercising, reading, socializing with friends, enjoying hobbies, etc.

The key is taking control of your spending by understanding where your money is going each month. Plan to reduce or eliminate unnecessary expenses and stick to a budget. With time and practice, managing your costs will become second nature. Please let me know if you have any other questions!

 

The key message is that consistently practicing EFT tapping for just 10 minutes a day can significantly reduce stress and increase abundance in your life. However, due to certain blocks and resistance, many people need help to commit to a daily tapping practice.

Some common "yes, buts" or reasons for not tapping daily include:

1. Fear of change. People are afraid tapping may work and bring positive change, which can feel threatening.

2. Not wanting to spend the time. Although 10 minutes a day can yield great benefits, some feel they are not worth the time or effort. This may stem from more profound feelings of unworthiness.

3. Fear of not recognizing yourself. As you clear emotional blocks and change through tapping, you may feel unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the new, happier you. 

The summary highlights how a daily EFT practice, even just 10 minutes, can change your energy and vibration. This leads to feeling calmer, less reactive, more creative, and ultimately more successful. While simple in theory, many unconscious blocks often get in the way. Identifying and clearing these blocks is critical to maintaining a consistent practice.

Some benefits of a daily tapping routine include the following:

•Reduced stress and increased happiness.
•Improved congruence between your conscious desires and unconscious beliefs. 
•Higher vibration and greater manifestation power. 
•Release of emotional baggage from the past.
•Greater clarity and focus in the present moment.

In summary, tapping for just 10 minutes daily can profoundly change your life positively. The challenge lies in overcoming the inner resistance and blocks that prevent consistency. Recognizing and clearing these obstacles with EFT is critical to success.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- There are common fears and resistance around making significant changes, e.g., fear of losing one's identity, disrupting family dynamics, fear of others' expectations, fear of being unable to maintain changes, and fear of uncovering traumatic issues. These fears can be addressed through tapping.

- The key question regarding resistance to change is: How does staying the same serve you? Identify the benefits of maintaining the status quo.

- Committing to tapping for 10 minutes daily can have many benefits, including reduced stress, increased confidence, better sleep, improved problem-solving, building good habits, raising your vibration, and attracting more abundance.  

- Use EFT setup phrases to address resistance to daily tapping, e.g.:

Even though I resist tapping for many reasons, I accept my feelings around this issue.  

Even though I have a conflict about doing something good for me, I accept how I feel and who I am.  

Even though I sabotage my success and progress by "forgetting" my tapping, I accept all of myself now.

- To make effective changes, identify what needs to be new - new attitudes, behaviors, beliefs, or feelings. Without changing these internal factors, external outcomes will not change.

- Develop a plan to change by:

1. Deciding on what needs to change 
2. Choosing one desired change to focus on
3. Believing that change is possible  
4. Tapping to address fears of changing and staying committed to changes

5. Considering whether it may be easier to start with changing behavior, feeling, or belief

- Change your "internal roadmap" of beliefs, feelings, and expectations to change your outcomes and destination. Get a new map to arrive at a new place.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

Affirmations to repeat:
1. There is always enough for me... 
2. I am enough...
3. I get enough of what I need...

New affirmations to change feelings of inadequacy:
1. I feel worthy...
2. I feel content...  
3. I feel complete as I am...

To change habitual lateness:

2. Organize your papers, clothes, and stuff for your day the night before.
3. Tap for being inspired to show up on time!

Focusing on your NOW:
- Releases the pain of the past 
- Creates joy in your future  
- Being present and joyful in your NOW creates a more abundant future

 Here's a summary:

- The author encourages focusing on the present moment rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.  

- Techniques like EFT tapping and making appreciation lists can help shift your mindset to the present.

- Limiting beliefs and self-sabotage are obstacles to focusing on the now. Releasing these with EFT tapping can help.

- Raising your vibration by appreciating what you love in the present moment will attract more positive experiences. Writing a "Love List" of things you understand can raise your vibration.

- If you resist doing simple exercises like writing a Love List, check for limiting beliefs and use EFT tapping to release them.

- Releasing resistance, raising your vibration, and focusing on the now can transform your life. Committing to writing a daily Love List is a great place to start.

- The key message is: focus on the present, raise your vibration, release resistance and self-sabotage, and make the most of the now. Your life will improve as a result.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the passage:

- Becoming quiet and still allows us to connect with our inner self. It helps us hear the messages from our hearts and intuitions. 
- Most people don't spend enough quiet time and lose touch with their inner wisdom. Common excuses for not being quiet include being too busy or having too much to do.
- Spending time in silence has many benefits. It reduces stress and anxiety, increases creativity and focus, leads to better decision-making, improves emotional and spiritual well-being, and enhances appreciation of life.
- Some recommendations for incorporating more quiet time: meditate, do yoga or Tai Chi, spend time in nature, limit social media and TV, set boundaries, and say no more often.
- Making the time to be quiet and reflect is essential for health, happiness, and awakening your true self. Even starting with short silence and building up from there can make a big difference.

The key message is that we should make the time to be quiet and still, despite excuses and busy schedules. Doing so will allow us to gain profound benefits and connect with our inner selves. Spending quiet time should be a priority for greater health, clarity, and spiritual well-being.

 

The key is to take the time every day to stop, be quiet, and listen to your inner voice. However, we often make excuses to avoid doing this, such as:

1. I'm too busy. You can't afford to take the time. It will save you time in the long run.

2. I don't know how to be quiet usefully. Just practice being calm and notice the benefits.  

3. It doesn't feel safe. Addressing fears about being quiet, such as through EFT tapping, can help.  

4. I get bored. Boredom is also addressable. Recognize the value and benefits of being quiet.  

5. I need help finding the point or value. There are many benefits of being quiet, including accessing your heart's wisdom, slowing down, solving problems, being less reactive, syncing your body's rhythms, raising your vibration, accessing creativity, focusing on what you want, emotional relief, and rest.  

6. It seems like a waste of time for my business. Being quiet and restful is very beneficial for success in all areas of life.  

There are many benefits to taking time each day to be quiet and listen to your inner wisdom. The most important question is: are you worth it? Choose to make time for yourself. You deserve it, and it will raise your vibration and help you manifest more abundance.

To address blocks using EFT tapping, tap on phrases like:

- Even though I'm too busy to take quiet time, I accept how I feel.  
- Even though it's not worth it to take the time to be quiet, I accept who I am right now.  
- Even though I don't have any inner wisdom to listen to anyway, I accept who I am.

Then tap on problem phrases like "I don't want to waste any time being quiet" and "I have too much to do already." Follow with solution-focused words like "What if I could feel inspired to take time to be quiet?" and "I choose to be inspired to take time to be quiet for myself."

Acting on your "next yes" by doing what feels right and good to you in each moment is an excellent practice for everyday life and reducing overwhelm. Go inside, get calm, see if the next thing you're planning to do feels like a "yes" or "no" right now, and only do what feels like a "yes." Keep following your "yeses," and you'll be well.

 

- You should make small decisions one at a time based on what feels like a "yes" to you. Follow the energy that feels good. Even delaying action for an hour or a day until it feels right can help. This will reduce overwhelm and allow the Universe to support you.

- There are barriers that can prevent you from finding your "yes": being overwhelmed, afraid, wanting to avoid decisions, feeling paralyzed by choices, afraid to upset others, and not trusting yourself. The keys are learning to interpret your body's "yes" and "no" signals and focusing on the next slight "yes."

- To get a "yes" or "no" from your heart, you need to learn to trust yourself and the signals you receive internally. Think of something pleasant to recognize a "yes" feeling and something unpleasant for a "no" sense. Then move from a tiny "yes" to the next. This will raise your vibration and allow the Universe to help you.

- Use EFT tapping to release resistance to finding your "yes." Repeat phrases like "Even though I'm not sure what a 'yes' feels like, I accept myself." Then tap on problem phrases like "I don't know how to hear a yes from inside." Finish with positive words like "I'm learning to get a yes in my heart."

- Having fun is essential for the law of attraction. It raises your mood and vibration, keeps you in the present moment, and distracts you from lack or impatience. Common barriers to the fun are believing you don't have time, don't know how, don't deserve it, or that it's not very sensible. Define fun for yourself and make time for it. The benefits of fun are that it lifts your mood, boosts creativity, gives you energy, raises your vibration, and helps manifestation.

 

• It is not harmful to put "having fun" on your to-do list. It shows that you have lost perspective on living and enjoying yourself.

• Start by putting "having fun" on your daily list to get back into the habit. Then make time each day to do something you enjoy, even small. Once you start focusing on the fun again, you will crave more of it.  

• If you don't know what's fun for you, complete sentences like: "I always have fun when I_______." "I had fun last time I _______." Ask others what they do for fun. Choose an activity and try it.

• Decide to have fun and welcome that energy into your life. Before you know it, you'll be having more fun. Changing your energy pattern will surprise you with good results.

• Raising your vibration by having fun communicates to the Universe that you want more enjoyment in life. The Universe will send you more situations with that energy.

• Use EFT tapping to help shift your energy around to having fun. Tap on phrases like "I forgot how to have fun" until your intensity decreases. Then tap on positive words about enjoying yourself now.  

• Being happy while waiting for your desires will raise your vibration, allowing more good things into your life. Waiting often makes people unhappy, impatient, and cranky, which doesn't match the energy of abundance. Practice feeling happy regardless of waiting.

• People who are happy and waiting to attract more success and abundance. Address excuses for not being satisfied, like waiting makes me unhappy; I don't trust it will help; it doesn't feel right; I'm just pretending. These are issues you can tap on.

• Ask yourself why you stay unhappy waiting for abundance. Maybe feeling unhappy serves you in some way or feels more familiar. Look at the benefits of being happy and waiting versus sad. Choose to be happy and enjoy abundance.

• Benefits of being happy waiting include more creative ideas; higher vibration; better decisions; faster manifestation; abundance right now.

• It's your choice. Choose to be happy waiting and enjoy the vibration of abundance!

 Here is a summary of the main points:

• Choose to expect an exceptional day and watch the Universe join your efforts to succeed. The Law of Attraction responds to your vibration, so expecting a great day will attract more positive experiences.  

• Expecting an exceptional day will raise your vibration and increase creativity, relaxation, clarity, and intuition. It invites more abundance.

• Many people anticipate problems out of habit, believe in being "realistic," fear disappointment, or only see downsides. These are limiting beliefs that can be addressed with EFT tapping.

• There are many benefits to expecting an exceptional day:

1. It creates space for creativity by reducing worry and anxiety. 

2. It raises your vibration, which the Law of Attraction responds to.

3. It leads to greater relaxation and rejuvenation. 

4. It brings more clarity and intuitive guidance.

• Use EFT tap on limiting beliefs like "I'm afraid to have positive expectations." Repeat setup phrases like "Even though I'm skeptical and don't want to pretend I'm going to have a good day, I accept who I am and how I feel." Measure your fear on a 0-10 scale, tap, and remeasure until you feel optimistic about expectations.

• Change your vibration by choosing to expect an exceptional, happy day. The Universe will join in to help make it happen.

What if we could get out of our own way and attract "all of the above" into our personal and professional lives?  
How much abundance would flow in...
What if we could attract and have All of the Above? Then what would happen to us, our thoughts, and our lives? Do we want All of the Above? Are we chasing something we don't like?  
It's a little overwhelming for some people – you mean I could have everything I want? Yes, you could, but you will need to make some energetic adjustments — changes in your attitude, habits, beliefs, and vibration. It's not that difficult or time-consuming, but it means we must address our emotional conflicts to get congruent and lined up with attracting everything we want.

What if you could attract everything you want in every part of your life? Would that feel satisfying to you? Would that indeed be what you've always wanted?
There are some very challenging responses to these questions. Surprising emotions surface around the idea of attracting All of the Above.  

One part of the conflict is that we have been conditioned to struggle. So now what? Is it possible to let go of the struggle? Another challenge is that being poised to attract All of the Above means we would need to let go of our conflicts about having all we want – matches such as the fear of other people's reactions, the worry about what might change, etc.  

Imagine that you can check that little box that says All of the Above and enjoy all the abundances you have been dreaming about. Does this give you a relaxed and enjoyable feeling? Or does it feel uncomfortable, stretching you too far? What emotional blocks surface for you? Does it make you feel lost without something to fight for?  

Identifying these blocks is yet another opportunity to clear any of your conflicts about being outrageously abundant in every part of your life. Are you ready to do some clearing?
Answer the following questions about receiving All of the Above...

(1) What's the "downside" to attracting "All of the Above" in your life?  
(2) What's the "upside" to not getting everything you want?  
(3) How does it serve you not to check that box with the Universe that offers "All of the Above"?  

These are my favorite powerful questions. Once you know the upside of not being open to the abundance or the downside of having All of the Above, you can tap on the blocks and change your energy to enjoy unity with a successful life.

Here's what I know... People who believe they can attract All of the Above, in fact, *do* attract more success and abundance! 

(1) Choosing to be congruent with attracting All of the Above will alert the Universe that you can handle receiving it all. 
(2) Choosing to check the box (energetically) that says "All of the Above" will allow you to release the resistance you have been holding in your body and mind. Now the Law of Attraction can deliver you all you have requested. (Remember, the Law of Attraction "hears" your vibration, not your words.)  
(3) Being aligned with attracting All of the Above will bring peace from that mind chatter that interferes with your positive vibration.   

As Law of Attraction teachers say — it's all energy. So change your point by being inspired to accept and attract All of the Above, even if it initially feels a little overwhelming or foreign to you. This will automatically invite the Universe to help you create more abundance right now.  

Remember, the Law of Attraction sends you situations with the same energy as the vibration you are putting out... so when you are already joyful by believing you can attract All of the Above, the Universe will bring you more opportunities for abundance.

Even though I'm afraid to have it all, I accept who I am and how I feel."  
"Even though I'm accustomed to living a life of struggle, I accept all parts of me anyway."
"Even though I'm not sure I feel safe attracting All of the Above, I accept who I am and how I feel."

Thank You, Universe, for inspiring me to be ready to receive All of the Above.  

What if you looked for things, people, and situations to Fall in Love with today? I wonder how much abundance would flow into your life...

This is not about romantic love. This is about the energy and vibration of love and how it can help us feel better and improve our lives. Let's look at what happens when we fall or feel "in love."  

When people fall in love, their vibration improves immediately and dramatically. When you are in love, everything looks cheerful, you have those "in love" feelings – nothing seems to go wrong, you give everyone the benefit of the doubt, waiting in line is no problem, traffic jams aren't that bad, and situations turn into opportunities.  

There is so much fun to

 Here's a summary of the key points:

- Being in love activates positive feelings that raise our vibration and attract more abundance. 
- Rather than waiting for an ideal romantic partner, we can fall in love with anything - an object, idea, pet, etc. This raises our mood and vibration.
- We feel powerful, happy, creative, and in a good mood when we're in love. We can cultivate this mindset daily by finding things to fall in love with. 
- Some standard blocks to falling in love daily are: not seeing the point, not feeling safe, being more comfortable finding fault, and serving us to stay critical. We can address these with EFT tapping.
- Benefits of falling in love daily include: accessing creativity, raising vibration to attract more joy, relaxing the body, gaining clarity, and feeling secure in decisions.  
- We can use EFT setup phrases and tapping to release blocks and cultivate the mindset of falling in love. Focus on accepting ourselves, releasing fears, and positive words about intending and choosing to fall in love.

- Being present and focusing on each moment, "One NOW at a Time," can help us witness and appreciate each moment as it comes. This counters our tendency to multitask, rush, and focus on productivity over presence. 
- Being present, even for short periods, helps us gain a new perspective, reduces stress and overwhelm, and helps us feel gratitude for the simple things. 
- We can start by being fully present for routine daily activities like brushing teeth, showering, drinking coffee, etc. This helps build our "presence muscle."
- Each moment is an opportunity to start fresh and choose peace, joy, and love. Staying present helps us do so.

In summary, by falling in love daily and being fully present in each moment, we can significantly raise our vibration and live more abundantly and joyfully. Focusing on cultivating love and presence is simple but powerful.

 

The key message is that focusing on the present moment, or the "now," has many benefits and can attract more success and abundance. However, many people struggle with this for several reasons:

1. Being too busy. The solution is to learn to say no, make time for yourself, and tap on feelings of being too busy.

2. Worrying about the future. But focusing on the end only makes you more prepared. The present moment is what's important. 

3. Fear of missing out. But you will catch what matters if you are focused on the now. Tap on the fear of missing out.

4. Not seeing the benefits. There are many upsides to being in the now, like more creativity, higher vibration, more clarity, and a calmer body. Identify the upsides of being distracted from the now to uncover the underlying issues, then tap on them.

5. Feeling unsafe. Tap on feelings of unsafety around being in the now. 

6. Habit of worrying. Tap on worrying about the past or future rather than being in the now.

Benefits of being in the now include:

1. More space for creativity. 
2. Higher vibration, which attracts more abundance. 
3. Calmer, more rejuvenated body.
4. More clarity and better decision-making.

Tapping sequences are provided to help release blocks around being in the now and build appreciation for the present moment. Phrases focus on the issues, then shift to positive outcomes. The message is that releasing doubts about your ability to attract abundance and be in the now will significantly raise your vibration and help you manifest your desires. Start with one area of life at a time. Success builds upon itself.

The key takeaway is that trying to release doubts, slow down, and appreciate the present moment can be rewarding. It leads to greater peace, clarity, creativity, and abundance. But start slowly and be gentle with yourself. Any progress is progress.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

•Releasing your doubts about attracting what you want will raise your vibration and allow more abundance into your life. 
•Doubts lower your vibration and block the Universe from delivering what you desire. 
•Releasing doubts makes you feel more relaxed and peaceful, which helps attract more success and abundance.
•Releasing doubts is good for your body and mind. It gives your mind more space to be creative and grateful.
•Change your energy by releasing doubts, even if it feels uncomfortable. This will invite the Universe to help create more abundance. 
•The Law of Attraction sends situations that match your vibration. When you release doubts and feel confident, the Universe brings more opportunities that match that feeling.
•Use EFT tapping to release doubts and raise your vibration. Repeat phrases like "I'm afraid to release my doubts" while tapping. Then replace with positive words like "I'm willing to release some doubts." 
•Focus on appreciation and positive feelings no matter what is happening. This raises your vibration and helps attract more of what you want. 
•Use EFT to tap on negative feelings and frustrations. Then focus on gratitude, appreciation, and abundance to shift your energy. 
•Sending love to challenges and relationships helps shift the energy and outcome. Fear, annoyance, and restriction block abundance. Sending love invites more positive results.

The key benefits of releasing doubts and shifting your energy to gratitude and love are:

The key message is that we can improve our vibration of abundance by celebrating our future successes before they happen. This helps release resistance and communicate receptive energy to the Universe, allowing our desires to manifest more easily.

To celebrate our future abundance:

1. Decide what you want and act as if you already have it. 
2. Practice the feelings of already having what you want. 
3. Release doubts about this process.
4. Enjoy the celebration - use all your senses and emotions. 
5. Keep the celebration short but do it regularly.

This exercise helps change our vibration and receive what we've requested. Although it may seem unrealistic, it requires little effort and can be powerful. Many of us were taught not to count our chickens before they hatch, but that's precisely what this game asks us to do.

By celebrating now, we release resistance and communicate joyful, receptive energy to the Universe. Our vibration of abundance improves dramatically, allowing our desires to manifest more easily.
