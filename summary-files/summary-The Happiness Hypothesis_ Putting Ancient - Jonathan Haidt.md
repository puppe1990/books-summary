 

The book explores ten ancient ideas about human flourishing 
and happiness in light of modern psychological research. The first 
two ideas concern the divided nature of the human mind and how our 
thoughts shape our experiences. The author then discusses reciprocity
and hypocrisy in social relationships. He examines various hypotheses 
about the sources of happiness, arguing that both external and internal 
factors matter. The book combines insights from ancient philosophies, 
including those of India, China and the Mediterranean, with recent 
scientific findings to develop a balanced understanding of well-being.

 

- The author first rode a horse in 1991 and froze in panic when the horse headed to the edge of a path. However,  the horse knew what it was doing and turned safely. The author realized he had the wrong metaphor - he was thinking of the horse as a car that needs to be steered.

- Metaphors are crucial to human thinking. They help us understand new or complex concepts by relating them to familiar ones. Many ancient thinkers used animal metaphors for the mind and self. Buddha compared the mind to a wild elephant, Plato compared the self to a chariot pulled by two horses (one good, one unruly), and Freud compared the mind to a horse and buggy. 

- These thinkers saw the struggle to control appetites and passions as central to ethics and psychology. However, as technology advanced, people adopted new metaphors of the mind as a driver or computer program. Social scientists focused on the rational mind and ignored the unconscious passions and desires.

- But people continue to act against their interests and stated goals. The author gives examples of needing more willpower and following through on resolutions. Our desires, lusts and fears often overpower our reasoning. The author felt powerless to make some life decisions despite knowing what he "should" do.

- The Roman poet Ovid captured this internal struggle well in describing Medea as torn between her love for Jason and her duty to her father. She felt "dragged along by a strange new force" as "Desire and reason are pulling in different directions."

In summary, the critical point is that metaphors shape how we think. Many early thinkers adopted animal metaphors to capture the internal struggle between reason and passion, intellect and appetite. Though contemporary thinkers focused more on rationality, passions remain powerful influences on human thinking and behavior.

 

- Modern theories about rational choice and information processing must fully explain weakness of will and self-control. The metaphor of a rider on an elephant helps us understand this. 

- The mind is divided in four ways:
1. Mind vs... Body: The body and its parts often have "a mind of their own" and act independently of our intentions and wishes. For example, the gut brain controls digestion independently and causes conditions like irritable bowel syndrome. 

2. Left vs. Right: The brain's two hemispheres specialize in different functions. The left hemisphere controls speech and analyitical tasks while the right hemisphere processes spatial patterns and faces. In split-brain patients, the hemispheres can act as two separate intelligences. 

- When information is presented to only one hemisphere, the other hemisphere will confabulate reasons to explain the person's response, showing how we fabricate explanations for our behavior. 

- These divisions in the mind and body mean we do not have as much conscious control over our actions and choices as we think. We may see and approve the right course of action but still follow the wrong one, like an elephant going where it wants. The rider's control is limited.

 

Michael Gazzaniga, a neuroscientist who studied split-brain patients, found that the brain's left hemisphere contains an "interpreter module" that provides a running commentary on a person's actions and choices. However, this module has no direct access to the actual motivations or causes of the person's behavior. For example, if the word "walk" was shown to only the right brain hemisphere of a split-brain patient, that patient might stand up and walk away. When asked why, the left brain hemisphere might confabulate a reason, such as "I am going to get a Coke." The interpreter module is adept at making up explanations, even when it lacks information about the true causes of behavior. 

Gazzaniga's findings illustrated how the human mind contains semi-independent modules that can operate separately and even work at cross-purposes. One module in particular, the interpreter module, generates convincing explanations for behavior even when it lacks insight into the actual motivations for that behavior. Essentially, the interpreter module corresponds to the metaphorical "rider" part of the mind.

The human brain has evolved in stages, with newer parts built on top of older parts. The oldest part, the limbic system, governs basic drives and emotions. As the brain evolved further in animals and humans, a new outer layer—the neocortex—developed. In humans, the frontal cortex portion of the neocortex enables advanced cognition, planning, reasoning, and decision making. This has led to the "Promethean script" of human mental evolution, in which basic emotions and drives initially governed humans until the rational neocortex emerged, giving us superior self-control and reasoning.

However, this view needs to be more complex. The frontal cortex did not just provide rationality; it also enabled an increased emotional capacity, primarily through the orbitofrontal cortex. Damage to the orbitofrontal cortex impairs emotional reactions and decision making despite intact reasoning skills. The orbitofrontal cortex helps generate emotional appraisals of situations, guiding reasoning and choice. Emotion and rationality evolved together and now cooperate in the human mind.

 

- Human rationality and reasoning depend on emotions. Emotions and reason work together to generate intelligent behavior, but emotions do most of the work. The metaphor of an elephant and its rider is more fitting than Plato's metaphor of reason controlling passion. 

- There are two processing systems in the human mind: controlled processes and automatic processes. Controlled processes require effort, happen consciously, and can only handle one thing simultaneously. Automatic processes happen unconsciously, in parallel, and handle many things simultaneously. Most mental processes are automatic. 

- Controlled processes evolved much more recently than automatic processes and required language. Automatic processes have evolved for hundreds of millions of years to help organisms respond quickly to the environment. The rider evolved to serve the elephant, not the other way around.

- Language allows humans to escape "stimulus control partially" and blind responses to rewards. Humans can think about long-term goals and consider alternatives not visually present. However, the automatic system still has more power to influence behavior. The controlled system has little power relative to the automatic system.

- In summary, the elephant does most of the work. The rider evolved to serve the elephant's needs, not to be in control. Although the rider allows some escape from stimulus control, the automatic system remains far more powerful in generating behavior. Reason depends critically on emotions and the automatic system.

The critical point is that emotions, intuition, and automatic processes are far more influential over thought and behavior than most people recognize. Conscious reasoning depends on these more primitive systems and has a limited ability to override them. When faced with difficult choices, we should not assume that reason alone will determine the outcome. We must consider how the elephant, the automatic system, perceives and approaches the issue. The pros and cons that seem most compelling to the rational rider may not be the factors that ultimately sway the elephant.

 

The automatic system acts quickly and is linked to feelings of pleasure and pain. It is involved in survival instincts and wanting immediate rewards. The controlled system is slower and more deliberative. It helps the automatic system make better long-term choices. However, the controlled system is limited in overriding the automatic system.

For example, in Walter Mischel's marshmallow experiment, children who were better able to delay gratification by not eating a marshmallow immediately had better life outcomes. Their secret was using strategies to avoid temptation by distracting themselves. Developing this kind of emotional intelligence, where the "rider" can guide the "elephant" without directly fighting it, is essential for overcoming self-control failures.

Another example is intrusive thoughts, like imagining jumping off a cliff or screaming at a dinner party. These arise automatically but become obsessions when we suppress them, leading to an "ironic process" where monitoring for the thoughts brings them to mind. The thoughts are random associations, but we assume they reveal our hidden desires or nature. 

A final example is the difficulty of winning an argument. When presented with a scenario of incest between consenting adult siblings, we have a substantial adverse reaction but struggle to justify it rationally. Our rational arguments are rationalizations of the automatic reaction. We are reluctant to change our view even when shown that our arguments could be more robust. The elephant tends to win in these situations.

In summary, the automatic and controlled systems often conflict, but the automatic system generally has the upper hand due to its speed, efficiency, and connection to motivation and emotions. The controlled system is an automatic system advisor with limited power to override it.

 

- Moral judgments and arguments often come from intuition and gut feelings rather than rational reasoning. We justify our positions after the fact. 
- Our minds are composed of many parts, but we identify too closely with our conscious verbal thinking. We are surprised when our intuitions, urges and emotions emerge, even though they are a big part of our identity. 
- The idea that our interpretations shape our reality is popular in self-help and pop psychology. By changing how we think about events, we can change our world. This idea has been around for centuries.
- Boethius, a 6th century Roman philosopher, was guided to change his thinking while imprisoned. His guide, Lady Philosophy, showed him new perspectives to reframe his situation. He realized that change is expected, fortune is fickle, and happiness comes from within. 
- However, insights and reframing did by the conscious mind, or "the rider," are often insufficient to create real change. Lasting change requires retraining the intuitive, emotional mind, or "the elephant." Epiphanies tend to fade quickly without changes at a deeper level.

The key points are:

1) Rational reasoning often follows intuition in moral judgments and arguments. 
2) We identify too much with our conscious minds and are surprised by the intuitions and emotions that shape us. 
3) The belief that our interpretations create our reality is old, though insights alone usually do not lead to lasting change. 
4) Boethius's story shows how reframing situations can bring insight, but the elephant (intuition) must also be retrained for real change.

 

- The human mind makes judgments about whether we like or dislike things automatically and unconsciously, using a kind of "like-o-meter." Even simple animals have systems for quick judgments about approaching or avoiding things. 
- This like-o-meter influences human judgments and decisions in subtle ways. For example, people are biased toward things that sound similar to their names. 
- The human mind tends to be negatively biased, reacting more strongly and quickly to bad things. This makes sense evolutionarily, as missing a threat could be deadly. Negativity bias means terrible events have a more significant impact than good ones.
- The human mind has opposing motivational systems, like approach and withdrawal, that is always active in different balances. The balance point between these systems can shift quickly in response to events. For example, curiosity draws us to an accident scene but then horror makes us recoil. 
- The withdrawal system responds quickly to events to get first access to incoming information. This quick response to potential threats contributes to negativity bias.

So in summary, the key ideas are: like-o-meter, negativity bias, opposing motivational systems, withdrawal system quick response. The human mind tends to focus on and react more strongly to the negative, but we can work to balance this tendency with conscious effort.

 

The thalamus acts as a central switching station in the brain that relays sensory information to different parts of the cortex for processing. Information is then sent to the frontal cortex, integrated into higher-level thinking and consciousness. However, this pathway can take a couple seconds. The amygdala provides a faster pathway for emotional processing. It monitors information from the thalamus for emotional relevance and can trigger an emotional reaction before the cortex has finished processing it. 

The amygdala triggers the fight or flight response by connecting to the brainstem. It can also influence thinking in the frontal cortex, causing a shift to a more withdrawal-oriented mindset. Emotions and cognition influence each other bidirectionally. Emotions can bias how we think, and our thoughts can evoke emotions.

An individual's affective style, or typical level of happiness, depends on the balance of power between the approach and withdrawal systems in their brain. This balance has a vital genetic component and is relatively stable across a person's lifetime. Emotional outlook can be seen in asymmetries in frontal cortex activity. More suitable frontal activity correlates with a more withdrawal-oriented and negative affective style. More excellent left frontal activity correlates with a more approach-oriented, upbeat, and practical style.

In summary, the thalamus relays information to the cortex, which sends it to the frontal cortex for higher-level processing. The amygdala provides a faster pathway for emotional processing and can trigger withdrawal-oriented responses. A person's affective style and emotional reactivity depend on inborn asymmetries in frontal cortex activity, representing a "cortical lottery."

 

The passage discusses three effective methods for changing your affective style (i.e. emotional tendencies and habits): meditation, cognitive therapy and medication. 

1. Meditation: Meditation trains your mind by focusing attention in a non-analytical way, which helps reduce negative and anxious thoughts. Regular meditation can alter thought processes and reduce attachments and reactions to events. Although you give up some pleasures, you also avoid more considerable pains. Meditation calms the mind and reduces negative thoughts, improving effective style.

2. Cognitive Therapy: Developed by Aaron Beck, cognitive therapy challenges irrational and self-critical thoughts. Beck found distorted and unrealistic thought processes in depressed patients and trained them to identify and correct these thoughts. This breaks the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. Cognitive therapy teaches people to monitor their thoughts, identify distortions and find alternative thoughts. It works by training the conscious mind to guide the intuitive mind, gradually shaping behavior and thought patterns. Cognitive therapy, especially with behaviorism, is very effective for depression, anxiety and other issues. 

3. Medication: Medication, especially antidepressants, can positively impact a person's affective style by altering brain chemistry and neural pathways. Medication provides a biological mechanism to change mindsets and thought/behavior patterns when the other methods are not fully effective or complicated.

In summary, while we cannot necessarily change ourselves through willpower alone, we can improve our affective styles over the long run by using these tools and techniques to positively alter our thinking, mental habits, and brain structure. Meditation, cognitive therapy and medication represent Eastern and Western approaches to accomplishing this goal.

 

- Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to work for many people. It helps people change problematic thinking patterns and behaviors. Studies show that people who receive CBT improve faster than those on waiting lists or receiving other therapies. When done well, CBT can be as effective as antidepressant drugs like Prozac for depression. However, the benefits of CBT tend to last longer after treatment ends because people have learned new skills. 

- Prozac, the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant, works by increasing serotonin levels in the brain. However, scientists do not fully understand how it works. It can take 4-6 weeks of use before the benefits emerge. Prozac and related drugs have been shown to help with many conditions, including depression, anxiety, panic, OCD, and eating disorders.

- Prozac is controversial for two reasons. First, it provides a shortcut to improved mental health that avoids the effort of psychotherapy. Second, it can change personality and habitual behaviors, not just relieve symptoms. Some see this as problematic "cosmetic psychopharmacology." However, for some, Prozac provided personality changes they had long wanted, like becoming less worried and more optimistic.

- There is a tension between self-improvement and authenticity. While culture endorses both, self-improvement is often seen as a lifelong struggle toward one's "ideal self." Quick fixes like Prozac that produce significant changes can seem inauthentic or like "pandora's box." However, for some, Prozac allowed them to become the self they wanted to be. The author argues that we should reconsider authenticity and be "true to ourselves."

- The author studies moral reactions to taboo but harmless acts. Research suggests innate moral intuitions, like seeing the body as a "temple," underlie and constrain cultural, moral rules. So, radical self-transformation through drugs or surgery can seem shocking or wrong to many, even without apparent harm. However, if the goal is to become happier and less inhibited, why shouldn't people change themselves as they wish? The author found that Paxil allowed him to change in ways he wanted.

 

The author describes how the movie The Godfather portrays reciprocity in action through the interaction between Bonasera and Don Corleone. Bonasera wants revenge for an assault on his daughter, but Corleone refuses to kill the perpetrators. However, Corleone tells Bonasera that the men would have suffered if he had come to him as a friend. Corleone accepts Bonasera's friendship and gives him justice as a "gift" on his daughter's wedding day, tying Bonasera to Corleone. 

The author explains reciprocity as a deep instinct and the "basic currency of social life." Ultrasociality, or living in large cooperative societies, evolved independently in several species, including humans, ants, bees, wasps, termites, and naked mole rats. A feature that enabled cooperation, like kin altruism, was already present in these species. Kin altruism explains cooperation in small groups, but not in the large groups seen in ultrasocial species. These species became ultrasocial by evolving into "ultrakinship," like ants, bees, and mole rats. Most members are sterile or have suppressed reproduction, so they are all siblings with a shared interest in the queen's survival. This led to ultracooperation and self-sacrifice to support the group.

Humans became ultrasocial through reciprocal altruism, where unrelated individuals help each other. This requires mechanisms to detect cheaters, encourage cooperation, and allow unrelated individuals to become "like family." Language, morality, and social norms provide this framework for humans. Overall, the author argues that reciprocity and ultrasociality in humans stem from innate mechanisms that bind us together through cooperation.

 

- Social insects like ants exhibit a high degree of social cooperation and division of labor within their colonies. Humans also engage in kinship altruism by using fictitious kinship terms to reinforce social bonds. However, kinship altruism can only extend so far. 

- Humans exhibit a strong tendency for reciprocity - doing unto others as they do unto you. This tit-for-tat strategy helps foster cooperation with non-kin. Vengeance and gratitude are emotions that help enforce reciprocity.

- Evidence shows that humans have neural mechanisms for tracking reciprocity and fairness. The ultimatum game shows that humans often reject unfair offers to punish selfish behavior, even at a cost to themselves. Brain imaging shows that accepting or rejecting unfair offers correlates with activity in brain regions involved in emotion and reasoning.

- Gratitude and vengeance coevolved as mechanisms to encourage and enforce reciprocity. Vengeance deters cheating while gratitude encourages cooperation. These mechanisms allow for the formation of large cooperative groups. 

- Gossip is another mechanism that allows for large human social groups. By spreading information about who can be trusted and who cheats, gossip helps foster cooperation on a large scale. The human brain is very energetically expensive, which may be an adaptation for the complex social cognition required for managing gossip and social relationships.

In summary, humans have evolved kinship, reciprocity, emotion, and language mechanisms for large-scale social cooperation and ultrasociality. These mechanisms reinforce social bonds, encourage cooperation, deter cheating, and allow for the spread of reputation information across large networks of people.

 

- Human beings have enormous brains for their body size compared to other animals. This imposes high costs on human parents to raise offspring. 
- The social brain hypothesis suggests that large brains evolved in humans to manage increasingly large social groups. As group sizes increased, grooming became inadequate and language evolved to help maintain social bonds.
- Robin Dunbar found that brain size correlates with group size across species. A group size of around 150 is typical for humans based on our brain size. Studies show this is a natural group size for humans. 
- Dunbar proposes that language evolved to enable gossip as a way to maintain relationships in larger groups. Gossip is a non-zero-sum game that costs little but benefits both parties by exchanging social information.
- A study found that most gossip is critical and focused on moral and social violations of others. Gossip makes people feel more powerful and connected, and helps enforce moral norms. Though people view gossip negatively, it serves critical social functions.
- Reciprocity, combined with gossip and reputation, allows "what goes around come around." It encourages cooperation and deters selfish acts. However, people often fail to reciprocate fairly due to self-serving biases and hypocrisy.
- Reciprocity is a powerful principle that can be used for good or exploited for gain. Salespeople and fundraisers often give small gifts to trigger people's reciprocity reflex and get more significant returns. Awareness of manipulative techniques that abuse reciprocity and social influence is essential.

In summary, language and gossip evolved in humans to help manage large social groups by enabling cooperation through reciprocity and reputation. Reciprocity is a double-edged sword that can lead to prosocial and manipulative behavior. Awareness of how reciprocity works can help avoid exploitation while promoting cooperation.

 

• Rush Limbaugh and Congressman Ed Schrock are examples of hypocrites who condemned certain acts they were found guilty of. Their downfalls illustrate people's particular pleasure in witnessing the irony of moralists brought down for the moral failings they condemn.

• Stories of moral failings and hypocrisy are common forms of gossip and provide a way for people to bond over shared moral outrage. However, we are all prone to hypocrisy and often blind to our moral failings.

• Research shows that the tit-for-tat strategy - cooperating while remaining vigilant for cheaters - is most successful in iterated games. However, in real life, people react not directly to others' actions but to their perceptions, which can be manipulated.

• Machiavelli argued that most people are satisfied with appearances over reality and can be more influenced by what seems to be rather than what is. Some argue that humans evolved to play life in a Machiavellian way, cultivating reputations for fairness and trustworthiness regardless of the truth.

• In one study, Dan Batson allowed subjects to choose between appearing fair or being fair. Most chose to appear fair while acting unfairly, showing how strongly people value keeping up appearances.

• These findings suggest we are prone to hypocrisy and good at deceiving ourselves about our moral failings by focusing on appearances over reality. Our moral certainties may often reflect more a desire to signal virtue than actual virtue. Recognizing our shared flaws can help overcome self-righteousness and moral divides.

 Here is a summary:

- A study found that people tend to act self-interestedly, even when given a chance to be fair, by flipping a coin. When the coin flip went against their self-interest, people found ways to ignore it. 
- People often do not realize they are acting selfishly or immorally. We are good at finding reasons to justify our actions and believe those reasons.
- We have an "inner lawyer" that finds reasons to support our intuitions. Like an actual lawyer, this inner lawyer is trying to build a case, not find the truth. 
- Studies show we often take a position, then look for evidence to support it ("makes-sense" stopping rule). We ignore evidence against our viewpoints.
- When there is pressure or motivation to reach a preferred conclusion, we become even worse reasoners. We go on "cognitive missions" to find reasons to support what we already want to believe. 
- But because we can usually find such reasons, we maintain an "illusion of objectivity" that our position is rationally justified. 
- Ben Franklin showed insight in catching himself doing this. He found a reason to start eating fish again after being vegetarian, realizing people can find a reason for anything they want to do. 
- The "inner lawyer" is our conscious reasoning self, taking orders from our intuitions and emotions. However, our intuitions and emotions are also shaped by the processes of reasoning they employ. There is interaction and feedback between the two.

So in summary, the key ideas are:
1) We act in self-interested ways but do not realize it. 
2) We have a capacity for "motivated reasoning" to justify our actions and beliefs. 
3) This involves an "inner lawyer" that builds a case to defend our intuitions rather than find the truth.
4) The interaction between intuition and reasoning shapes each other in a feedback loop.

 

- We present an idealized version of ourselves to others to gain benefits and cooperation. 
- We are wary of how others present themselves and seek to gain more benefits than they deserve.
- Social life involves constant social comparison where we spin comparisons in our favor by inflating our claims or disparaging others.
- Psychological research shows we accurately perceive others but have distorted, rose-colored views of ourselves. 
- Studies show people overestimate their own virtue, generosity, and other positive qualities compared to others. 
- Ambiguity allows us to define traits in self-serving ways and find evidence that confirms our inflated views of ourselves.
- These self-serving biases cause problems, making us feel entitled and resentful of others we see as not contributing as much. 
- In negotiations and disputes, the same biases lead to hypocritical indignation and failure to reach an agreement.
- Research shows that de-biasing negotiators by making them aware of self-serving biases or hiding their identities until later can help address these issues.

The key ideas are that we have positive illusions about ourselves and perceive and judge ourselves differently than others, and these tendencies cause problems in relationships and disputes. Awareness of and addressing self-serving biases may help mitigate some of these issues.

 

- People are generally open to information that helps them predict other people's behavior, but they are reluctant to adjust their self-perceptions and views. 
- Several studies show that even when people are taught about cognitive biases and self-serving biases, they do not change their self-ratings and views of themselves. They readily apply the knowledge to understand others but not themselves. This is due to "naive realism" - the belief that we see the world objectively as it is, while others' views are biased.
- The need to see good vs. evil in the world leads people to search for "villains" to blame, even in times of peace and prosperity. These villains are often invisible, spread by contagion, and require teamwork to defeat. This provides a sense of mission and purpose. 
- Religions have grappled with the problem of evil in the world. Solutions include: 1) dualism - good vs. evil forces that are equal; 2) monism - evil is an illusion; 3) a blend where God's goodness is reconciled with the existence of evil (e.g., in Christianity). In practice, many gravitate towards a dualistic good vs. evil view.  
- From a psychological view, the tendency towards "Manichaeism" or a good vs. evil dualism makes sense as an outgrowth of our evolved "Machiavellian" tendencies - to protect our self-esteem and blame others. We exaggerate the vices of the "other side" and see ourselves as virtuous. 
- Roy Baumeister's analysis shows that evil acts are often perpetrated by those who do not see themselves as evil. They feel justified in their actions, often seeing themselves as victims responding to provocation. Victims also often share some blame in escalating conflicts. So evil is rarely "pure" - it arises from a cycle of provocation and retaliation between flawed human beings.

 

- Cases of apparent police brutality or violence are often more complex than portrayed in the media. The whole story usually involves reasons and motives beyond just "evil."

- Roy Baumeister is a social psychologist who seeks the truth even if it violates political correctness or blames victims. He argues that we must see evil as pure, with purely evil motives and innocent victims. However, violence usually arises from perceived injustices or retaliation, not pure evil. 

- The "myth of pure evil" is a self-serving bias perpetuating violence cycles. Those who question it are seen as siding with evil. However, recognizing the complex motives behind the violence is critical to reducing it.

- The leading causes of violence are not greed or sadism but threatened self-esteem and moral idealism. High but unstable self-esteem and belief in the moral righteousness of one's cause can justify almost any means. 

- The world we experience comprises human judgments and social constructions, not objective reality. Our tendency to constantly judge people as good or bad, right or wrong, perpetuates conflict. 

- To counter this, we must stop taking the game of life and moral judgments so seriously. We can become detached from outcomes and avoid getting caught up in likes/dislikes and praise/blame. Meditation and cognitive techniques like examining distorting thoughts can help reduce judgmentalism and reactivity.

- Recognizing the complex causes of human behavior and avoiding simplistic moral judgments of good vs. evil can help promote peace and harmony. We must strive to see beyond superficial appearances and understand each other.

 

- According to the author, pursuing happiness is futile and leads to disappointment. He cites the example of the author of Ecclesiastes who attained wealth, power and pleasure but found no lasting satisfaction. 

- Buddha and Stoic philosophers like Epictetus taught that happiness comes from within, not externally. One must avoid attachment to material goods or outcomes and cultivate an attitude of acceptance.

- However, recent research shows that some external things are worth pursuing and contribute to happiness. In particular, success and progress toward goals activate the brain's pleasure centers. 

- There are two types of positive feelings related to goal pursuit:

1. Pre-goal attainment positive affect: The pleasure felt during progress toward a goal. This is the more significant source of happiness.

2. Post-goal attainment positive affect: The feeling of contentment upon achieving a goal. This tends to be anti-climactic.

- The brain works best with immediate reinforcement. It has trouble connecting the pleasure felt upon achieving a long-sought goal to the work done to achieve that goal over a long period. 

- Therefore, for sustained happiness, one should focus more on the progress toward goals rather than the outcome. The journey is more important than the destination. Expecting a lasting thrill from achieving success often leads to disappointment.

That is the critical summary and takeaway from the explanation. Let me know if you wantwant me to clarify or expand on any summary part.

 Here is a summary of the key ideas:

1. The progress principle: People derive more pleasure from making progress toward goals than from achieving them. Happiness comes from moving forward, not standing still.

2. The adaptation principle: People adapt to both good and bad events, returning most of the way to their baseline level of happiness. Lottery winners and people with paraplegia ultimately end up not much happier or unhappier than before their life-changing events. Happiness depends more on changes in conditions than on absolute levels. 

3. Happiness levels are highly heritable and stable. In the long run, major life events do not change a person's level of happiness very much. People get stuck on a "hedonic treadmill".

4. Some philosophies and religions, like Buddhism and Stoicism, suggest that lasting happiness comes from within, not external events or circumstances. However, this is only partly true.

5. External factors like relationships, health, freedom, and income have little influence on happiness for most people. However, strong social connections and relationships are exceptions that provide lasting benefits for well-being.

6. Many desirable life factors like youth, beauty, and wealth are subject to adaptation and provide little lasting gain in happiness. However, other factors, like social relationships, are less subject to adaptation and significantly influence well-being.

In summary, while a person's happiness level is primarily determined by genetics, solid social connections and relationships are vital for well-being and provide benefits that people do not fully adapt to. Most other life events and circumstances have little lasting impact on happiness due to adaptation. However, making progress toward meaningful goals, not standing still, continues to influence how people feel.

 

- Research shows that people generally do not adapt completely to adverse conditions in life. While people may adapt somewhat, certain conditions continue to reduce well-being.  
- People need to fully adapt to two conditions: noise and long, traffic-filled commutes. Exposure to chronic noise and long commutes impair concentration, increase stress, and reduce happiness.
- Although people quickly adapt to increased space in a larger home, they must adapt to the negative impacts of a longer, traffic-filled commute. Even after years, long commutes in heavy traffic continue to decrease well-being.
- While genetics account for a large portion of someone's happiness set point, a person's environment, and voluntary actions also significantly impact their happiness level. One's happiness depends on their biological set point, the conditions of their life, and the voluntary activities they choose to do. 
- Voluntary activities, like meditation or learning a new skill, are more promising for increasing happiness than trying to change one's life conditions. Voluntary activities require choice and effort, so they are less subject to adaptation. 
- The “happiness formula” is: Happiness = Set Point + Life Conditions + Voluntary Activities. So while a person's biology may establish a range for happiness, conditions and voluntary actions can influence where a person falls within that range.
- The extreme "happiness hypothesis" that says happiness depends entirely on one's biological set point is incorrect. Life conditions and voluntary activities also substantially impact a person's happiness level.
- The happiness hypothesis promoted by Buddha and Epictetus - that happiness depends primarily on accepting one's circumstances and detaching from excessive desire - is too extreme. While cultivating acceptance and limiting attachments are beneficial voluntary activities for increasing happiness, a variety of life conditions and other voluntary actions also matter for well-being.

In summary, while genetics strongly influence happiness, environment and voluntary actions also significantly impact happiness. A balanced understanding of the relationship between nature and nurture is required to increase happiness and well-being effectively.

 

Stress hormones increase with stressful commutes and lack of control. Studies show that even believing you have control over stressors can help reduce their negative impacts. One study gave nursing home residents either actual control over minor decisions or the belief that they had control. Those with actual control were happier, healthier, and lived longer. 

While attractive people are not necessarily happier, plastic surgery that reduces feelings of shame and self-consciousness does increase happiness and life satisfaction long-term. Eliminating a daily burden of shame and discomfort can improve self-confidence and happiness.

Relationships are one of the most important factors for happiness. Good relationships make people happy, and happier people have better relationships. Relationship conflicts, like annoying coworkers or relationship issues, consistently reduce happiness.

While some level of external factors matters for happiness, chasing wealth, fame, and status often backfires and reduces happiness and health. The right kinds of activity—flow activities—are challenging, engaging, and matched to one's skills. These activities, like sports, hobbies, socializing, and creative pursuits, produce a flow where you are immersed in the present moment. Flow activities lead to frequent positive feelings and gratification.

A good, happy life balances pleasures and gratifications. Pleasures should be spaced, savored, and varied to prevent adaptation and maintain potency. Gratifications, or flow activities, engage your skills and strengths, releasing you from self-consciousness. A balance of properly spaced pleasures and frequent flow states constitutes the well-lived, happy life.

In summary, relationships, flow activities matched to your skills, control over stressors, and a good balance of pleasures and gratifications are essential for a happy, meaningful life.

 

- Pleasure feels good in the moment but fades quickly, providing no lasting benefits. Gratifications, on the other hand, challenge us and make us grow. They often come from accomplishing something meaningful. 

- To find gratifications, know your strengths and engage in activities that use them. Studies show people experience longer-lasting happiness from kind acts and expressing gratitude than from indulging themselves.

- People often pursue happiness in misguided ways, like conspicuous consumption to signal status. This is a zero-sum game that reduces happiness for all. Inconspicuous consumption, like vacations and time with loved ones, provides more happiness. 

- Experiences tend to provide more happiness than material goods. They connect us to others, whereas objects often exist to impress others. Focus on experiences, relationships, and personal growth rather than status or accumulating possessions for the most happiness.

- To be happier, work less, earn less, want less, and spend more time engaging in meaningful activities with others. Stop trying to keep up with status-seekers and focus on the relationships and experiences that truly matter to you.

True happiness comes from meaningful pursuits and relationships, not pleasure or status. Make the most of life's gratifying moments with loved ones, express gratitude, use your strengths to help others, and avoid getting caught in the rat race of conspicuous consumption. Overall, live with purpose and connect with people - that is the path to happiness.

 

- The Chinese sage Lao Tzu warned against pursuing material goods and following what everyone else was doing. He said people should choose based on their feelings, not what they see. Unfortunately, this is not easy because our inner elephant wants to impress others and gain status. The elephant cares more about prestige than happiness.

- Modern life has many traps that lead us astray from happiness. One is the paradox of choice: we value having many choices but too much choice often makes us unsatisfied and less likely to choose anything. Another trap is conspicuous consumption - spending lots of money to signal our status. This is a zero-sum game that does not increase happiness. 

- The author initially thought Buddhism and its philosophy of detachment provided the best insights into happiness. However, doing more research, he concluded that this view may be an overreaction. Studies show that most people, even in impoverished circumstances, are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives. Happiness comes more from meaningful relationships and non-material sources.

- Detachment may have made more sense in Buddha's dangerous and unpredictable time. However, today, in wealthy democracies, long-term planning and stability are possible. Most people will live into old age and see their children survive. Loss and suffering, while inevitable, can often be endured and even lead to personal growth. 

- Given modern life's relative stability and prosperity, passionate attachment to people, goals and pleasures may be a better path to happiness than detachment. Life should be lived fully, despite the presence of some suffering. Many Western thinkers have concluded this, rather than advocating detachment like Buddha.

In summary, while Buddhism provides some valuable insights, its philosophy of detachment may be an overreaction based on the circumstances of Buddha's time. For most people today, meaningful relationships and life engagement are better paths to happiness than detachment. Suffering is inevitable but endurable, and should not prevent us from living fully.

 

- The philosopher Robert Solomon challenged the idea of nonattachment as contrary to human nature. He argued that emotions and passions are central to human life, even if they bring pain. 

- Solomon's view contrasts with ancient philosophers and spiritual leaders like Buddha who advocated avoiding passions and attachments to achieve tranquility. However, Solomon's view is consistent with romantic ideals emphasizing living life fully and passionately.

- The "happiness hypothesis" should incorporate both nonattachment and living passionately. We need Buddha's guidance for the internal work of nonattachment, but we also need guidance for living actively and developing loving relationships.

- Attachments to other people are essential for happiness. As the sayings go, "No one can live happily who has regard to himself alone" and "No man is an island." 

- Harry Harlow's research demonstrated the importance of attachments. His research on rhesus monkeys showed they have an innate drive for affection, nurturing, and social contact - not just rewards like food. Harlow found that baby monkeys preferred a soft, cloth "mother" over a wire "mother" that provided milk.

- Harlow's research challenged the prevailing views of psychoanalysis and behaviorism. Those theories viewed attachments as based primarily on rewards like feeding or libido, rather than affection. Harlow showed that the need for affection and nurturing is even more vital for monkeys than for food. 

- Harlow's research changed how orphanages and hospitals care for children. It showed that affection, touch, and emotional nurturing are essential for development - not just physical needs and rewards. His work helped end practices like isolating children to prevent disease transmission.

- In summary, research on monkeys and life experiences show that loving relationships and passions are vital for happiness and meaning, not something to avoid as some philosophies suggest. However, we still need guidance for balancing attachments with nonattachments.

 

- Harry Harlow conducted experiments showing that baby rhesus monkeys formed attachments to soft, cloth surrogate mothers rather than wire mothers that provided milk. This showed that affection and physical contact are essential for healthy development. 

- John Bowlby studied parent-child separation and developed attachment theory. He argued that children have an innate need for attachment to caregivers. This ensures their safety and healthy development.

- According to attachment theory, children have two main goals: safety and exploration. They regulate between these goals like a thermostat. They explore when they feel safe due to proximity to an attachment figure. When safety is threatened, they seek proximity to the attachment figure.

- The attachment figure, often the mother, provides a "secure base" that allows the child to explore the world, while ensuring a haven in times of distress. Attachment behaviors like crying, clinging, and following keep the child close to the attachment figure.

- Harlow and Bowlby provided evidence that affection, contact comfort, and attachment are essential for healthy social-emotional development in children and not secondary to biological needs like feeding. Their work challenged previous theories emphasizing reinforcement, drives, and psychosexual development.

- Attachment theory has dramatically influenced psychology, child development, and related fields. It provides a framework for understanding parent-child relationships, social development, and lifelong social functioning.

 

- John Bowlby proposed the theory of attachment, which states that infants form emotional bonds with their primary caregivers. These attachments are crucial for development and survival. 

- Harry Harlow's experiments with rhesus monkeys showed that infant monkeys become attached even to inanimate surrogate mothers that provide nourishment and comfort. This demonstrated the importance of emotional attachment, not just physical needs.

- Mary Ainsworth developed the "Strange Situation" experiment to observe infant-mother attachment styles. She found three main styles: secure, avoidant, and resistant. Securely attached infants explore freely but return to their mothers for comfort. Avoidant infants seem indifferent to their mothers. Resistant infants have trouble being soothed by their mothers.

- Attachment style is shaped by interactions over time, not a single factor. A child's temperament, a mother's responsiveness, and life events all contribute. While genes play some role,  environment and experience are also very influential.

- Attachment styles often persist into adulthood and shape romantic relationships. Secure adults find closeness easy, avoidant adults are uncomfortable with intimacy, and resistant adults crave extreme closeness that often scares partners away.

- In summary, our earliest emotional bonds with caregivers impact our ability to form close relationships throughout life. Both nurture and nature contribute to the development of attachment.

 

- Attachment relationships in infancy influence romantic relationships later in life. Securely attached infants tend to form secure attachments as adults, while insecurely attached infants tend to form insecure relationships as adults. These attachment patterns—secure, avoidant, and resistant—are relatively stable over a lifetime.  

- According to research by Hazan and colleagues, the four defining features of infant-parent attachment (proximity maintenance, separation distress, haven, and secure base) shift to romantic partners around the age of 15-17. This suggests that romantic partners become primary attachment figures like parents.

- Adult romantic relationships involve three interlocking systems: 

1) An attachment system that bonds infants to caregivers. This system persists into adulthood and applies to romantic partners.

2) A caregiving system that bonds caregivers to infants. In adults, this applies to the nurturing behaviors between romantic partners.

3) A mating system involving attraction and sex. Though separate from the other two systems, it works with them to motivate pair-bonding and reproduction in humans.

- Unlike other primates, humans have concealed ovulation and rely heavily on male parental care. This co-evolution of concealed ovulation, male parental care, and long-term pair-bonding was necessary to support the growth of large human brains. Human babies are born helpless and require heavy investment from both parents for many years. Evolution favored men who stayed to help raise children and guarded their mates' fidelity. 

- In summary, human romantic love builds on ancient attachment and caregiving systems that bond infants to parents. However, it also incorporates the human-specific mating system based on concealed ovulation and substantial male parental care. This interweaving of systems helps ensure that human children get the long and intensive biparental care they need.

 

- Romantic love involves the attachment system, the caregiving system, and the mating system in humans. These systems emerge at different stages of development but come together in romantic relationships.

- Two types of love: passionate love and companionate love.

- Passionate love is intense and feels like a drug. It activates dopamine responses in the brain, similar to cocaine and heroin. However, this feeling is temporary and fades over time as the brain builds tolerance. If someone believes in the myth of "true love" as eternal passion, the fading of passionate love can lead them to end a relationship wrongly. 

- Companionate love grows slowly through interdependence, caregiving, trust, and reliability. It is more stable than passionate love. 

- The paths of passionate love and companionate love diverge over time. Passionate love ignites quickly but fades, while companionate love builds slowly. This can lead to two danger points where people may need to correct mistakes: (1) committing to marriage during the height of passionate love and (2) ending a relationship when passionate love fades, not recognizing that companionate love has built or can still build.

- Most cultures and relationships have elements of both passionate and companionate love. Companionate love tends to endure longer but passionate love also recurs at times. A healthy relationship has some of both.

The key points are that two distinct types of love - passionate and companionate - follow different time courses. Recognizing this can help avoid inevitable mistakes and navigate relationships more wisely. Balancing passionate and companionate love may be necessary for a healthy long-term relationship.

 Here is a summary:

- Many philosophers and religious thinkers have been ambivalent about romantic love and passion. They value other kinds of love - love of God, love of virtue, love of humanity - but are suspicious of romantic love between two people.

- In ancient Eastern thought, passion and attachment were obstacles to Enlightenment and spiritual progress. Buddhism and Hinduism taught that attachments, especially sexual ones, must be broken. Confucius also saw romantic love as a threat to virtue and duty. 

- Greek and Roman philosophers tried redirecting passionate love toward more abstract objects like beauty, knowledge, and philosophy. Plato thought love of a particular person was degrading compared to love of beauty. The Stoics and Epicureans saw love as an improper attachment that made one's happiness dependent on another unpredictable person.

- Christianity valued the love of God and the love of neighbor but was suspicious of passionate romantic love. It promoted notions of caritas (goodwill and benevolence) and agape (selfless, spiritual love) instead of love focused on one person.

- There are several reasons for this philosophical discomfort with romantic love:

1) Love can make people act irrationally, and philosophy traditionally saw reason and rationality as the basis of morality.

2) Love attaches us to unpredictable, uncontrollable particular individuals, rather than to abstract ideals. 

3) Love can lead to ruin, as lovers make bad decisions in the grip of passion. 

4) Love challenges notions of self-sufficiency, making our happiness dependent on others.

In summary, while romantic love is a crucial human experience, it has long made philosophers uncomfortable because it is irrational, particular, uncontrollable, and threatens ideals of detachment and self-sufficiency. Real human love, focused on specific others, does not fit well with many philosophical visions. However, it remains essential for human well-being.

 Here is a summary:

The adversity hypothesis suggests that adversity, setbacks, and hardship can benefit people by strengthening them and facilitating personal growth. However, this is not always the case. Severe or traumatic adversity can be harmful and lead to conditions like PTSD. 

Research shows that moderate adversity, in the right circumstances and with the right mindset, can lead to "posttraumatic growth." This is the ability to find meaning and purpose after facing difficulties. Examples of posttraumatic growth include:

- Developing closer relationships and a greater appreciation of life 
- Identifying new life possibilities and pursuing more meaningful goals
- Gaining a greater sense of personal strength and resilience

For adversity to lead to growth, several factors are essential:

- The adversity must be severe enough to shake up a person's worldview and self-perception but not so devastating that it destroys them.
- A person must be able to craft a meaningful narrative or story to make sense of the adversity. 
- Social support is critical - adversity is most brutal to face alone. 
- A person must maintain an optimistic and resilient mindset and believe they can grow from the experience.

The story of Greg illustrates these principles. Though facing a traumatic loss, with time and the help of social support, Greg was able to find meaning, pursue new life goals, and gain resilience. His story shows how even devastating events can lead to personal growth.

In summary, the right kind of adversity, faced with courage and optimism, can strengthen us and help us reach our full potential. However, too much hardship or a lack of social support can break us instead of making us stronger. The key is maintaining a growth mindset through life's difficulties.

 

- Greg lost custody of his two children when his wife Amy took them and disappeared for two months. 

- This was an extremely stressful and traumatic experience for Greg. However, with the help of family, friends, and faith, he eventually rebuilt his life.

- Two years later, Greg found a new job and had his children back in his life, though he still felt wounded from the experience. However, he said the crisis had given him a new perspective on life and strengthened his relationships.

- Research shows that facing severe adversity, trauma, or loss can lead to "posttraumatic growth." People can benefit in three main ways:

1. Discovering hidden abilities and strengths, which boosts self-confidence. Survivors of trauma often feel inoculated against future stress.

2. Strengthening relationships. Adversity acts as a filter, clarifying who will offer real support. It can also open people's hearts to each other.

3. Changing priorities and philosophies. Facing mortality leads many people to live more in the present, value relationships over money or status, and become more forgiving and compassionate.

- The "adversity hypothesis" suggests that adversity causes suffering but can also lead to growth and joy. A "weak" version says adversity can lead to these benefits. A "strong" version says adversity may be necessary for moral and spiritual development. However, adversity should not be celebrated or prescribed.

- Examples like King Ashoka show how facing trauma like war can lead to a moral transformation and a more compassionate philosophy of life. Similarly, a health crisis like cancer often changes people's priorities and values relationships.

- In summary, while adversity usually brings suffering, it often also brings unforeseen benefits and opportunities for growth. The hardships we face can shape character and help us discover what matters in life.

 

The posttraumatic growth hypothesis states that people can grow psychologically after facing adversity. There are three levels at which this can happen:

1. Basic traits (the "big five" personality traits): These are relatively stable and shaped by genetics. Adversity is likely to stay the same. 

2. Characteristic adaptations include goals, values, and coping mechanisms. They are more malleable and shaped by life events. Adversity can prompt changes at this level as people adopt new goals and values.

3. Life story: The story we construct about our own lives. Adversity provides exciting material for life stories and can prompt radical revisions of one's life story. New stories that incorporate adversity in a redemptive way are associated with well-being.

The "weak" version of the posttraumatic growth hypothesis is that adversity can lead to growth for some people. This is well supported. The "strong" version is that adversity is necessary for optimal growth and development. This is more controversial.

There are reasons to believe the robust version may be valid:

1. Adversity prompts a reevaluation of life goals and priorities. It can shift people from pursuing success and achievement to pursuing relationships, religion, and helping others—which tends to increase well-being. 

2. Adversity provides material for a compelling life story. Stories of overcoming adversity or finding meaning in adversity are associated with well-being. Stories with little adversity tend to be uninteresting.

3. Adversity can prompt changes that increase "vertical coherence" between one's life story, goals, and essential traits. This coherence and integration is sign of well-being. Without adversity, one's goals and stories may not match one's essential traits.

In summary, while basic traits are hard to change, adversity can drive changes at the levels of goals, stories, and meaning-making that are important for well-being and personal growth. For this reason, the "strong" view of posttraumatic growth cannot be ruled out. Adversity may be necessary for optimal human flourishing in the right doses and with the right mindset. However, this is still a controversial claim.

 

Opportunities to grow from adversity are more available to some people than others. Optimists are more likely to benefit from adversity because they can easily sense adverse events and finders; anyone can become better at benefiting from adversity by developing optimism and sense-making skills. 

Three key steps can aid growth following adversity:

1. Cultivate an optimistic cognitive style through meditation, therapy, or medication. This makes negative rumination less likely and positive reappraisal more likely. 

2. Build solid social support networks. Trusted friends help people face threats and make sense of adversity. 

3. Religious faith and practice can foster sense-making and social support. Religions often provide narratives for understanding crises.

4. After facing adversity, write about your experience for 15 minutes a day over several days. Do not edit yourself; write without censoring your thoughts. This helps make sense of events and find benefits. Answer: why did this happen? What good can come of it?

While children and older adults may struggle more to grow from adversity, adults in their middle years are well-suited to benefit from difficulties. Their lives are stable enough to withstand challenges, but still open enough to learn and change their life stories. With effort and the right skills, people of all ages can benefit from the opportunity for growth that adversity provides.

 

- Childhood development depends on both genes and environment. A safe, nurturing environment helps children develop a positive outlook and secure attachment style. Adversity and threat during childhood can alter brain development, leading to less trust and more vigilance. 

- For most people in modern societies, optimism and approach motivation are beneficial. So for children, the most positive development within their genetic potential is usually best. Significant adversity during childhood often has few benefits. However, children are resilient and single events, even trauma, usually do not cause lasting damage. Chronic adversity is much more harmful. 

- Adolescence and early adulthood may be a sensitive period for benefiting from adversity. This is when people actively construct life stories and identities. Memories from ages 15-25 are particularly vivid and influential. Adversity during this time, especially if overcome, can strengthen development and lead to posttraumatic growth. 

- The sociologist Glen Elder found that how people respond to adversity depends on the interactions between individuals, groups, and events. Those with robust social support fare better. Adversity can provide a chance to find purpose and meaning. However, by the late 20s, life paths become more fixed. Adversity after age 30 is less likely to lead to resilience and growth.

- Wisdom depends on tacit knowledge gained from life experiences, not just explicit knowledge. Wise people balance their own needs with others' needs and long-term considerations. They balance adapting to environments, shaping environments, and selecting new environments. Suffering often cultivates wisdom and compassion. Sheltering children from adversity may limit their wisdom and growth. 

- For maximum benefit, adversity should happen at the right time, to those able to gain from it, and at the right degree. Each life is different, so there are no rigid rules. However, adversity in young adulthood, overcome through personal and social resources, generally yields the most positive effects. Adversity that causes PTSD, however, has few benefits. Moderation and context are key.

 

The passage discusses the virtues of the ancients, such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and others. These ancient cultures valued virtues such as honesty, justice, courage, benevolence, self-restraint, and respect for authority. They believed cultivating these virtues would lead to happiness and well-being. 

For example, an ancient Egyptian text called the Teaching of Amenemope instructs people to develop virtues like honesty, self-restraint, and contentment. It says it is better to earn little through honest work and have a happy heart than to gain wealth through wrongdoing and be vexed. The Greek philosopher Epicurus argued that living virtuously is impossible without living pleasantly. The Buddha similarly said that repeatedly doing good will fill one with joy.

Ben Franklin also believed in the virtue hypothesis - cultivating virtue would lead to happiness. He developed a program to train himself in 13 virtues by keeping track of his behavior and aiming to improve over time. Though imperfect, this program helped make him a happier and better man. 

While we cannot know if Franklin would have been less happy without this program, there are reasons to believe the virtue hypothesis may be true. Most cultures value similar virtues and believe they lead to well-being. However, the virtue hypothesis could also be confirmed cynically, such that appearing virtuous leads to success and happiness, not actual virtue.

In summary, the passage discusses how ancient and other cultures believed in the virtue hypothesis, that cultivating virtue would lead to happiness and success. Examples from Egyptian, Greek, Buddhist, and Franklin's teachings are used to illustrate this point, though there are also reasons to be skeptical of the virtue hypothesis.

 

- The ancient texts of many cultures, like the Bible, relied on maxims, role models, and habit formation to teach morality. They focused on cultivating virtue and practical wisdom. 

- Greek philosophy, while also focused on virtue, valued parsimony (finding the most straightforward explanation) and reason. These values ultimately led to the Enlightenment approaches of Kant and Bentham.

- Kant proposed the "categorical imperative" - that moral rules should be universalizable. He said we should consider whether the rules guiding our actions could be universally applied. This approach made ethics seem more logically confident.

- Bentham proposed utilitarianism - that we should aim for the maximum benefit for the maximum number of people. This approach evaluates actions based only on their consequences.

- Kant's deontological approach and Bentham's consequentialist approach dominated Western moral thinking. They value parsimony, reason, abstraction, and universal principles over particular contexts, emotions, intuitions, and habit.

- These Enlightenment approaches have contributed to political philosophy and unintendedly permeated the culture. They moved morality away from virtue, emphasizing rational calculation based on abstract rules and outcomes.

- The ancient approaches, focused on habit and intuition, cultivated moral skills and perception. The Enlightenment approaches aimed for logical certainty but lacked this cultivation of practical wisdom and virtue. A balance of these approaches may be needed for moral progress.

The passage outlines how Western moral thinking transitioned from an ancient virtue-based approach to a more rational, rule-based approach stemming from the Enlightenment. It argues that this transition brought benefits and drawbacks for further moral progress.

 

Modern philosophers and educators worked together to shift the focus of morality from character to moral dilemmas. Rather than ask what kind of person we should become, modern ethics focuses on whether particular actions are right or wrong in specific situations. This turn to "quandary ethics" has led to an emphasis on moral reasoning over virtue. If morality is about thinking through dilemmas, moral education should focus on teaching problem-solving skills. 

There are two main problems with this shift to quandary ethics and moral reasoning:

1. It weakens morality by limiting its scope. Morality becomes confined to a narrow set of situations where self-interest conflicts with the interests of others. Most of life is seen as outside the realm of morality. This makes the idea of virtue as self-interest paradoxical. In contrast, ethics focused on character and virtue sees moral concerns permeating life.

2. It relies on lousy psychology. Moral reasoning is the elephant's rider, but moral education has focused too much on training the rider. Simply teaching moral reasoning does little to change behavior and the elephant's habits and instincts. Moral emotions and intuitions are more potent for shaping conduct. 

An example shows how moral reasoning alone was not enough to change the author's eating habits, but experiencing disgust at seeing slaughterhouse footage led to becoming vegetarian for a time. Moral emotions provided the motivational force, even if moral reasoning had provided arguments for change.

Some efforts have been made to revive virtue ethics and character education to address these problems. Some philosophers argue that morality needs to be grounded in cultural traditions and frameworks of identity to be meaningful. Positive psychology also aimed to identify virtues and strengths to balance psychology's focus on pathology and problems. Developing a list of universal virtues and strengths was an early goal, though ultimately focused on virtues relevant to industrialized societies.

In summary, while moral reasoning and a focus on dilemmas have come to dominate modern ethics, there are good reasons to revive the study of virtue and character. Morality must be grounded in culture and human psychology to shape behavior powerfully. Virtue and character are also needed to give morality scope and meaning.

 

Researchers analyzed virtues and moral codes across significant world religions and secular philosophies. They found six broad virtue families that were common to most lists:

1. Wisdom (curiosity, judgment, perspective) 

2. Courage (valor, integrity, perseverance)

3. Humanity (kindness, love)

4. Justice (fairness, leadership, citizenship)

5. Temperance (humility, prudence, self-control)

6. Transcendence (beauty, gratitude, spirituality)

Rather than focus on weaknesses, people should develop their strengths and virtues. This can lead to a life of engagement, meaning, and flow—similar to Franklin's moral perfection. Cultivating virtues and strengths is often intrinsically rewarding.

However, virtue is not always rewarding or pleasurable. The real test is whether virtue and altruism benefit individuals even when acting against self-interest. Both religion and science offer unsatisfying easy answers to this question before providing more nuanced explanations.

For religion, the easy answer is divine or cosmic justice—God will reward the good and punish the wicked, whether in this life or an afterlife. However, belief in postmortem justice exhibits two signs of immature moral thinking: (1) immanent justice, where people think misfortune comes from past wrongdoing, even accidentally; and (2) the myth of pure evil, where people divide the world into good and evil. 

Mature religious and philosophical thinking moves beyond these easy answers to recognize virtue and morality as ends in themselves that benefit individuals and society. Psychological explanations for why altruism benefits well-being include social connection, meaning, self-worth, and health. In short, "virtue is its reward."

 

- Most people believe their actions are morally justified, so it is challenging to categorize most people as simply "good" or "evil".

- While altruism towards kin and reciprocity can explain some good behavior from an evolutionary perspective, this does not provide a satisfying guide for human morality and virtue.

- There is evidence that altruism and volunteer work can increase happiness and well-being, especially for the elderly. Helping others helps the self. 

- However, we have lost a shared sense of virtue and moral values in modern society. This loss of a shared ethos and constraints on behavior can lead to rootlessness, anxiety and antisocial behavior.

- Two factors contributing to the "death of character" are the rise of a culture focused on individual fulfillment over moral virtue, and increasing diversity leading to less shared moral values.

- A return to virtue and moral constraints may be beneficial for society. However, any efforts to promote character must be broad, given diversity.

- In summary, while there are benefits to individuals and society in promoting virtue and altruism, it is difficult to determine and promote a single set of moral values in diverse, modern cultures. However, some shared sense of virtue and constraint may help combat antisocial behavior.

 

The author argues that we understand the world through metaphors. The metaphor of "Flatland"—a two-dimensional world inhabited by geometric shapes—helps us understand morality, religion, and the human search for meaning. In Flatland, a sphere visits from a three-dimensional world and tries to explain the third dimension to a square, though the square struggles to understand.

The author argues that just as the sphere revealed the third dimension to the square, allowing him to see Flatland in a whole new way, religion and moral philosophy can reveal greater truths about meaning, value and purpose. However, these insights can be hard to grasp because we are accustomed to thinking in limited, familiar ways. The metaphor suggests we must open our minds to new possibilities to gain insight.

While the square was distressed to have his world upended, the insight ultimately expanded his understanding. Similarly, religious, moral and philosophical truths contradicting what we are used to can be unsettling but help us grow. The metaphor argues against close-mindedness and openness to ideas that challenge us.

The key argument is that we should avoid being limited or trapped in familiar, comfortable ways of thinking. We must strive to gain new perspectives and understand new dimensions of meaning to become enlightened, just as the square did when the sphere revealed the third dimension. Religion, morality and philosophy can help reveal these deeper dimensions if we open our minds to them.

 Here is a summary:

The passage discusses how humans perceive a third dimension in addition to the two apparent social dimensions of hierarchy and closeness. This third dimension is divinity, an innate sense of sacredness and morality. The author, as an atheist, is not claiming that God exists, just that humans seem predisposed to perceive divinity.

The author first noticed evidence for this third dimension in studying disgust. Disgust originally evolved to help humans choose safe foods, but it has expanded to become a guardian of the body more generally. Disgust turns off desire and motivates purification. Cultures often recruit disgust to support beliefs that elevate humans above animals, even though humans are animals biologically. Cultures insist that the human body is sacred, a "temple," even as the body engages in very animal functions.

The tension between human animality and beliefs in human sacredness creates taboos and rituals meant to separate humans from animals. These taboos and rituals allow people to perceive divinity and transcend their animal nature, at least symbolically. They give meaning and purpose beyond the biological.

The passage suggests that appreciating this third, moral/divine dimension is crucial to human flourishing. However, imposing one group's views of divinity on others can also be problematic. There is an argument for religious moderation and pluralism.

In summary, the key points are:

1) Humans perceive an innate sense of divinity/morality in addition to hierarchy and closeness. 
2) Disgust originally evolved to guide food choice but now also helps uphold cultural beliefs. 
3) Cultures insist humans are sacred but must confront human animality. 
4) Taboos and rituals emerge to transcend human animality and perceive divinity.
5) Recognition of the divine dimension is crucial but religious fundamentalism should be avoided.

 

- Cultures that deny our animal nature must go to great lengths to hide evidence of biological functions and processes. Disgust helps uphold standards of purity and cleanliness. 

- In a hypothetical town without norms of purity and cleanliness, people behave in disgusting and degrading ways, like having public sex, not bathing, and eating raw meat. This would make visitors feel disgusted and degraded.

- Disgust helps uphold the metaphor of the body as a "temple". It connects the earthly and divine, the biological and the spiritual. Puritan Cotton Mather felt disgust when he urinated simultaneously as a dog, showing how people sought to distinguish themselves from animals.

- Cultural psychologist Richard Shweder found that moral concepts can be grouped into three ethics: autonomy (individual rights), community (group loyalty), and divinity (purity). The ethic of divinity focuses on living in a pure, holy way.

- Ancient Hindu texts like The Laws of Manu set out rules for purity and avoiding disgusting things to maintain divinity and holiness. The material world is polluting, so one must follow the rules to avoid contamination.

- In interviews, the author found that Hindus in Bhubaneswar, India viewed purity and pollution rules as means for moral and spiritual advancement. Being pure allowed one to realize one's divinity. Impurity led to lousy karma and lower rebirth. 

- For Hindus, moral behavior, purity, and divinity are all linked. This view is not unique to Hinduism; Emerson expressed similar ideas.

- After leaving India, the author no longer had to focus as much on purity, pollution, or hierarchy. American university culture is relatively flat and egalitarian. Life seemed reduced to one dimension of closeness.

So in summary, the passage argues that cultures and moral systems that recognize human divinity also emphasize purity and pollution to help people achieve that divinity. Rules around disgust and the body help move people up a metaphorical vertical dimension toward the divine.

 

The author initially believed that one's actions should only be constrained by avoiding harm to others. However, after an experience living in India and gaining a new perspective, the author began to recognize glimpses of sacredness or divinity in the world. For example, the author adopted the Indian practice of removing shoes upon entering the home, viewing it as creating a sanctuary separate from the outside world. The author also noticed subtle feelings of discomfort upon witnessing "degrading" behavior in others, as if it brought the author down as well.

The author researched and found that notions of purity and pollution, as well as references to higher and lower levels of morality, were common in previous eras but have faded from public discourse. However, the author argues that intimations of sacredness still emerge even in secular society, in places, books, people and events that uplift and enlighten us. The author calls these "crypto-religious" experiences.

The author contemplated the opposite of disgust - the feeling of uplift upon witnessing virtuous acts or moral excellence in others. The author found little research on such an emotion and interrogated others, finding everyday experiences of warmth, openness or chills, often felt in the chest area. The author came across Thomas Jefferson's writings in which he described literature's ability to trigger emotions and motivate the reader to moral action through "dilation" of the chest and "elevated sentiments." The author recognized Jefferson's description as identifying an emotion - the opposite of disgust - triggered by witnessing virtue and eliciting motivation for moral behavior. The author considered naming this emotion "Jefferson's emotion" in his honor.

In summary, the author argues that while religious belief may be declining, experiences of the sacred persist. Though little studied, the emotion triggered by witnessing moral virtue is a human universal with significant prosocial effects. The author suggests that this emotion and related concepts were more openly recognized in previous eras, as evidenced in Jefferson's writings.

 

- For the past seven years, the author has studied "elevation" - the uplifting feeling people get when witnessing acts of moral beauty or virtue. 

- Elevation is different from admiration or happiness. It produces a warm, pleasant feeling in the chest and a desire to help others. It is a calming emotion, not associated with physiological arousal.

- Although people report wanting to do good deeds after feeling elevated, studies have not found a strong link between elevation and actual altruistic behavior. The author suggests this could be because elevation triggers the release of oxytocin, the "love hormone," which encourages bonding and attachment but not necessarily action.

- A study of lactating women found that those who watched an elevating video were likelier to nurse or play warmly with their babies, and leaked more milk - suggesting their oxytocin levels had increased. Elevation may fill people with love, trust, and openness to relationships.

- The author received a letter from a man describing "tears of compassion" from hearing of others' suffering, and "tears of celebration" from witnessing acts of moral courage or kindness. The latter are "tears of receptiveness to what is good in the world" and represent love "pouring in."

- The author, who grew up Jewish, has gained a new understanding of Christian references to Christ's love and love through Christ. Collective elevation during religious services at church can make people feel overflowing with love, which they may attribute to God or Christ. These experiences provide evidence for some that God resides within.

- In summary, elevation arises from witnessing moral beauty, triggers the release of oxytocin, fills us with feelings of love and connection, and for some is linked to an experience of the divine. Although it does not always lead directly to altruism, it expands our receptiveness to human goodness and spirituality.

 

- Once someone understands the "truth" of divinity, the ethical code of divinity becomes obvious. Some ways of living fit with divinity by bringing out our higher, nobler selves; others do not.

- The split between liberal and conservative Christians could be partly because some see tolerance and acceptance as part of their nobler selves; others feel they must change society and laws to match divinity, even imposing religious laws on others.

- Awe and transcendence, not just virtue, can move us along the third dimension of well-being. As Kant and others noted, the vastness and beauty of nature can lift the soul. 

- Transcendentalists saw nature as a way to know and worship God. Emerson felt a loss of ego and a sense of unity with the universe in nature.

- Anything that reduces the self can enable spiritual experience. Psychedelic drugs can induce feelings of contact with the divine and personal transformation. Set and setting are essential.

- In Pahnke's study, students on psilocybin during a Good Friday service reported mystical experiences and life-changing effects; placebo students did not.

- Awe happens when we perceive something vast beyond our mental structures, feel small and receptive, and often feel fear, admiration, elevation, or beauty. Awe enables change and conversion.

- The Bhagavad Gita shows a prototype of awe. Krishna gives Arjuna a cosmic vision, filling him with amazement, confusion, and fear. When it ends, Arjuna is ready to fulfill his dharma and fight.

 

The experience of Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita is an extreme example of a spiritual transformation, but many people have experiences that share some of the same elements. William James analyzed many such experiences and found they often involve a dissolution of the usually divided self and a feeling of unity and peace. People report that their old petty concerns and grasping attachments fall away, and they feel reborn with a profound sense of awe. After such an experience, people often feel less fearful and anxious, and more openhearted. 

Abraham Maslow called such experiences "peak experiences" and found they share many features, like a sense of unity, transcendence of the ego, and feelings of joy and gratitude. Maslow saw peak experiences as a naturalistic basis for religion. Religions start with the insights of peak experiences but often become rigid and rule-bound, losing touch with those origins. Maslow criticized science for also becoming sterile by separating facts from values and emotions. He founded humanistic psychology to study values and peak experiences.

Though evolutionarily advantageous, the human capacity for self-focused and self-reflective thinking also gave rise to a kind of torment. Constant thoughts about the self, especially unfavorable social comparisons and worries, cause distress and prevent spiritual insight. All major religions see the self as an obstacle, quieting excessive self-focus through meditation or transforming the self through discipline and self-denial. In a sense, the greedy egoistic self is like Satan. Overcoming excessive attachment to the self and its pleasures is central to spiritual and moral progress.

In summary, many people have profound spiritual experiences of unity that transform their sense of self and reduce distressing self-focus. Religions both emerge from such experiences and aim to cultivate them, but they often need to be more flexible institutions that maintain sight of this goal. While evolutionarily advantageous, the self poses challenges, and overcoming egoistic attachment to the self is central to spiritual and moral development in many traditions. Maslow and James saw such "peak" and "melting" experiences as revealing important psychological truths, even for secular thinkers.

 The critical points in the summary are:

1) After the 2004 U.S. presidential election, people in the "blue states" (who voted for John Kerry) had trouble understanding why people in the "red states" (who voted for George W. Bush) supported Bush and his policies.

2) The ethic of autonomy (which values individual freedom and rights) is contrasted with the ethic of divinity (which values living in accordance with religious or spiritual teachings). These ethics underlie many disagreements in the American "culture war."

3) Liberals want to maximize autonomy by removing limits and restrictions. Conservatives want society and policy to be guided more by religious and spiritual values. 

4) An extreme focus on either autonomy or divinity can be problematic. Autonomy taken too far can lead to a lack of meaning or purpose. An extreme focus on divinity can lead to mistreating groups seen as "impure" or not conforming to religious teachings.

5) Finding the right balance of autonomy and divinity may be crucial to happiness and meaning. Religious and spiritual practices may have insights from which even nonreligious people can learn.

So, in summary, the critical tension explored in this passage is between autonomy (individual freedom) and divinity (conforming to religious teachings). The author argues that both are important for happiness and meaning and that an extreme focus on one or the other can be problematic. Overall, a balance of these ethics may be ideal.
 
 

The author struggled with existential despair and meaninglessness during his senior year of high school. Though his life circumstances were good, he was obsessed with, "What is the meaning of life?" and felt nothing mattered in the grand scheme. 

He eventually found an answer that lifted his mood. He realized that if there is no God or external meaning, life is a gift to embrace rather than throw away. Though his interest in the meaning of life continued, he found philosophy needed more answers because it needed a deeper understanding of human nature. We can only determine what would make for a meaningful life by understanding human psychology and the kinds of beings we are.

The question "What is the meaning of life?" or the "Holy Question" is difficult to answer because it is unclear what answer could satisfy us. There are several kinds of meanings:

1) Definitional: The meaning of a word or concept. This does not apply to life itself. 

2) Symbolic: What something represents or stands for. However, life does not symbolize anything else. 

3) Help make sense of something, often by understanding intentions and beliefs. This is the meaning we seek in asking the Holy Question. We want enlightenment and an "aha!" experience.

There are two sub-questions people want to be answered:

1) The purpose of life: Why are we here? Either there is a creator with some intention or life arose by chance through natural processes. Religions often provide answers to this question.

2) The purpose within life: How should I live? What will make for a good, happy, and meaningful life? We want principles or goals to guide our choices and give them meaning.

So in summary, the Holy Question seeks to understand the meaning of life by gaining enlightenment into life's purpose and how to live well. The author argues that this can only be achieved by understanding human nature and psychology.

 

The author struggled with finding purpose and meaning in life as a teenager. He realized that the question of life's purpose (why are we here?) differs from the question of finding purpose within one's life (how can I live meaningfully?). The latter question is empirical and can be studied scientifically. 

Love and meaningful work are two essential conditions for human flourishing and happiness. Love provides social connections and relationships. Work satisfies the human need for competence, mastery, and making progress. 

Most people find work satisfying if it provides occupational self-direction - the freedom and opportunity to make complex decisions, learn, and pursue goals. Work can be seen as a "job" (just for money), a "career" (for advancement and prestige), or a "calling" (intrinsically motivating and meaningful). Callings are the most satisfying, but people in any occupation can find their work meaningful and experience flow by increasing their occupational self-direction.

Meaningful work contributes to happiness because it meets the basic human need for effectance - the drive to interact with and impact the environment. Effectance is an ongoing need, satisfied by making progress over time rather than achieving any particular end point. Meaningful work is a calling when it is inherently fulfilling and contributes to some greater good.

 

- People who saw their work as a calling and enjoyed it were generally happier than those who viewed it as merely a job. 
- Finding happiness and meaning in one's work involves connecting strengths and skills with work that taps into them. This can lead to experiences of "flow" and gratification.
- "Vital engagement" refers to a deep relationship with one's work that provides flow and meaning. It happens when there is a strong connection between oneself and one's work over time. 
- Vital engagement emerges from the relationship between a person and their work, not from either alone. It develops gradually through increasing commitment and meaning.
- The health of a profession depends on the alignment between doing good work and being rewarded for it. When high-quality, meaningful work is rewarded, a profession thrives. When it is, people can find vital engagement. 
- "Coherence" refers to a system whose parts fit together consistently and efficiently rent. Professions and worldviews function well, while incoherent ones do not. Aligning the levels of a system leads to coherence.

In summary, finding happiness and meaning in one's work comes from developing a coherent relationship between oneself, the work one does, and the surrounding system of values and rewards. Vital engagement emerges when there is alignment across these levels.

 

- Systems that can be analyzed at multiple levels can achieve "cross-level coherence" when the levels mesh together. This coherence leads to a sense of meaning and purpose. 

- People are multilevel systems: we have physical bodies, psychological minds, and exist within sociocultural environments. These levels were studied separately for much of history, but now interdisciplinary work is linking them.

- Cross-level coherence emerges when our physical experiences, conscious thoughts, and cultural environments align. This gives rise to a sense of meaning, as illustrated by Hindu rituals in India. Empty or contradictory rituals need this coherence and feel silly or purposeless.

- Religions are adept at creating cross-level coherence through tradition, bodily practices, and community. This gives followers a sense of purpose and connection. Nations can also provide coherence, but religion may be better suited, especially in diverse societies.

- Morality and religion are intertwined in all cultures. Although morality is about relationships and right action, it originates in religion. This is puzzling from an evolutionary perspective, since evolution favors self-interest. However, religion and morality helped human groups thrive, so they evolved via group selection.

- Meaning, purpose, morality, and religion stem from the human capacity to connect across experience levels. Finding coherence in life - between our physical being, mental lives, and social worlds - is critical to happiness and flourishing.

 

- Darwin proposed that groups compete and groups that sacrificed themselves for the common good would outcompete other groups. He thought features like altruism and patriotism would evolve at the group level. 

- However, simulations showed that altruism is vulnerable to free-riders, those who benefit from altruism but do not contribute. Kin selection and reciprocal altruism were proposed as solutions to this problem. Group selection was dismissed.

- An exception was made for eusocial insects like bees and ants that truly live and die as a group. For them, group selection was accepted. The question was whether group selection applied to humans.

- At first, most thought not. Although humans have cultural groups, individuals still pass on genes. Even in war, the coward who hides and survives is most likely to reproduce. So group selection was thought not to apply.

- But David Sloan Wilson argued this was an overreaction. Genetic and cultural evolution interact in humans. Cultural traits spread rapidly between groups, and evolution shapes brains to utilize culture. Genes and culture co-evolve.

- Wilson examines religion as an example. Religions bind groups and help solve coordination problems. Religious beliefs and practices that do so would spread culturally. Groups that developed more muscular belief systems and punished non-believers would do even better. So religious ideas and brains co-evolved. 

- Even if religious beliefs emerged accidentally, groups that used them to foster cooperation benefited. Religious beliefs, emotions, and social practices co-evolved with brains that responded to them.

In summary, while individual selection is still crucial for humans, cultural group selection likely also played a role, especially in shaping human religion and cooperation. Genes and culture have co-evolved in an intertwined process.

 

- Dean Hamer found evidence that a particular gene may be linked to tendencies toward religious and transcendent experiences. 

- Religion may have enhanced group selection in humans by promoting in-group cooperation. However, human nature also includes capacities for extreme selfishness. Culture and context determine which tendencies are expressed.

- David Sloan Wilson's book 'Darwin's Cathedral' provides an overarching perspective on the role of religion in human cultural evolution. Religious atrocities are often committed against outgroup members, consistent with group selection. Mysticism is a mechanism for transcending self-interest in favor of group interests.

- Andrew Newberg found that mystical experiences correlate with decreased activity in brain areas involthat locateself in space and perceive boundaries. Rituals involving repetitive movement and chanting may facilitate mystical experiences by inducing resonant brain states.

- William McNeill proposed that synchronized movement and chanting have been used throughout human history to generate in-group cohesion, harmony, and self-sacrifice. This is consistent with group selection.

- The key to a good, happy, and meaningful life is achieving the proper relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself.' Happiness emerges from cultivating coherence among different aspects of yourself, and integrating yourself with social and spiritual dimensions beyond yourself. 

- Progress requires balancing opposing forces, as reflected in ideas like yin and yang. Integrating opposing viewpoints and values is critical to human flourishing.

In summary, this passage argues that humans have innate tendencies toward selfishness and self-transcendence in the group's service. Culture, context, and practices like religion and ritual determine which tendencies are expressed. Individual happiness and social progress depend on balancing these opposing forces.

 

The author discusses the eternally shifting balance between opposing principles or ideas that are often seen as contradictory but in reality complement each other. For example, religion and science are usually considered opposites, but both provide insights into human nature. Similarly, the Eastern emphasis on acceptance and collectivism and the Western focus on striving and individualism both have value. A balanced perspective that incorporates both sides is most beneficial. 

The same complementary relationship exists between psychology and religion, liberal and conservative viewpoints, and selfishness and selflessness. Each side provides expertise in certain areas. A society dominated by more than one viewpoint would need more essential elements supplied by the other. By incorporating wisdom from multiple, even opposing sources - ancient and modern, science and religion, East and West, liberal and conservative - we can achieve happiness, meaning, and fulfillment.

The critical insight is that life's most profound truths are found not in absolutes but in balances - in the dynamic tension between opposites. The universe is built on a shifting equilibrium between destruction and creation, chaos and order. Staying in the balanced center, rather than tipping to an extreme, is the wisest perspective. However, balancing opposites requires acknowledging and learning from opposing viewpoints, not demonizing them. We can find insight even into opponents' ideas with an open and curious mind. By synthesizing wisdom from the full range of human experience, we gain a balanced view of life that leads to well-being.

The main message is to balance opposing principles and incorporate wisdom from diverse, even contrary sources. Achieving this balance and openness of mind is the key to happiness and meaning.

 

The author discusses studies on the benefits of meditation that used random assignment of participants to either a meditation or a control group. Such high-quality studies support the benefits mentioned. 

The author then provides many examples of benefits found in randomised studies of meditation, such as reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression, lower blood pressure, and decreased levels of stress hormones. However, the author notes that some review studies have found weaker effects, and more high-quality studies still need to be included.

The author discusses the work of psychologist Harry Harlow, who studied attachment and social deprivation in rhesus monkeys. Harlow found that young monkeys raised in isolation showed severe behavioral disturbances. Bowlby built on Harlow's work and others' to develop attachment theory, which states that forming close emotional bonds or attachments early in life is crucial for healthy development and well-being. Disruption of early attachments can have lasting negative consequences.

The author discusses how meditation and close social bonds are the most well-studied ways to increase well-being and resilience. While material wealth has a relatively small effect on happiness, relationships and experiences—both of which meditation fosters—significantly affect well-being. Meditation also changes the brain and body, increasing peacefulness, happiness, and resilience, even amid stress or loss. Social solid bonds have similar effects and benefits.

So in summary, the key benefits of meditation and social solid bonds discussed in the text, supported by high-quality research, are reduced depression and anxiety; lower stress and blood pressure; greater happiness, peace, and resilience; healthy brain and physiology; and overall increased well-being. These factors underscore why both practices are valuable for individual and societal health.
