• Whole Foods believes in limiting rules and bureaucracy for its teams but tracks and rewards team performance rigorously. 

• Whole Foods conducts monthly tours of each store and surprise inspections to evaluate over 300 measures of quality, service and morale. The results are posted for all stores to see to encourage accountability. 

• Whole Foods believes in being open and transparent. It shares strategic information, financial data and even salary details with all employees to build a high-trust culture. 

• Whole Foods’ team practices evolved over time through experimentation. Leadership kept what worked and dropped what didn’t. They knew they wanted to build a new kind of company but figured out the details over time.

• Most companies see teams as good but don’t design and manage them well. The most common mistakes are using a team when it’s not needed and failing to support teams properly.

• Just putting bright people on a team doesn’t guarantee good results. Careful thought must be given to team design, goals, and support systems. The organization as a whole must support teamwork.

• Even well-designed teams have downsides, like social loafing where some members don’t pull their weight. Metrics, rewards, feedback and selection can help minimize these problems.

• In summary, effective teamwork requires rigor, design, adaptation, and managing the inevitable downsides of teams. Done well, teams provide competitive advantage. Done poorly, they waste resources and sap motivation.

 

• Teams at Whole Foods are intensely accountable to each other for performance and results. While the culture emphasizes friendliness, the work environment is also very demanding. 

• Teams, when designed well, increase the pressure on members to deliver for the group. The desire to meet coworkers’ expectations can be more stressful than meeting managers’ demands.

• Pixar’s success depends heavily on its teams, not just its leaders. Teams require the right mix of skills, personalities, and chemistry to function well, especially on complex, long-term projects.

• Pixar’s teams are obsessed with producing great films that “touch the world.” This passion pushes people to extremes, which Pixar monitors to prevent burnout and other issues. Still, such motivation is essential for creating highly innovative work.

• Pixar believes getting the right team is key to getting the story right. The firm provides direct feedback and protects teams during the creative process but will replace directors if their teams lose confidence in them. 

• Signs of a struggling team at Pixar include lack of trust in the leader, rudeness, lack of commitment, and reduced meeting attendance or engagement. Pixar will replace directors when teams are no longer gelling, even midproject.

• While replacing directors is common in film, Pixar is particularly attuned to team dynamics and sees directors’ abilities to lead their teams as central to a film’s success or failure. When teams fail to come together, Pixar acts quickly to make a change.

 

- Pixar sees itself as a “filmmaker-led” company that is more supportive and trusting of its people than typical movie studios. 
- Pixar’s willingness to fire underperforming employees is remarkable given the close relationships within the company. Many early hires were friends who shared a passion for filmmaking. 
- An example of Pixar’s supportive culture is how John Lasseter, a top leader, drove with a director to help fix story issues for a film. This shows the level of commitment to helping each other succeed. 
- However, Pixar will remove people, even friends, to make a great film. One person said Pixar struggles with being honest about this. The culture is supportive but always puts story above people. 
- Academics distinguish between “communal” relationships, based on mutual support, and “exchange” relationships, based on reciprocity. Most see businesses as exchange relationships. 
- However, cutting-edge firms blend exchange and communal relationships. Historically, families and some businesses combined these. Firms like Patagonia build community through efforts like on-site daycare. 
- Blending these relationships is complicated. Greater expectations of communal support lead to more disappointment when it’s lacking. Pixar risks this in creating a family environment yet firing when needed. But for Pixar, close bonds enable great films. 
- Whole Foods and Pixar value teams more than typical firms. They see firms as collections of teams, not individuals. They want passionate, culture-fitting talent and build team chemistry. 
- Though seen as “soft” cultures, both have rigorous processes. They provide feedback and expect teams to address issues. Leaders are especially likely to be removed if teams struggle.

 

Cutting-edge firms employ innovative approaches to developing high-performing teams. They understand the potential of teams and are willing to experiment. The author calls the teams within these firms “extreme teams” because they utilize bold new approaches beyond those found in conventional firms. 

The author selected seven firms to profile based on:
1) A track record of significant growth and financial success, even in adversity. 
2) A willingness to experiment with new team approaches.

These firms include Whole Foods, Pixar, Zappos, Airbnb, Patagonia, Netflix, and Alibaba. Each has outmaneuvered larger competitors to become leaders in their industries.

Extreme teams share the following practices:

1. Fostering a shared obsession. Members share a passionate belief in their work and firm. They see themselves as unique and destined to improve the world. They have faith in overcoming adversity. Conventional teams view work as tasks to professionally complete, lacking shared passion.

2. Valuing fit over experience. Extreme teams value the traits needed to achieve goals. They develop approaches to ensure members have the right motives, values, and temperament. They hire and promote based on culture fit. Conventional teams select based on experience and skills.

3. Focusing more, then less. Extreme teams relentlessly focus on vital priorities, dedicating most time to them and avoiding distractions. But they also explore new opportunities. Conventional teams focus on many priorities and are easily distracted.

4. Pushing harder, pushing softer. Extreme teams are simultaneously harder and softer. They drive measurable results but also foster collaboration, trust, and loyalty. Conventional teams are “beige,” failing to push either side.

5. Taking comfort in discomfort. Extreme teams favor conflict, believing it yields better outcomes. They take on challenges and risks. Conventional teams avoid conflict and view it as failure.  

In summary, conventional teams view work as a job, value experience, pursue many priorities, strive for efficiency, value harmony, and avoid discomfort. Extreme teams view work as a calling, value fit, focus on priorities, are both hard and soft, value conflict, and take on challenges.

The author acknowledges other firms could be used to illustrate extreme teams. The selected firms are meant as examples of innovative team approaches.

 

- Netflix has become the world’s leader in streaming media by taking big risks and outmaneuvering established competitors like Blockbuster. 

- Netflix is also bold in its approach to people management. Its culture presentation, called the "Netflix culture deck," outlines its operating principles and has been widely influential.

- Netflix believes that only teams willing to take big risks will achieve great success. It gives teams wide autonomy and expects them to operate like professional sports teams, where underperforming members are cut. 

- Netflix believes team results are more important than individual relationships. Team members are expected to challenge each other and address poor performance, even if it causes discomfort.

- Netflix's culture focuses on hiring highly aligned team members, setting clear priorities, reinforcing a culture that is both supportive and demanding, and encouraging discomfort and conflict in the service of the team's goals.

- The Netflix approach is high risk and won't work for every firm. But its willingness to experiment with team dynamics and break from conventional practices offers important lessons for other companies. Success depends on understanding the rationale behind Netflix's practices and determining how and whether to apply them in a different organizational context.

- No company or team is without flaws, and external factors like new technologies or competitive challenges can undermine even the most innovative firms. The real test of a company's success is its ability to withstand the challenges that inevitably come its way.

 Here is a summary of the responsibility culture at Netflix:

• Netflix gives employees a high degree of autonomy and freedom but also holds them to very high standards of performance. It works to reinforce the autonomy its people have, for example, by eliminating policies like tracking vacation days. 

• The key to making this model work is having the right people—those with the motivation, skills, and mindset to thrive with a high degree of responsibility and deliver strong results. Netflix works hard to recruit and retain only extraordinary talent.

• Netflix developed its culture deck to clearly communicate its high-performance culture to candidates and new hires. The culture is not for everyone, and the firm wants people to know what to expect. The deck helps reduce the chances of new hires feeling like the firm engaged in a “bait and switch.”

• Netflix uses the term “talent density” to refer to the level of skill and ability within its workforce. It aims for a very high level of talent density, filled with people who can perform at an extraordinary level. It believes most firms suffer from the opposite—a low talent density—which becomes more pronounced as companies grow.

• Netflix avoids putting processes before people. It gives employees a lot of latitude in how they work and aims to minimize administrative requirements. It surrounds people with very talented peers, which it sees as the best perk it can offer. 

• Netflix is relentless about upgrading talent. It believes the output of an extraordinary employee is 10 times that of an average employee. It will fire not just underperformers but those who are merely average. Performance and results are what matter—not effort or intent.

• Netflix's focus on talent impacts all of its people practices. For example, it recently introduced a generous paid sabbatical for new parents to attract and retain top talent. It also communicates its high expectations for performance clearly from the first day of orientation. Employees know that if they fail to perform, they will be let go quickly.

• Two traits that define Netflix's culture are a focus on future needs over current conditions and a willingness to make tough decisions to advance the firm. Netflix was planning for streaming while still focused on DVDs, planning to produce original content while still a distributor, and planning international expansion while building a U.S. presence. Its leaders ask what the firm needs to keep growing and make decisions focused on the long term.

 

Netflix managers are focused on building high-performing teams that can deliver results. They regularly assess what skills they need on their teams and make changes as needed, even if it means letting some team members go. The company values future potential over past contributions. Those who cannot contribute to future goals are often released, even if they performed well in the past. 

Releasing employees who do not meet expectations is difficult for many reasons:

1. Performance is hard to assess, especially average performance. 
2. Managers care about their employees and don't want to hurt them.
3. Legal issues can arise if the reasons for release are not properly documented. 
4. Managers often think they can improve employee performance through coaching.

To overcome these obstacles, Netflix offers generous severance packages to employees they release to make the process as painless as possible. The goal is to part on good terms.

While Netflix strives for a high-performance culture, they aim to avoid becoming too harsh. Pushing too aggressively for results can undermine the culture.

Amazon is another company focused on performance and long-term thinking but has been criticized for a harsh culture. Issues include:

1. Employees work extremely long hours, even during time off, leading to high stress and health issues. 
2. Extensive monitoring and metrics are used to assess performance, putting pressure on employees. Those who cannot keep up are often fired or quit.
3. A focus on frugality and cost-cutting has led to some poor working conditions, like lack of air conditioning in warehouses. 
4. The culture is described as highly political, with constant reorganizations creating uncertainty. 
5. The CEO is portrayed as a demanding leader who pushes for the highest standards and can be very critical of others.

While Amazon's culture has fueled their success and innovation, their treatment of employees has been widely criticized. There is an ongoing debate about how to build a high-performance culture sustainably.

 

Amazon is an extremely successful company by traditional measures like revenue, profit, and stock price growth. However, its aggressive and demanding culture has been criticized. The debate around Amazon's culture highlights a key question: What constitutes success for a company or team beyond results?

Results are typically defined as meeting financial and growth targets as well as customer expectations. But success is broader than that. For some companies like Patagonia and Whole Foods, success also means advancing their mission and purpose. Patagonia shifted to organic cotton even though it hurt profits because environmentalism is central to its mission. 

Success also means building organizational capabilities to sustain results over the long term. This includes developing individual team members, hiring the right talent, and improving how teams and companies operate. Amazon's culture and practices aim to push for maximum efficiency, productivity, and results. Critics argue this comes at the cost of employee well-being and sustainability. Supporters counter that Amazon's culture is key to its success and innovation.

The example of Amazon shows that there is no consensus on how to balance results, purpose, and capability building. Success depends on the priorities and values of a company's leaders and employees. For some, maximum productivity and results are most important. For others, organizational purpose and sustainability are also crucial. Defining the right balance is an open debate.

 

- Teams develop processes to enable their success. Pixar, for example, provides feedback to help teams improve. Success requires continuous improvements in team capabilities, functioning and environment.  

- For some, teams exist solely to produce results. Relationships are a means to an end.  Steve Jobs focused on results over relationships. However, Jony Ives said relationships were key to success and he was most proud of his team. Relationships and results are both important.

- Social capital refers to relationships that enable groups and organizations to function. It encourages helping others beyond self-interest. Examples include donating to food banks and Silicon Valley networks. Social capital can be accumulated and used when needed, helping teams overcome challenges. It increases the likelihood of success.

- Soldiers fight primarily for each other, not abstract causes. Stronger ties mean more willingness to take risks. A study found loyalty to comrades was most significant in determining a soldier's willingness to fight. 

- Employee engagement correlates with having a best friend at work. Those with work friends were more positive and reported more praise, feeling of importance, opinion counting and using their strengths. Though seemingly absurd, it indicates the importance of social capital.

- There are two types of social capital:

Bonding: Connections within a group, e.g. Whole Foods teams, Pixar teams. 

Bridging: Connections across groups, e.g. product and manufacturing teams collaborating. Pixar values interconnectedness across the company.

- In summary, social capital in the form of relationships and connections is key to team and organizational success. Both results and relationships are important. Strong social capital helps teams overcome challenges and increases the likelihood of success.

 

- People at Pixar use the expression “good hallway” to underscore the importance of connecting with coworkers. It means acknowledging and engaging with people as you pass them in the halls. Pixar believes this builds community and helps with success. 

- There are three types of social capital:

1. Bonding - Relationships among team members. Feeling connected to share a goal. More than just liking each other. 

2. Building - Relationships with other teams. Requires personal awareness and investment. Success depends on relationships within and outside the team.

3. Believing - Connection to the organization. Emotional investment in the company and leaders. Belief that the organization shares your values.

- Social capital is often seen as less important than results but is necessary for sustained success. It’s hard to measure and manage but provides benefits like an engaged workforce. Providing community at work may become an obligation to meet human needs.

- A results/relationships model shows that people judge groups on competence (ability to achieve outcomes) and warmth (supportiveness). Warmth is assessed first. Teams are likely judged this way too - first, is it a warm place to work? Second, can it deliver results?

- An example is a product team that launched a successful new smartphone but then fell apart due to lack of social capital. Distrust, isolation, and lack of belief in leadership caused the team to disband after the launch. Despite initial success, lack of relationships undermined sustained results.

 

- A study by Teresa Amabile and colleagues examined the factors that enable high performance in organizations. They focused on the role of helping behavior. 

- They surveyed people at the design firm IDEO and asked them to identify colleagues who were most helpful to them. They rated these "helpers" on competence, trustworthiness, and accessibility. They also rated randomly selected non-helpers.

- The results showed that trustworthiness and accessibility were most important in determining who was viewed as helpful. Competence mattered but was not the primary driver.

- Results and relationships are both important for team success. However, too much emphasis on either one can be detrimental.

- An excessive focus on results can lead to:

1) Burnout and reduced well-being of team members. The example of Pixar's Toy Story team was given. 

2) Unethical behavior as people feel pressure to achieve results at any cost. The Volkswagen emissions scandal and issues at Valeant Pharmaceuticals were used as examples.

- Strong interpersonal relationships and cohesion can also lead to negative outcomes like:

1) Groupthink where alternative perspectives are not considered. 

2) Avoidance of difficult issues to preserve harmony. A study of travel agents showed very strong or very weak social ties can hurt performance.

3) Loyalty to the group that discourages confronting problems. People don't want to disrupt social relations or be seen as disloyal.

4) Creation of "in-groups" and "out-groups" that can alienate others needed for success. Strong bonds within a team can lead to viewing others as outsiders.

- In summary, results and relationships must be balanced. Too much of either one can undermine individual well-being and team performance. The key is achieving a focus on results built on a foundation of high-quality relationships.

 

- Teams need to achieve results to meet performance expectations and build capabilities. They also need to build relationships to enable collaboration and commitment. 
- Too much focus on results can lead to burnout, bruising culture, and a results-at-any-cost mentality. Too much focus on relationships can lead to groupthink, avoidance of tough issues, and in-group/out-group dynamics.
- Teams face two main risks: pushing results or relationships to an extreme, or not pushing them far enough (equilibrium trap). The best teams push both results and relationships to the limit, then manage the downsides. 
- Cutting-edge teams ask what they would do if only results mattered or if only relationships mattered. They create a productive tension between results and relationships. 
- Pushing extremes, when done skillfully, creates virtuous cycles where results enhance relationships and vice versa. The goal is to create virtuous team cycles of ever-improving performance.

The key takeaway is that teams must focus on both results and relationships to succeed. An extreme focus on one or the other is problematic. The most effective teams are able to push both results and relationships to the limit, creating a productive tension that leads to virtuous cycles of performance. Managing this dynamic is key to team success.

 

- Yvon Chouinard, the founder of Patagonia, is passionate about the environment. He built Patagonia to support environmental causes and inspire others to live sustainably. 

- Patagonia's two priorities are: 1) reducing harm to the environment, and 2) making high-quality products. Chouinard believes these priorities are linked. The company wants people to buy fewer, longer-lasting products.

- Patagonia donates 1% of revenue to environmental groups and gives employees paid time off to volunteer. The company once ran an ad telling people not to buy one of its popular jackets to encourage less consumption. 

- Some argue that a business's only purpose is to maximize profits for shareholders. However, many successful companies are dedicated to broader goals, like improving nutrition, creating happiness, or fostering community. They aim to profit while also serving other priorities.

- Zappos illustrates this. Its goal is creating happiness through service. It trains staff to fully engage callers and meet their needs. Zappos does not focus on efficiency metrics or upselling. The CEO says Zappos's priority is not selling shoes but serving others. A story shows staff helping find pizza for executives after hours. 

- In summary, an excessive focus on either results or relationships can undermine the other. Successful teams find an equilibrium but also push the edges. Patagonia and Zappos show how companies can balance profits and purpose. They foster a shared obsession beyond just business results.

 

- Cutting-edge companies like Zappos, Pixar, and Whole Foods are paradoxically profitable because they care more about purpose and quality than money. 
- These companies have quasi-religious cultures centered around shared beliefs in a greater purpose beyond profits. Employees are deeply committed to these purposes. 
- The companies view themselves as special and superior in their goals and abilities. They often have origin stories that reinforce their values and expected behaviors.
- The companies can seem cult-like, especially when led by charismatic founders like Tony Hsieh (Zappos), John Mackey (Whole Foods), or Ed Catmull (Pixar). However, they differ from cults because their ideals are tested in the market and they benefit society. 
- Cutting-edge companies need “obsessive” employees who are fully immersed in and committed to the work and purpose. While this level of obsession may seem unhealthy, it drives extreme results and relationships.
- The key challenge for these companies is to maintain their idealism and push boundaries without becoming completely detached from business realities like attracting customers and earning profits. They must be “cult-like without becoming a cult.”

In summary, cutting-edge companies are able to achieve extreme results and build close-knit relationships because they cultivate quasi-religious cultures and attract obsessively committed employees. However, they must continue meeting business objectives and benefiting society to avoid becoming detached cults. The key is finding the right balance of idealism and pragmatism.

 

Obsession, often viewed negatively, is essential for extreme success. Visionary leaders and cutting-edge firms are obsessed with their work and mission.

- Obsession describes the extreme drive and relentless focus of visionary leaders and teams. It is an abnormal level of commitment that leads to extraordinary outcomes.  

- Obsession comes in three forms:
1. An obsession with the work itself and the resulting product. People are fixated on the work they do; it is central to their identity. They work to satisfy their own standards, not those of customers or shareholders. They believe if they produce something they love, others will as well.

2. A willingness to perseveringly focus on tasks over a long time. People will obsess over details and get things right through extreme focus and commitment.  

3. An obsession with the company's purpose and mission. People are consumed with contributing to the achievement of something they believe in. 

- Obsession at an individual and team level leads to success. Visionary leaders catalyze obsession, but teams also collectively work in an obsessive manner. Groundbreaking products come from small, intense teams obsessed with what they are creating.

- Obsession also works at a company level. Cutting-edge firms are populated by “true believers” consumed by the company mission and fully committed to contributing to its achievement.

- There are risks to obsessive behavior like health issues and work-life balance challenges. But obsession is different from workaholism or addiction. Obsessed people find meaning and enjoyment in their work.

- Most view obsession as an individual trait, but it also applies to teams and companies. Leaders catalyze it, but groups can work collectively in an obsessive way.

In summary, obsession in various forms is required for the extreme success of visionary leaders, cutting-edge teams, and firms. But it needs to be balanced and harnessed to avoid potential downsides. When combined with talent, it leads to extraordinary outcomes.

 

Obsession is a key attribute of cutting-edge firms and their leaders. They pursue goals with an intensity that 
others might not. Three characteristics define their obsession:

1. An unrelenting focus on the work. Cutting-edge teams are consumed with getting the details of their 
products and services right. For example, Walt Disney remained obsessed with improving the quality of 
his films even decades after their release.

2. An emotional investment in building a great company culture. Leaders like Tony Hsieh of Zappos are 
passionate about creating an environment that people want to be part of. They reject practices like hiring 
temporary workers that might compromise their cultures.

3. A desire to have an impact on society. Leaders like Whole Foods' CEO want to "change the world" through
their companies and products. Research shows that people who view their work as serving a higher purpose tend
to be more satisfied and dedicated.

Leaders and companies that combine all three obsessions—an intense focus on the work, building a strong internal 
culture, and benefitting society—are most likely to thrive. Obsession gives companies the drive and perseverance to
overcome obstacles and achieve audacious goals. But obsession must be balanced with a sense of purpose beyond 
self-interest. The most successful leaders and companies are "gritty" —they have a steadfast commitment to big 
missions and the resilience to achieve them.

In summary, cutting-edge firms are obsessed in a way that makes them uniquely able to change the world. But their 
obsession is not narrow or self-centered. Rather, it reflects a balanced and socially-minded form of passion that fuels 
their success.

 

- Most companies prioritize a candidate’s capabilities and skills over their fit with the organization’s culture. However, companies with a strong unique culture, like Zappos, emphasize cultural fit. 
- Zappos has an extensive hiring process that focuses on determining if candidates match their values and culture. They accept that this process can take a long time and negatively impact short-term results. But they believe sustaining their culture is most important.
- Zappos starts by having candidates engage with company ambassadors to assess fit. They then conduct capability interviews with the hiring manager and HR interviews focused specifically on cultural fit. They evaluate candidates 50% on skills and 50% on fit. 
- Zappos has interview questions for each of their 10 core values to assess fit. For example, they ask about delivering outstanding service and embracing fun and weirdness. They also observe how candidates interact with others when visiting the office. 
- Zappos requires all new hires, regardless of level, to complete a 4-week training focused on their values. They then make “The Offer” - offering $2,000 for new hires to quit to ensure they are fully committed. Only 2% take the offer. 
- Strong, unique cultures demand a focus on fit. Zappos initially only hired friends of the founders to embed their culture. Cutting-edge firms hire for fit over skills alone.

The key takeaway is that companies with a powerful culture tend to value cultural fit over capabilities or skills alone when hiring. They invest heavily in assessing fit and ensuring new hires embrace their values. While this process may take longer and impact short-term results, embedding the right culture is essential to their success. For these companies, fit trumps skills.

 

• Cutting-edge firms and teams hire based primarily on cultural fit. They believe skills and talent can be taught but passion and mindset are innate. 
• A leader’s key role is hiring the right people who will work together to achieve desired outcomes. Assessing people’s capabilities and potential, and how they will collaboratively work, is an art form that varies in effectiveness across leaders.
• There are risks to focusing more on resumes than cultural fit:
› Those who don’t buy into the culture are less likely to fully contribute and commit to success. 
› Those who don’t fit the culture can become toxic and negatively influence others.  
› Those who don’t fit the culture are more likely to hire others who also don’t fit, and tolerate problematic behaviors.
› Those at odds with the culture may not effectively operate within it and accomplish what’s needed. 
• Cultural fit is especially important in initial hires, who set the tone and disproportionately impact the emerging culture. Carefully selecting first hires helps ensure they embody the desired culture.  
• However, too much focus on cultural fit over skills and talent can mean failing to hire or promote necessary capabilities. Most groups seek threshold talent before considering cultural fit, but face compromises when needing world-class talent. Cutting-edge firms are less likely to compromise on culture.

• Examples of cutting-edge firms that hire primarily based on cultural fit and passion include Patagonia, Netflix, Airbnb, and Zappos. Their cultures emphasize things like environmentalism, talent, customer experience, and happiness. Leaders in these companies personally hire to ensure candidates are “all in.”

 

Companies may overlook a candidate's poor culture fit because of their impressive skills and capabilities. However, focusing too much on culture fit can lead to a lack of diversity in thinking and hiring people who match a narrow definition of an ideal employee. The most innovative companies:

1. Focus on hiring people who share the company's core values and purpose. For example, Pixar looks for people committed to storytelling and teamwork. 

2.Embrace diversity in backgrounds, thinking styles, and approaches. Pixar deliberately hires people who will challenge the status quo. They hire highly creative people but require they work well in teams.

3. Remove poor cultural fits, even if they are highly talented. Pixar gets rid of "socially dysfunctional" people who cannot work well with others.

4. Define a limited set of meaningful, specific values that reflect the company's mission. Generic values like integrity are not helpful. Pixar's key values are storytelling and teamwork.

5. Articulate values in terms of expected behaviors. For example, Pixar's value of teamwork means "talk to anyone you like without permission."

6. Link values to objectives, rewards, and consequences. Cutting-edge companies reward and punish based on how people live the values. 

7. Ensure leadership and practices reflect the stated values. Enron claimed integrity as a value but acted unethically. Promoting people who violate key values undermines a culture.

8. Determine the single most important cultural value to prioritize in hiring. For Patagonia, it is hiring "dirt bags" committed to the environment. For Pixar, it is hiring storytellers. For Zappos, it is hiring people who love serving customers.

9. Attract like-minded talent by having a clear purpose and identity. People seek out companies like Whole Foods that have strong values and a mission they believe in.

 

- Airbnb began less than a decade ago with two founders renting out a room in their apartment. 

- Their idea was to help people rent out unused space in their homes to strangers via the Internet.

- This was an audacious idea that has since allowed Airbnb to become the world’s largest peer-to-peer lodging company.

- Airbnb now has more rooms than Marriott and Hilton combined and hosted its 100 millionth guest in 2016.

- The company started as Airbed & Breakfast, named after the air mattresses in that first rental.

- The key challenge for the founders was to figure out what not to do and stay focused on their big idea. They had to avoid distraction and tangents.

The key point is that the founders had to maintain focus on their innovative idea in order for Airbnb to become as successful as it did. They had to determine what was most important and avoid getting distracted or going off on tangents. Staying focused on the essentials was key.

 

- In its early years, Airbnb focused on survival and short-term objectives. As it grew, it developed an annual operating plan with many priorities which created confusion. 
- Airbnb then simplified to four main priorities summarized on one page. This was hard but focusing on a few vital priorities is key. Having too many priorities is like having none. 
- Airbnb cascades these top priorities throughout the company so everyone understands them. But teams then determine how best to achieve them based on their areas. This empowers teams while aligning them.
- Airbnb's role is not to dictate how teams work but to provide context on priorities and ensure accountability. Teams set their own goals and ways of working. Managers help teams get resources and overcome obstacles. 
- Providing context on why priorities matter involves clarifying the business environment, how money is made, key customers, products, competitors, success measures, strategic plans, key capabilities, values and expected behaviors. Often even leadership teams lack alignment on these.
- Two challenges in building global teams are lack of clarity on priorities and poor communication of strategic direction. Airbnb works to address these through simplifying and cascading priorities with context.

So in summary, as Airbnb grew very rapidly, it learned the importance of simplifying to a few key strategic priorities, communicating those priorities throughout the organization with context, and then empowering teams to determine how best to achieve those priorities in their areas while still holding them accountable. This alignment plus empowerment has been key to their success.

 

- Teams need to gain clarity on their objectives and ensure individual members' goals are aligned. This requires clearly communicating the context in which the team is operating. 
- If people in an organization can't articulate the key objectives and strategies, the context has likely not been well communicated. 
- Netflix believes context setting is key to its success and freedom/responsibility culture. When done well, context allows people to make good decisions and priorities. When lacking, people may make foolish choices.
- Setting context is not dictating outcomes or what people should do. It provides the information for people to make good decisions. 
- Netflix aims for a "highly aligned but loosely coupled" organization. People agree on the environment and goals but have freedom in how they achieve them. 
- Netflix started emphasizing context after nearly going bankrupt early on due to overly ambitious spending before revenue growth caught up. They had weekly metrics meetings to ensure everyone understood the company's financial situation.
- Context setting is ongoing as business environments change. Many leaders fail to re-communicate context or lack patience to help others understand changes. 
- Teams need to identify a few key priorities to focus on. Some teams get distracted by less important things or try to do too much, failing to focus on the vital priorities. 
- Distractions include lower-value priorities, unnecessary administrative work, too many meetings, and political issues. Team leaders should protect their teams from distractions.
- Pushing people to achieve more and more priorities often undermines focus on the truly critical areas. Overly complex priorities also make focus difficult. Simplicity in priorities is key.

 

•Clear and simple priorities are key. Having too many priorities or complex ones confuse people and diminish impact. 

•Priorities should have clear outcomes and success metrics. Outcome measures specify the desired end result while process measures describe activities. Outcome measures are better.

•Involving people in developing priorities and metrics helps ensure buy-in and linkage to context. But avoid too many metrics.

•Accountability and authority need to be clear. Assigning individual owners for priorities provides a single point of accountability but collective responsibility remains. Clarify the authority of owners.

•Regular progress reviews are important. Reviews promote transparency, discussion of performance, and course corrections. Scorecards with color coding can help but focus should be on discussion not just reporting scores.

•Relentless focus on key priorities is needed. Say no to distracting peripheral activities. Make tough choices to ensure focus like Netflix ending executive team attendance of DVD vice presidents.

•Balance focus with experimentation. Continually enhance core business but also try new things to learn and adapt. Airbnb founders experimented with high-quality photos and found them key to reducing guest anxiety.

•Summary: Keep it simple. Focus on key measurable outcomes. Involve people but avoid metric overload. Assign clear accountability and authority. Review progress regularly focusing on discussion. Focus relentlessly but also experiment. Balance enhancing core business with adapting to the new.

 

- Airbnb improves its customer experience through incremental innovations based on a “seven-star design process.” It asks teams to imagine how to improve the experience to get six-, seven-, eight- or nine-star ratings. Most ideas are unrealistic but encourage outside-the-box thinking. 
- Like other leading firms, Airbnb and Netflix rely on experimentation. Most experiments fail but some succeed and are scaled up. The challenge is balancing focus and innovation.
- Airbnb’s CEO encourages envisioning competitors that could undermine Airbnb’s business model. This pushes innovation to stay ahead of rivals. 
- Pixar avoids repeating itself. It hires outsiders to bring in new perspectives. The goal is embracing “natural dissenters” who point out opportunities and blind spots. 
- Whole Foods gives store teams autonomy to incrementally innovate. One team opened an in-store wine bar, now in over 75 stores. Another team created a health program for other companies’ employees.  
- Netflix teams have autonomy and responsibility for innovations like releasing all episodes of House of Cards at once, enabling binge watching. 
- Google’s “20% time” lets engineers spend work time on personal projects, fueling creativity and significant advances. But time use is not monitored or required, and some abuse it. The key is balancing autonomy and accountability.

In summary, leading innovative firms rely on pushing the boundaries of their business models through experimentation, bringing in outside perspectives, empowering teams and individuals, and balancing autonomy and accountability. Continuous incremental improvements and occasional bigger innovations have fueled the success of companies like Airbnb, Pixar, Whole Foods, Netflix and Google.

 

- Cutting-edge firms embrace contradictions and have aspects of both a hard and soft culture. A hard culture emphasizes performance targets, disciplined practices and accountability. A soft culture emphasizes strong social bonds, creativity and informality. Most firms favor one over the other.  

- Culture refers to the beliefs, assumptions and feelings that people in an organization share. It influences how people think, feel and behave. Cutting-edge firms focus on creating a positive emotional experience and connection.  

- For example, Pixar believes that storytelling is key to making great films that move people emotionally. Starbucks aims to provide an experience that makes customers feel like they belong. Airbnb also focuses on creating a sense of belonging - for both guests using their service and employees within the organization.  

- Howard Schultz and Starbucks emphasize that they are in the people business, not just the coffee business. Schultz believes emotional connection is their true value. Airbnb works to build trust between guests and hosts and a sense of community within their own organization.  

- Cutting-edge firms that get culture right are able to embrace contradictions. They push for results but also support people. They plan rigorously but also encourage experimentation. They demand excellence but also accept mistakes. This is challenging to achieve but defines high-performing teams and organizations.

 

- Airbnb focuses on creating memorable experiences for its customers, employees, and hosts. 
- It examines every point of interaction that employees have with the company and works to improve their experience. For example, its hiring process provides regular updates to applicants and an offer to provide feedback for those not selected.
- Its headquarters is designed to enhance the employee experience. People can work anywhere, and conference rooms are replicas of Airbnb rentals around the world. The company provides many benefits to employees, including free meals, ability to bring dogs to work, and $2,000 per year to stay in Airbnb rentals. 
- Airbnb’s focus on experience has made it a top place to work. Its CEO has a 97% approval rating from employees. 
- A company’s culture is based on a combination of what people think and how they feel. Cutting-edge companies focus heavily on shaping positive emotions and experiences. 
- Managing negative emotions is also important. Pixar, for example, creates psychological safety so teams feel comfortable experimenting, even though it could lead to failure. 
- Culture provides a competitive advantage because it’s hard to replicate. Competitors can’t simply mandate a new culture. Building and sustaining the right culture requires effort, time, and commitment.
- Culture change is challenging because culture evolves from what worked in the past and is often taken for granted. One size does not fit all—each company needs cultural norms tailored to its needs.

 

- Pixar and Patagonia have very different approaches to work hours and work-life balance. Pixar has an open office policy where employees can work any hours they want. Patagonia, in contrast, closes its office at 8 pm every night and on weekends to encourage employees to recharge. There is no one right approach, and it depends on a company's culture and values. 

- Disney Animation struggled for years until Disney acquired Pixar in 2006 and put Pixar's leaders in charge. They took time to assess the issues at Disney Animation and decided to keep the studios separate while selectively applying lessons from Pixar's success. They replaced executives who lacked passion for animation, formed a "Brain Trust" to review films in progress, and revamped the work environment to encourage more creativity.

- Cutting-edge companies believe they have unique cultures but also share some similarities, like embracing passion for the work, accountability, creativity, and community. The specific cultural themes of companies like Alibaba, Airbnb, Netflix, Patagonia, Pixar, Whole Foods, and Zappos reflect these attributes in different ways.

- Airbnb aims to make work meaningful for employees through focusing on purpose and social impact, giving employees flexibility and input into their projects, and creating a highly supportive work environment and culture. Patagonia also focuses on purpose over growth and aims to build a company that can last 100 years by operating sustainably.

 

Patagonia, an outdoor apparel and gear company, recently sponsored a study on the environmental impact of synthetic fibers used in their fleece jackets. The study found that microplastics shed from fleece can pollute waterways. Patagonia is making the findings public and working to find solutions. They also run a program encouraging people to repair and recycle their clothes.  

Whole Foods gives local stores and teams a lot of autonomy to make decisions to best serve customers. Many innovations started as local experiments, like wine bars, kombucha bars, spas, and putting greens. Whole Foods is also making larger changes to attract new customers, like inviting outside vendors into some stores and lowering prices.

Netflix also gives employees a lot of autonomy and trusts them to get the job done. They aim to have as little bureaucracy and as few rules as possible. For example, they got rid of reporting vacation time, detailed expense guidelines, and performance reviews. They believe the most talented people want autonomy and independence. 

Whole Foods and Netflix are also very transparent. Whole Foods shares performance data and decision reasons with all employees. Netflix is direct in communication about the state of the company and next steps. New hires know that people who don't perform will be let go.

Netflix holds people fully accountable for results. Effort and hard work don't matter if performance isn't there. They hire people who will thrive in their culture and remove those who won't. Zappos also emphasizes accountability, especially for customer service. They track metrics like call times, emotional connections, and customer reviews.

Alibaba and Zappos have playful, quirky cultures. Alibaba's CEO, Jack Ma, wants people to take on kung fu nicknames and performs in costumes at company events. Zappos thinks playfulness and weirdness are good for business. For example, they have parades, costume contests, and team outings. The cultures at these companies aim for fun, creativity, and connection between employees.

 

The company Zappos sponsors many celebratory events to boost employee happiness and strong workplace culture. Over several months, Zappos held: 
- A St. Patrick’s Day contest for best kilt and green beer
- A pie-eating contest on Pi Day
- A concert featuring the band Mercy Music
- A day off for employees on Leap Day to pursue their bucket lists; the CEO officiated two employees’ wedding 
- A Chinese New Year festival with singing, blessings, and performances

These events aim to build a sense of community and strong bonds between employees. The leaders of cutting-edge companies like Zappos, Whole Foods, and Patagonia tend to be playful and engage in fun activities themselves.

Building community is key to Pixar’s success. Employees fully support each other, feel like “one for all and all for one.” Pixar’s building design facilitates interactions between employees of different teams. Anyone can share ideas with anyone else without going through a chain of command. 

Zappos also focuses on building community and views itself as a “family.” Employees are required to come into the office instead of working remotely so they can build closer relationships. Managers spend up to 20% of their time socializing with team members outside of work. Zappos uses technology like the “Face Game” to help employees get to know each other.  

Cutting-edge companies establish a distinctive culture by first defining the attributes and emotions they want, then developing mechanisms to reinforce them. Members understand expectations and values. These companies continually examine their own culture and work to improve it. The key lesson is to question your own culture and commit to strengthening it.

 

- Alibaba secretly developed an auction website to compete with eBay, a much larger competitor. Jack Ma selected six people to work in secret on this project. 

- Alibaba defeated eBay in China after several years. eBay spent $250 million but eventually withdrew from China. Alibaba went on to become China’s largest e-commerce company.

- Key to Alibaba’s success was hiring entrepreneurial people with resilience, hiring people below the top students, and promoting intense debate and conflict in the company. Ma believes conflict produces good outcomes. 

- Most companies avoid open conflict in meetings and believe it signals trouble. They focus on politeness and team cohesion over outcomes. Alibaba differs in promoting open conflict and debate.

- Sociologist Erving Goffman proposed that people act to “save face” in groups by supporting each other’s self-image and roles. Challenging others can threaten face and group membership. Most companies follow norms of politeness to enable face saving.

- Ursula Burns wanted to reduce face saving at Xerox to encourage directness and boost revenue growth. She saw face saving as patience with poor performance. Reducing face saving required rebuilding trust to allow direct feedback.

The key lessons are:

1) Hiring entrepreneurial and resilient people, and promoting debate, conflict, and intensity can drive high performance. 

2) Most companies follow norms of politeness and face saving that inhibit directness and harm outcomes. Reducing face saving is difficult but can improve performance. 

3) Rebuilding trust and psychological safety is required to allow direct feedback in groups focused on face saving. Promoting conflict requires ensuring people feel valued despite the conflict.

4)Alibaba’s success shows that promoting productive conflict and intensity, when combined with trust in the group, can achieve extraordinary results that more conventional approaches may miss.

 

- Burns wanted Xerox employees to be more direct in expressing their views, even if critical, because she saw them as like a family. She felt they avoided conflict at times due to “terminal niceness” from working together for so long.

- Some avoid conflict to avoid embarrassment if proven wrong or lack of support. Or they remain silent until they know where others stand. Some just tell leaders what they want to hear.

- Holbrook said people often avoid real differences in meetings, then work at cross-purposes later. Leaders sometimes say they want openness but really want agreement. At Xerox, long relationships led to avoiding challenging others, especially in meetings.

-Bird said “passive-aggressive” people who undermine the team poison it. But managing conflict is complex. Members get conflicting messages:

1) Express your honest views or you don’t add value. 
2) Be collaborative or you’re not a team player.

- This “double-bind” causes confusion and inaction. The goals can be compatible but it’s hard. The key is redefining “comfort” as accepting discomfort. Pixar wants to “shake things up” and argue but will change if convinced. 

- Most say they value conflict but avoiding the pain is hard. Cutting-edge firms raise the “pain threshold” and “heat” in interactions. They make people “comfortable with discomfort.” Airbnb aimed to encourage open talk by promoting “productive discomfort.”

The key is a culture where people feel safe surfacing hard issues, and where conflict is viewed as necessary and even positive, not personal. The goal is the best outcome, not comfort. But this is challenging and imperfect. Still, it is key to continued learning and progress.

 

The key points are:
1. Teams need to surface the “elephants, dead fish and vomit” - the undiscussables, unresolved past issues and concerns that need to be addressed. This helps bring issues out in the open and injects humor into uncomfortable conversations. 

2. Separating ideas from people helps reduce defensiveness. Though in reality, ideas are personal, the goal should be focusing on the best solution, not defending one’s position. Pixar’s CEO emphasizes critiquing the work, not the people.

3. Setting audacious goals inevitably leads to conflict, which is necessary for creativity. Pixar’s films often face challenges that halt production, showing conflict is inevitable. Teams know they must meet high standards or face consequences.  

4. Focusing on the vital few issues that really matter prevents wasting time on unimportant conflicts. Leaders must guide teams to the key challenges.

5. Productive conflict requires:
- Accepting the discomfort of conflict 
- Pursuing bold goals that create healthy tension
- Focusing on the most critical issues 
- Having the skills and temperament for productive debate

6. Techniques like brainstorming, “rounds” where people take turns sharing views, and pre-considering options in writing can help teams benefit from everyone’s input. But more than generating ideas is needed.

7. Teams need to have a “good fight” - expressing views directly but also collaborating to find the best solution. Being assertive yet collaborative avoids a “double bind.”

Key fields of conflict that enable productive debate are:

1. Task conflict - Conflict over ideas, choices and approaches to work. This boosts creativity and solutions.

2. Process conflict - Conflict over how to get work done and make decisions.Clarifying this improves team functioning. 

3. Relationship conflict - Interpersonal tensions and annoyances. This undermines teamwork and should be minimized.

Focusing conflict on tasks and process while reducing relationship conflict results in the most effective teams. But any conflict needs a balance of both collaboration and assertiveness.

 

- Debate and conflict are necessary to generate and improve new ideas. 
- Research shows that groups encouraged to debate ideas generated 25% more ideas than groups using traditional brainstorming techniques. 
- Pixar uses several techniques to promote productive debate and conflict:

1) Daily reviews where animators get feedback on their work. This feedback can be harsh but helps improve the work. 
2) “Notes” sessions where senior leaders review film progress and provide suggestions for improvement. Participants are expected to “plus” the work by providing constructive feedback and specific ideas for improvement.
3) Postmortems after film completion to review what worked and didn’t work and make changes for the next film. For example, a postmortem revealed that production staff felt like “second-class citizens” so changes were made to address this.

- Productive conflict requires social and emotional skills to minimize damage to relationships. Research shows teams with higher “social sensitivity” and ability to read emotions of others performed better on problem-solving tasks.

- “Psychological safety” - a sense of confidence that you won’t be embarrassed or punished for speaking up - is key to team effectiveness and innovation. Research by Amy Edmondson and Google found that psychologically safe teams had the best results. However, psychological safety must be balanced with a focus on demanding goals and outcomes.   

- The most effective teams are able to be “comfortable with being uncomfortable”. They understand that growth requires tension and conflict, and deliberately create challenges to avoid stagnation. For example, Yvon Chouinard of Patagonia believes that discomfort and daunting challenges have led to the company’s best performance.  

- In summary, the most innovative companies and effective teams embrace debate and conflict, have skills to navigate it productively, and are willing to push outside their comfort zone in pursuit of meaningful goals. “Terminal niceness” and avoiding discomfort lead to stagnation. Effective teams strike a balance of psychological safety and ambition.

 

• Companies like Netflix, Airbnb, and Alibaba are disrupting traditional industries through innovative business models and products. However, their leaders realize long-term success requires building innovative organizations and workplaces. 

• Leaders are motivated to create new types of organizations that match their values and personalities. They don’t fit well in typical large companies. 

• Pushing results and relationships to the extreme can lead to unintended consequences like harsh culture or unethical practices. The challenge is driving innovation while managing the downsides.

• Conventional firms face risks like settling for mediocrity or overfocusing on either results or relationships. They tend to replicate what worked in the past and avoid new approaches.

• Studies show leaders and teams perceived as strong in both results and relationships are the most effective. Extremes teams push both to the limit.

• Building a new extreme team requires:

› A compelling purpose and mission to attract dedicated members
› Hiring for cultural fit and attributes beyond just skills 
› Fluid structures and processes to enable innovation
› A willingness to take risks and fail
› Ongoing feedback and development 
› Autonomy and empowerment

• Challenges include managing tensions between new and existing teams, providing the right balance of support and pressure, and ensuring alignment.

• Effective team leadership requires managing the paradoxes of driving results and relationships, providing vision and empowerment, and embracing continuity and change.

 

To effectively screen team members, develop an approach to assess candidates on:

- Their alignment with the team’s purpose and values. Look for examples of the desired attributes and traits in their background and behavior.

- Their fit with the team culture you want to create. Assess if their work style and preferences match the experiences you aim to provide to members.

- Their skills and abilities to achieve the team’s priorities. Evaluate if they have the technical and soft skills required for the team to be successful.

- Their willingness to commit to the team’s accountabilities and ways of working. Determine if they will follow the practices and norms established for the team.

In screening, be rigorous but also look for passion and fit. Technical skills alone will not determine a candidate’s ability to operate effectively on a team. Group culture and dynamics are equally, if not more, important.

 

- Pixar's team was talented but producing uninspiring films that were failing commercially and creatively. The question was why talented, committed people produce mediocre work contradictory to their values. Leaders should look for contradictions in teams and address them. 

- Teams fail for many reasons, including:

1) Lack of clear purpose or mundane purpose that does not motivate 
2) Lack of necessary talent and skills 
3) Unclear priorities or too many priorities 
4) Flawed decision making and inability to address conflicts
5) Problematic culture that is hard to change

- Turning around teams requires bold moves, like promoting junior members with desired traits to model new behaviors. But teams need autonomy and support to succeed.

- While processes are necessary for large companies, too much bureaucracy and control can limit teams. Companies want effective, compliant teams that don't threaten the status quo. 

- Teams can threaten leaders who then undermine the teams to protect their power. Leaders may see talented team members as threats.

- In summary, the key reasons for team failure are lack of purpose, talent, priorities; poor decision making and culture; and too much control and threat to leaders. Turnarounds require giving good teams autonomy and support, while boldly shaping culture. But team success also requires addressing how teams can threaten company processes and leaders.

 

- Leaders who are highly motivated by power may undermine their teams to preserve their position and authority. A study found that “power hungry” leaders separated talented team members or limited communication between them when they felt their power was at risk. Not all leaders act this way, but those with a strong need for power may put their authority over team success. 

- Teams offer advantages like creativity and productivity that are hard to copy. However, they require giving up control, which organizations and leaders often resist. Team members may also resist the responsibility that comes with autonomy. Despite voicing support for teams, many lack the commitment to make them work.

- Nearly all major achievements come from small groups working together. Leaders select and motivate team members to achieve ambitious goals. Though leaders get accolades, teams do the work and meet people’s need to bond over pursuing a larger purpose. An example is bomber crews in WWII who formed lifelong bonds.

- The author thanks many who studied teams, including J. Richard Hackman who spent decades observing them. The book was also inspired by the importance of entrepreneurial leadership in building great teams, and the pioneer Robert Bales who studied task vs. social behaviors in teams. Other influences include Amy Edmondson, Jon Katzenbach, David Nadler, and Ruth Wageman. 

- The author thanks clients, colleagues, his editor, daughter and brother for their help and support.

In summary, teams have significant advantages but also challenges. When leaders are able to overcome their desire for control and commit to empowering teams, and when team members are able to take on responsibility, teams can achieve greatly. But "power hungry" leaders may undermine their teams to preserve their power, limiting what teams can accomplish. With the right leadership and talent, teams are able to do what individuals cannot.

 

- Getting the team right is necessary to get the ideas right. Having smart people is important but how they work together matters most. Even talented people can be ineffective together if they are mismatched. Focus on team performance, not individual talents. A good team has people who complement each other.

- Pixar’s CEO says they will support a director fully until the crew says they will not follow that person. They aim to be “director led” but that means the director must actually lead. They can tell if a director is not leading by seeing if the crew is not following.

- A team is more than just coworkers. At Zappos, they see themselves as a family that looks out for each other, cares for each other, and goes above and beyond for each other because they believe in and trust each other. They work and play together. 

- Netflix aims for radical transparency and radical candor in communication. They put their culture principles in writing to promote debate on following them and to clarify them. Their unlimited leave policy for new parents aims to build loyalty and trust. However, their culture also has been described as promoting “fear” and constant “experimentation.” They have let go of about 1,000 people without any lawsuits.

- Amazon also has a demanding culture with high expectations for performance and achievement. Their workplace has been described as “bruising” where people must grapple with big ideas. Staffers at Facebook and Amazon report the highest stress levels.

- A positive team and family spirit is key to Zappos’ unique culture. They go beyond typical coworker relationships.

- While aiming for a higher purpose, companies like Airbnb, Alibaba, and Whole Foods also have their critics. No company is free of controversy.

- Success requires risking going too far to see how far you can go. Netflix started by selling DVDs, quickly switched to rentals, and grew massively. Blockbuster went bankrupt facing competition from the much smaller Netflix.  Netflix now dominates Internet traffic.

 

- Amazon uses technology to monitor employee productivity and discipline workers for “time theft.” While criticized, other companies like Walmart use similar practices. 
- Although some reviews of Amazon’s work culture are negative, Amazon says most feedback is positive. 
- Amazon has grown tremendously in revenue and stock price since its founding. 
- Teams need a shared purpose, satisfy clients, improve over time, and have satisfied members. 
- Leaders at Patagonia, Whole Foods, and Apple are obsessed with product quality and design. 
- Social cohesion and camaraderie can improve group performance and motivation. Lacking connection can reduce effectiveness.
- Emotional culture involves feelings about group values and norms. It impacts a group’s cohesion and performance.
- Troubled companies may fail to change their cultures even after recognizing the need to do so.  
- Too much group cohesion can reduce critical thinking and lead to poor decision making. But some tension between task and relationships is optimal.
- Empathy has limits in organizational settings. Excessive collaboration and citizenship behaviors can lead to burnout, especially for women. 
- “Polarity management” involves leveraging the upsides of opposites like control and flexibility. Extremes should be balanced.
- Removing underperforming team members too quickly can undermine trust and morale for those who remain. But waiting too long also has costs. 
- Teams need both task-oriented and process-oriented members. The former focus on solutions and the latter on group functioning.

In summary, group culture is complex but crucial for effectiveness and performance. Optimal cultures balance a shared purpose with critical thinking, task orientation with relationships, and stability with change. Extremes often need to be managed for the best outcomes. But establishing and maintaining a productive culture is challenging work that requires insight and care.

 Here is a summary of the sources:

- Yvon Chouinard, the founder of Patagonia, is obsessed with product quality and environmental sustainability. Patagonia generates about $750 million in annual revenue but growth is not Chouinard’s primary focus. He aims to make high-quality goods and reduce environmental impact. 

- Chouinard believes that high-quality goods, good customer service, excellent workplace environment, workforce well-being, and environmental sustainability are all linked. If any part is missing, the whole system breaks down. 

- Some critics argue that Patagonia’s focus on social mission over profits is misguided. However, Chouinard and supporters counter that the approach creates a highly motivated workforce and brand loyalty.

- Other companies with a strong sense of purpose beyond just profits include Pixar, Zappos, and Airbnb. For example, Pixar aims to make creative, innovative films, not just profitable sequels. Zappos aims to provide excellent customer service and company culture. Airbnb aims to enable more human connections via home sharing.

- Successful startup founders are often motivated by a desire to improve the world, not just make money. While the motivation may be idealistic, it leads to genuinely loving their companies and sticking with them for the long haul. 

- Some employees view their work as a calling, not just a job or career. When managers support employees in finding meaning and purpose, the employees tend to be more engaged and productive.

- Visionary leaders like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, and Richard Branson are obsessed with their companies and missions. While the obsession is not always healthy, it is linked to their success and ability to persevere against odds.

The summary outlines how a sense of purpose beyond profits, especially improving the world in some way, leads companies and leaders to make a bigger impact. The success stories of Patagonia, Pixar, Zappos, Airbnb, and startup founders highlight how a mission-driven approach can foster motivation, innovation, loyalty, and longevity.

 

- Employees who felt their managers at KPMG talked positively about the firm’s impact and meaning were more likely to view it as a great place to work and less likely to look for a new job.
- Leaders like Steve Jobs who aim to make a dent in the universe and talk about meaningful work inspire employees. 
- Research by Angela Duckworth and others shows that grit, passion and perseverance are key factors in success. People who demonstrate grit are able to sustain motivation and effort over long periods despite challenges or setbacks.

- Companies should hire based on value fit over skills or capabilities. People can be trained for jobs but values are harder to impart. Values-based hiring helps sustain culture.  
- As companies grow, it's hard to preserve culture. Leaders need to clearly and frequently communicate company values and model them through actions and hiring. They should hire "missionaries" over "mercenaries."
- While some diversity of thought is good, too much can reduce group cohesion and comfort. Moderate friction from differences can boost performance but extremes are counterproductive. 
-Company values should be limited (around 5-10) and prioritized so they can be clearly understood and remembered. Unclear or conflicting values are less effective.
- New leaders and employees should be evaluated for culture fit to make sure they share and will sustain key values. Mis-hires can be toxic and damage culture.

- In early stages, companies should focus on a few key priorities to gain traction. As they grow, they need to maintain focus through deliberation and discipline, but also become open to new opportunities. Striking the right balance between focus and flexibility is key to success. 

- Airbnb started very focused but then expanded into other types of travel experiences.  Maintaining focus on community and trust allowed them to venture into new areas without losing their way. Clear purpose and alignment around values and mission guide expansion.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the selected passages:

Airbnb and Netflix focused on survival in their early years. Airbnb's CEO believes in simplifying objectives so they can fit on one page. Airbnb emphasizes employee experience and creating a sense of belonging. Netflix has a culture deck that articulates its approach. 

These companies have shared objectives and priorities to build an "in group." Airbnb cascades clear goals through the organization. Healthy debate is encouraged. At Netflix, employees are asked how the company would be different if they were CEO. Pixar's Ed Catmull believes in not repeating what works. Google's 20% time encourages innovation.

There are hard and soft edges to culture. Hard edges provide clarity and alignment, including values, priorities, and accountability. Soft edges relate to feelings and relationships. Starbucks pushed soft edges like emotional connections after returning to its roots. Culture includes beliefs, feelings, and climate. Strong cultures have consistency; weak ones have variation.

Some ways to strengthen culture are: hire for cultural fit, earn awards that reflect culture, appeal to the personal lives of employees, practice positive behaviors, communicate constantly, and be authentic and vulnerable.

 Here is a summary of the article:

The researchers analyzed group performance on a variety of problem-solving tasks. They found evidence for a collective intelligence factor, which they labeled “c,” that predicted a group’s performance on these tasks. Groups with a higher c tended to perform better, even when controlling for the intelligence of individual group members. The c factor seemed to capture properties of group interaction, rather than just the sum of members’ abilities.

The key findings were:

1) A collective intelligence factor (c) exists for groups that predicts performance on a variety of tasks. This is separate from the intelligence of individual group members. 

2) Groups with a higher c tended to perform better on problem-solving tasks. This relationship held even when controlling for the intelligence of individual members.

3) The c factor captures properties of group interaction and dynamics, not just the sum of members' abilities. Things like member consistency, emotional intelligence, and equal distribution of conversational turn-taking were correlated with higher c.

4) Group cohesion, motivation, and satisfaction did not correlate with higher c or better problem-solving performance. So good group dynamics are more important than just members liking each other or being motivated.

The study provides evidence that collective intelligence is an emergent property of groups that depends on the interactions between group members. Harnessing the power of collective intelligence may provide benefits for teams and organizations. The researchers suggest focusing on recruiting group members with high social perceptiveness, creating an environment where all members feel safe to contribute, and developing good turn-taking and cohesion in group discussions.

In summary, this study found collective intelligence to be an important factor determining group performance. This intelligence arises from complex interactions between group members and is correlated with measurable properties of effective group collaboration. Understanding and enhancing the collective intelligence of teams may have significant benefits for real-world organizations.

 Here’s a summary:

- Diversity is an inescapable reality in today’s world. Globalization and immigration mean people from diverse backgrounds are everywhere.

- 36% of the U.S. workforce is people of color. By 2040, there will be no ethnic majority in the U.S. Similar trends are happening in other countries.

- Diversity brings opportunities and challenges. The key question is how to optimize the opportunities of diversity.

- Physical environments can be designed to foster creativity by bringing together diverse perspectives. 

- Learning to see from different perspectives, including those of customers, is key. This includes building trust and cohesive teams across differences.

- New ideas can emerge from diverse teams. The key is selecting and developing the most promising ideas. 

- Ideas need to be designed and tested to work for a range of diverse users.

- Conflicts are inevitable in diverse groups but can be defused. The focus should be on building understanding and synergy across differences.

- Leaders and organizations need to develop the capacity for cultural intelligence to navigate diversity and drive innovation. This includes creating a culture where diverse perspectives are valued and nurtured.

- When leveraged effectively, diversity can be a key driver of creativity, innovation, and business success. The alternative is stagnation.

That covers the essence of the key arguments and recommendations around diversity and innovation in this sample from Driven by Difference. The central message is that diversity is an inescapable fact, and the key question is how to optimize its opportunities, especially around creativity and innovation. Nurturing and combining diverse perspectives in the right way is key to that.

Does this help summarize the key highlights? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 

• Diversity refers to differences in culture, ethnicity, gender, generations, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and more. 

• The most culturally diverse countries are in Africa, like Chad, Nigeria, and Congo. The most diverse cities are Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, Toronto, and San Francisco.

• There are many types of diversity, but visible diversity and underrepresentation have the biggest impact on workplace dynamics. Visible diversity refers to differences that can be readily observed, like ethnicity, gender, age, and disability. Underrepresentation refers to groups that make up less than 15% of the total, which can highlight their differences.

• What matters most is not the source of diversity but the different values and perspectives that emerge from it. More diversity means more approaches to communicating, planning, and problem solving.

• Aligning the values and work styles of diverse groups is key to innovation. Cultural intelligence helps individuals adapt and learn from different perspectives to create better solutions.

• Generational diversity shows how competing values play out. Millennials value money and status differently than older generations. Organizations need to understand these differences to effectively motivate and retain young talent. 

• Diversity should not be viewed as a challenge to overcome but an opportunity to pursue. Innovation depends on integrating diverse perspectives.

 

The author initially had a dismissive view of younger workers but came to appreciate their different perspectives and the value they bring. Hiring for diversity is important but is not enough. Organizations must utilize the diverse perspectives, not try to mold them into the existing values. Cultural differences exist around the world, though they manifest differently based on cultural contexts. 

There are several common but insufficient ways organizations address diversity:

1. Diversity fatigue: Many have done diversity work but are ready to move on. Some diversity efforts rely too much on shaming and punitive measures, which are not effective and paralyze real discussion.

2. Representation and compliance: Having a diverse staff is important but is not enough. Everyone must be committed to leveraging diversity. Members of minority groups should not be expected to always advocate for their group.

3. Cultural awareness training: This helps build self-awareness and understanding of cultural stereotypes but does not provide guidance on what to do with that awareness. Stereotypes are limited and cannot capture the diversity within cultural groups. 

4. Kumbuya: Some diversity efforts are perceived as soft, feel-good programs that lack clear ties to organizational strategy. Respect and understanding matter but are not enough. 

In summary, the author argues that diversity and inclusion must move beyond these limited approaches to truly cultivate cultural intelligence and innovation. Awareness and representation are a start but action is needed. Diversity must be strategically leveraged, not just discussed or complied with. And it requires commitment from all, not just minority groups. The future of work requires cultivating and utilizing diverse, intercultural perspectives.

 

- Dialogue and discussion have a place in promoting cultural intelligence and diversity. However, discussion alone is not enough. Action and innovation are also needed. 

- Diversity and cultural intelligence together lead to innovation. Diversity alone does not necessarily lead to better innovation. Individuals' cultural intelligence determines whether diversity promotes or inhibits innovation.

- There are two main reasons organizations need cultural intelligence: diverse markets (opportunities for growth) and a diverse workforce. The convergence of these two kinds of diversity presents both challenges and opportunities.

- Cultural intelligence or CQ is the ability to effectively navigate culturally diverse situations. There are four capabilities of CQ:

1. CQ Drive: Having the motivation and confidence to adapt cross-culturally
2. CQ Knowledge: Understanding cultural norms and differences 
3. CQ Strategy: Making sense of culturally diverse experiences and planning accordingly
4. CQ Action: Adapting verbal and nonverbal behavior appropriately in cross-cultural interactions

- Higher CQ leads to many benefits for individuals and organizations, including better performance, more opportunities, higher wages, accomplishing organizational missions, expansion into new markets, productivity, innovation, and profitability.

- A study found that individuals with higher CQ were more likely to speak up in culturally diverse groups, leading to more creative solutions. This shows that CQ can help overcome challenges of working in diverse groups.

- Diversity and inclusiveness are linked to innovation. Research shows that diverse and inclusive teams are most innovative.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- Diverse teams can lead to more innovation and better business outcomes, but only when team members have high cultural intelligence. 

- Homogenous teams outperform diverse teams when cultural intelligence is low. But when CQ is high, diverse teams are more innovative and productive.

- The greater the diversity on a team, the more potential for uncovering problems and creative solutions. But it requires cultural intelligence and is often a slower process.

- Companies like Novartis, Alibaba, and Google are committing to building cultural intelligence and diverse, inclusive workforces because diversity drives innovation and business success.

- Four elements are key to building a climate for culturally intelligent innovation:

  1) Commit to diversity and inclusion 
  2) Build self-awareness and adaptability
  3) Foster understanding of cultural differences
  4) Enable rich communication

- The process for driving culturally intelligent innovation includes:

  1) Assess your diversity and map your cultural intelligence 
  2) Set a vision and strategic priorities for diversity and inclusion
  3) Recruit, develop, and promote for cultural intelligence
  4) Create inclusive practices, policies, and spaces
  5) Foster intercultural collaboration and learning
  6) Measure and evaluate your progress

- Managing diversity and driving innovation is a long-term process that requires persistence and continuous learning. But the benefits to individual, team, and organizational effectiveness can be substantial.
