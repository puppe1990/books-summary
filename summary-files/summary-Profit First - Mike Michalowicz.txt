 Here's a summary of the praise for Profit First by Mike Michalowicz:

- Greg Crabtree, author: Says Profit First makes profitability simple. It gives you no excuse to not be profitable and have cash flow.

- Bob Burg, author: Says Mike is an innovative author. The Profit First system is simple, impactful, and can make the difference between struggling financially or being predictably profitable. 

- Dorie Clark, author: Says Profit First shows why few businesses are profitable and how to take home more money almost immediately.

- John Jantsh, author: Wishes he knew about Profit First when he started his first business. 

- Sofía Macias, author: Says finance is an entrepreneur's biggest headache and Profit First avoids bankruptcy for good business ideas. It's clever, easy to implement, and effective.

- Joe Woodard, CEO: Says entrepreneurs and advisors finally have a practical toolkit to increase profitability. Everyone in small business should read and apply the principles.

- Barry Moltz, author: Took the pledge and started implementing Profit First. His business turned a profit halfway through the book.

- Darnyelle Jervey, business owner: Says Profit First is helping her build a business that serves her. She added over $230,000 in profit in a year. Revenue grew 258%.

- Carrie Cunnington, business owner: Says her finances are organized, clean, profitable, disciplined, controlled, and motivated thanks to Profit First. She became debt-free. 

- Christian Maxin, business owner: Says he now only spends 60 minutes a week on financial planning thanks to Profit First. He feels relaxed, has a cushion, pays monthly taxes without hassle, grew profit 50% ($250,000), and revenue 20%.

- Paul Finney, business owner: Says once you have cash, opportunities appear. Sales grew from $3,000 to $15,000 per week. Costs dropped 20%. Aiming for $1 million revenue. 

- Helen and Rob Faulkner, business owners: After 18 years, finally feel successful thanks to Profit First. Paid off accounts, have a system to allocate funds, and took their first profit distribution. Saw Profit First as the "missing ingredient." Turned around the business and posted first profit in four weeks.

 Here is a summary of the chapters:

Chapter 2: The core principles of Profit First are to allocate a portion of revenue to profit immediately, pay yourself, and operate expense accounts like traditional bank accounts. This ensures profitability and avoids the feast and famine cycle.

Chapter 3: To set up Profit First, open separate bank accounts for Profit, Owner's Pay, and Operating Expenses. Immediately allocate funds to those accounts in the proper percentages when revenue comes in. This makes profit a priority. 

Chapter 4: The Instant Assessment shows a business's health by assessing accounts receivable, accounts payable, line of credit, and payroll coverage. Most businesses are underperforming and overextended. Profit First fixes this through the separate accounts and allocation method.

Chapter 5: The recommended percentages for allocation are: Profit - 15-20%, Owner's Pay - 25-50%, Operating Expenses - 50-80%. Start conservatively and adjust over time based on business needs and health. The key is allocating to profit immediately.

Chapter 6: To put Profit First in motion, deposit all revenue into an income account. Then immediately allocate and distribute funds to the Profit, Owner's Pay, and Operating Expense accounts. Pay all expenses directly from the Operating Expense account. This avoids temptation and ensures profit comes first.

Chapter 7: Apply excess from Operating Expenses to pay off debt, which provides freedom and reduces risk. Then reallocate to profit to build wealth. This method destroys debt and builds wealth over time through small, consistent reallocation from Operating Expenses.

The remaining chapters cover advanced techniques, applying Profit First to personal finances, how to sustain the method, stories from entrepreneurs who succeeded with Profit First, and appendixes with specific instructions and an assessment tool.

Overall, the key message is that making profit a true priority through a simple allocation method can transform businesses and lives. Profit First provides a systematic approach for entrepreneurs to build profitable, sustainable, and meaningful businesses.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

• The author struggled for years to keep his business afloat and survived paycheck to paycheck. He thought he was the problem until he realized the traditional accounting formula of Sales - Expenses = Profit was flawed. 

• The old profit formula creates “cash-eating monsters” of businesses that never have any money left over. The solution is to take your profit first before paying expenses. This is counterintuitive but profoundly simple.

• The author’s method - called Profit First - has already helped over 1,280 businesses become profitable. While an estimate, he believes over 30,000 companies now use Profit First.

• Keith Fear, a hot air balloon operator, tried Profit First after struggling for years. His profits increased by over 1,700% and his business was saved.

• Profit First also saved the author’s business and ensured his new ventures were profitable from day one. His newest company, Profit First Professionals, is 1,000% more profitable than any of his prior companies.

• The author’s life purpose is to help entrepreneurs become more profitable. He travels extensively promoting Profit First through speaking, podcasting, and updating his book. He aims to “eradicate entrepreneurial poverty.”

• The author told a woman named Debbie at CreativeLive that her last 10 difficult years in business were not wasted. The struggles she went through got her to where she is today, ready to learn Profit First.

• The key lesson is that the traditional accounting formula is flawed and counterintuitive solutions like Profit First are needed to build truly profitable businesses. Difficult experiences also prepare entrepreneurs to be receptive to radical new ideas.

 Here's a summary:

- The author started two successful companies and sold them, making millions of dollars. 
- He received a check for $388,000 and went on a spending spree, buying expensive cars and renting a house in Hawaii. He thought he had been successful and could live lavishly.
- However, the author then invested in and funded over a dozen startups, believing his "golden touch" would make them successful. He spent recklessly, cutting checks for $5,000 to $50,000 at a time. 
- The author focused solely on growth and pumping money into the startups. He eventually realized this strategy was unsustainable and he was losing millions of dollars. 
- The author's wake-up call came when his daughter's piggy bank made him realize he was putting no money aside for the future. He recognized he knew how to make money but not how to take profit. 
- The author says most business owners face a similar struggle, living a "financial nightmare" and constantly trying to pay bills and expenses. Their businesses have become "cash-eating monsters."
- The author created the Profit First system to help entrepreneurs gain control of their businesses' finances, take profit, and achieve stability.

The key takeaways are:

1) Making money (income) and taking profit are two very different things. Many business owners are good at the former but not the latter.

2) Uncontrolled growth and reckless spending will lead to financial ruin. Profit and financial stability must be prioritized.

3) Most entrepreneurs struggle with "cash-eating monsters" for businesses and live in a constant state of financial stress. A system is needed to fix this.

4) The author's wake-up call and the development of the Profit First system were motivated by a desire to help other entrepreneurs gain control and profitability.

 Here is a summary:
The author had built up several businesses through massive investments but lost nearly everything when most of the companies failed within a year. On Valentine’s Day 2008, he was left with only $10,000 in his bank account and over $30,000 in bills. His 9-year-old daughter offered her piggy bank savings to help the family through the difficulties. 

The author realized he lacked knowledge in financial management and profitability despite being skilled in growing businesses. He operated his companies on a “check-to-check” basis, spending as much as he earned without concern for sustainability. Money problems arise when sales slow down or speed up beyond control. It is difficult to cut costs after expanding operations. Many large companies struggle with profitability and accumulate debt.

Success should not be defined solely by revenue or business size. Large revenues and a big company do not necessarily mean the owner is successful or profitable. Some big businesses struggle to stay afloat by funneling available funds into the company. Real success comes from building a sustainable, profitable company. Bigger is not always better.

The key lessons are: manage money and profitability, not just growth; do not spend beyond your means; and define success by profitability, not just revenue or size. Build a sustainable business model and avoid debt. Check-to-check operations lead to money problems. Cut costs before expanding.

 Here is a summary:

- Most entrepreneurs focus primarily on growth in the hopes that profits will follow. However, growth alone does not guarantee profits or a healthy business. Businesses need to focus on profitability, not just growth. 

- The author uses the analogy of a bodybuilder with massive arms and chest but toothpick legs. While the bodybuilder can throw powerful punches, his legs will give out and he will collapse without balance. Similarly, businesses that focus only on growth will eventually collapse without strong profitability and cash flow.

- Entrepreneurs often assume that more revenue will eventually lead to more profit. However, profit always seems just out of reach, like a donkey chasing a carrot. Businesses get stuck in a cycle of growing endlessly without actually becoming profitable.

- The author argues that profit should not be an eventual outcome or goal. Rather, profitability needs to be built into the business model and focused on every day. Revenue and growth are secondary. Profit is a habit, not an event.

- Many entrepreneurs operate their businesses by constantly checking their bank balances. When there is money in the account, they spend it. When the balance is low, they panic and desperately try to generate more revenue. This cycle of living "check to check and panic to panic" prevents businesses from becoming truly profitable and stable. 

- To break this cycle, businesses need an effective money management system that works with human nature rather than against it. The "survival trap" of constantly chasing more revenue to survive leads businesses to become unprofitable monsters. 

- In summary, the key message is that profitability, not growth, should be the primary focus of businesses. Growth and revenue alone do not lead to healthy, sustainable companies. Businesses need to build the habit of profitability to achieve stability and success.

 Here is a summary:

- The author uses the example of Ernie, a lawn mowing business owner, to illustrate the perils of the “Survival Trap.” Ernie offered additional services like gutter cleaning, roofing, and chimney repair to captive clients in order to earn “easy money” and get out of financial crisis. However, these decisions took Ernie’s business further away from his original vision and core competency of lawn mowing. 
- The Survival Trap provides temporary financial relief but the costs quickly add up and the business becomes inefficient and unprofitable. Businesses get stuck in a cycle of surviving crisis to crisis. 
- Traditional accounting methods like GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) exacerbate the Survival Trap. They focus business owners on increasing sales and reducing costs, rather than profits. This leads to uncontrolled business growth and expenses. 
- GAAP goes against human nature. No matter how much money a business makes, owners will find ways to spend it all, and consider all expenses “necessary.” Soon, the money runs out and the business is back in crisis. 
- GAAP also causes the “Primacy Effect.” It focuses business owners first on sales and expenses, so they concentrate on those while becoming “blind” to profits. 
- The mantra “what gets measured, gets done” means that GAAP leads businesses to prioritize sales growth over everything else. Expenses are treated as a “necessary evil” to support sales, rather than being carefully controlled and leveraged.

In summary, the Survival Trap and reliance on GAAP accounting often lead growing businesses into a cycle of crisis and haphazard growth by focusing them on the wrong priorities like uncontrolled sales and expense growth rather than efficiency, profits, and a clear vision.

 Here is a summary:

- GAAP accounting is complex and flawed. It defines profit differently than entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs see profit as cash in the bank, while GAAP focuses on income statements, balance sheets, and other reports. 

- Entrepreneurs are humans and think differently than accountants. Entrepreneurs tend to rely on their intuition and gut instincts. They frequently check their bank balances and make decisions based on what they see. In contrast, accountants logically analyze financial reports and ratios.

- Profit First is designed for humans and works with human behaviors and habits. It is simple to understand and focuses on cash flow. It tells entrepreneurs exactly how much they can spend and how much they need to save. In contrast, GAAP requires entrepreneurs to change their habits and learn to analyze complex financial reports.

- Many businesses end up controlling entrepreneurs’ lives like Frankenstein’s monster. Profit First helps entrepreneurs regain control of their businesses and turn them into profit-generating “cash cows.” By following the Profit First system, businesses can become highly profitable.

- In summary, Profit First works with human behaviors while GAAP requires people to change. Profit First is simple to understand and focuses on generating cash, while GAAP is complex and focuses on accounting reports. By using Profit First, entrepreneurs can take control of their businesses and make them highly profitable.

 Here's a summary:

The author went through a period of depression and financial troubles after losing his business. One night, while watching TV, he learned that using smaller plates can help people lose weight because they serve themselves smaller portions and end up eating less without noticing. 

This gave the author an idea. He realized that his company was putting all its money into one big "plate"—the operating account—and then spending it all. He decided he needed to use smaller plates for his business's finances by distributing the money into different accounts.

The four core principles the author came up with were:

1. Use small plates - Put money into separate accounts instead of one big operating account. This would force the business to spend less.

2. Healthy ratios - Determine the right ratios for allocating money to different accounts like profit, taxes, and expenses.

3. Measure success - Regularly measure key metrics to ensure the ratios and allocations are working. 

4. Automate the process - Set up automatic transfers so the right amounts go into each account each month without having to think about it.

The author realized that taking profit first and determining the right financial ratios and allocations could help make his company permanently profitable, just like smaller plates and the right diet can help people lose weight in a sustainable way. He was determined to turn his business around using these Profit First principles.

 Here is a summary:

1. Parkinson’s Law: Why Your Business Is Like a Tube of Toothpaste 
- Parkinson’s Law: The demand for something expands to match its supply. 
- When we have more of something, we consume more of it. This applies to food, time, money, etc.
- When we have less, we become frugal and innovative. By taking profit first, businesses are forced to be frugal and innovative.

2. The Primacy Effect: Why the First Part of Profit First Matters
- The Primacy Effect: We place more significance on what we encounter first. 
- When profit comes first, it becomes the focus and is never forgotten. When sales and expenses come first, profit is an afterthought.

3. Remove Temptation: Once You Take Your Profit First, Put It Away
- Removing temptation by putting money out of sight helps avoid overspending. 
- When profit is taken first and removed from access, businesses work with what they have left and don't worry about what they can't access. The profit account acts as a bonus.

4. Enforce a Rhythm 
- Enforcing a rhythm helps avoid reactive spending and panicking. It provides an easy way to monitor cash flow.
- Checking bank account balances regularly enforces a rhythm and provides a quick overview of cash flow in the business. Big balances allow for action, while small balances prompt frugality.

In summary, the principles of Parkinson's Law, the Primacy Effect, removing temptation, and enforcing a rhythm can help businesses thrive by focusing on profit, spending judiciously, and maintaining healthy cash flow.

 Here is a summary:

- Taking your profit first will lead to faster, healthier growth. It will help you focus on what is profitable and fix or eliminate what is not. By getting better at what your customers want, you will attract more of them and grow. 

- The new accounting formula is: Sales - Profit = Expenses. You allocate money to different accounts (profit, owner's compensation, taxes, operating expenses) in predetermined percentages. Then you pay bills only from what's left in operating expenses. If there's not enough, you need to cut expenses.

- Use small plates: Disperse money from your income account into different accounts.  Serve sequentially: Allocate to profit, owner's comp, taxes, then operating expenses, in that order. Pay bills only from operating expenses. 

- Remove temptation: Make it hard to access your profit and other accounts. Use an accountability system. Enforce a rhythm: Allocate money and pay bills twice a month. 

- Lower the bar: Take one small, easy action to start gaining momentum, like setting up a separate profit account and transferring 1% of all deposits into it. This helps you get used to reserving profit up front. Your profit will accumulate and give you confidence in the system.

- The goals are to prove the system to yourself, gain confidence by reserving some profit, and get into the habit and rhythm, even though the amounts are small. The key is to stick with this first step.

 Here is a summary:

The goal of Profit First is to help you realize that taking profit first is not scary. Once you get used to it, you will be set up for more success.

To get started with Profit First:

1. Trust the process. It may feel unfamiliar but it works. Commit to trying it and see the results. 

2. Open one new bank account called “Profit”. Keep it simple and open a checking account. 

3. Transfer 1% of your current money into the Profit account. Leave it there and don’t touch it.

To set up Profit First in your business:

Most entrepreneurs use “bank balance accounting” where you log into your bank account, see your balances, and make decisions based on that. Profit First works with bank balance accounting but adds more bank accounts for specific purposes.

Set up these 5 bank accounts:

1. Income 
2. Profit
3. Owner’s Comp
4. Tax 
5. Opex (for operating expenses)

Name the accounts according to their purpose. Use your existing bank account as the Opex account. Start depositing income into the Income account. 

Also set up two “no-temptation” accounts - one for Profit and one for Tax. Transfer money from your primary accounts into these accounts and leave the money there. This helps ensure you don’t spend it on other things.

The key is to set up the structure, then continue making decisions based on your bank balances like you’re used to. But now the money will be allocated for specific purposes. Profit First puts “guardrails” around your usual behavior.

 Here is a summary:

1. Set up separate secondary bank accounts for profit and tax to avoid temptation of using that money. If the money is not easily accessible, you are less likely to spend it. 
2. The profit account is for your profit and the tax account is for tax payments. You should not borrow money from these accounts. Doing so is essentially stealing from yourself (in the case of profit) or the government (in the case of taxes).
3. Choose a bank you have never used before for the secondary accounts. You want these accounts to be inconvenient to access. Look for a bank with low or no minimum balance or transfer fees. 
4. At the secondary bank, set up two savings accounts named PROFIT HOLD and TAX HOLD. Link these accounts to your primary bank's PROFIT and TAX accounts so you can transfer money between them. 
5. Transfer money from your primary bank's PROFIT and TAX accounts to the secondary PROFIT HOLD and TAX HOLD accounts regularly. This keeps the money out of sight but still earns interest. You will know your cash positions in your primary accounts but the money in the secondary accounts will be less accessible. 
6. People often ask how they can take a profit when they have never been profitable. The answer is you must change your behavior. Remove the profit first and operate on less, just as you have done in lean times. If nothing changes, nothing changes. 
7. People also ask why they need secondary accounts at a different bank instead of just tracking this on spreadsheets. The reason is spreadsheets do not change behavior. Your bank balance determines how you act. Secondary accounts insert the profit first system into your normal habits. 
8. Choose banks that suit your needs. Your primary bank should offer easy account access and money transfers. Your secondary bank should offer inconvenience - require in-person visits and certified checks to withdraw money. Tell banks your needs and switch if they do not accommodate you. 
9. Get your business ready by setting up the five foundational accounts: INCOME, PROFIT, OWNER'S COMP, TAX and OPEX. Keep your existing checking account as OPEX and open new accounts for the others. Ask your bank to waive any fees or minimums. If they refuse, find a new bank.

The summary outlines the key steps and rationale provided in the details on setting up a profit first system using secondary bank accounts. The goal is to separate profit and tax money by making it less accessible, earn interest on it, and change behaviors to put profit first. Choosing the right banks, negotiating the right terms, and taking the proper actions to get accounts set up are emphasized.

 Here is a summary of the instructions:

Set up two external savings accounts with a bank other than your primary bank:

1. PROFIT HOLD account - This is for holding your profits. Do not enable any convenience options like online access, checkbooks, or debit cards for this account.

2. TAX HOLD account - This is for holding money for your tax payments. Do not enable any convenience options like online access, checkbooks, or debit cards for this account.

Complete the Instant Assessment:

1. Get your P&L, tax returns, and balance sheet for the last 12 months. If you don’t have these, you can still do the assessment without them. 

2. In cell A1, enter your total revenue from the last 12 months. This is your “top line revenue.”

3. In cell A2, enter your costs for materials and subcontractors if they make up 25% or more of your top line revenue. Do not include your own labor costs here. If materials and subcontractors are less than 25% of revenue or you are unsure, enter $0.

4. Service companies where employees provide most of the work should enter $0 in cell A2.

5. The goal is to adjust your revenue to represent what you really make after accounting for significant materials and subcontractor costs. If unsure, enter $0.

6. Do not overthink this or make nominal adjustments. The assessment aims to determine your realistic revenue and expenses.

 Here is a summary:

The goal is to calculate your company's "real revenue" by subtracting materials and subcontractor costs from total revenue. Real revenue represents the money your company actually makes and has control over. It provides a more accurate picture of your profitability than gross revenue.

To calculate real revenue:

1. Determine your total revenue over the past 12 months. 

2. Subtract any costs for materials and subcontractors. The remaining amount is your real revenue.

3. Calculate your actual profit, owner's compensation, taxes paid, and operating expenses over the past year. Add these up to make sure they match your real revenue number. Adjust as needed.

4. Apply the recommended target allocation percentages from  to your real revenue to determine target amounts for each of the metrics (profit, owner's comp, taxes, operating expenses).

5. Subtract the target amounts from your actual amounts to determine the "delta" - how much you need to increase or decrease each number.

6. Mark whether you need to "increase" or "decrease" next to each metric to fix the delta.

The target allocation percentages provide guidance for maintaining a healthy balance across different areas like profit, compensation, and operating expenses. They may not match your exact situation but provide a good starting point. You can then make gradual changes over time to work toward the target percentages in a sustainable way.

The key is gaining an understanding of your "real" financial position and the changes needed to build a profitable, sustainable company. Making incremental improvements over time is the key to success.

 Here is a summary:

Focus on increasing profits because growing from $1M to $5M is the hardest for most businesses. Have some cash reserve. 

From $1M to $5M, systems become mandatory. Knowledge must be converted to systems and processes. Spend more on operating expenses. Spend less time working in the business and more working on the business and selling.

From $5M to $10M, bring in management and a clear second tier of management forms. The founder focuses on their strengths. The owner gets most income from profit, not salary.

From $10M to $50M, achieve predictable growth. The founder’s income is mostly profit. Leverage efficiency to maximize profitability.

For a new business with no revenue yet, start Profit First now to build the habit. Use 1% for PROFIT, 50% for OWNER’S COMP, and 15% for TAX. Adjust quarterly. Focus on getting started, don’t worry about advanced strategies yet.

Take action now: do the Instant Assessment. It will be hard but helps you face reality and see where you need to make changes.

If overwhelmed, that’s normal. Take a break and come back when ready. But start a PROFIT account and move 1% of each deposit into it to start building the habit, even if it seems like a small amount. You can keep running your business as usual but will start developing the profit habit.

 Here is a summary of Chapter 5:

- Set allocation percentages for your PROFIT, OWNER’S COMP, and TAX accounts. This chapter provides guidance for determining customized percentages for your business.

- Two common problems entrepreneurs face are:
1. Getting bogged down in the details and never actually implementing the system. Move on and start using Profit First, then come back to tweak the percentages.
2. Taking action too quickly without proper preparation. Go slowly by starting with small percentage allocations and building up over time. Don’t start with 20% profit right away.

- Target Allocation Percentages (TAPs) are the percentages you aspire to reach. They are based on surveys of fiscally successful companies. Your Current Allocation Percentages (CAPs) are where you are now. Slowly and consistently adjust your CAPs to get closer to the TAPs.

- Determine your Profit TAP by:
1. Researching public companies in your industry and calculating their average profit percentage over 3-5 years. Use this as your TAP. 
2. Reviewing your tax returns from the last 3-5 years and determining your most profitable year by percentage.
3. Picking a percentage based on your projected revenue for this year and the Instant Assessment.

- You may never fully reach your TAPs, but keep working to get as close as possible. The key is making small, consistent changes over time.

 Here is a summary:

- The author suggests that a high profit allocation percentage is ideal, but it is not sustainable in the long run due to competition. The only way to maintain high margins is through constant innovation. 

- There are two options for determining the Owner's Compensation Target (Owner's Comp TAP):

1. Base it on the actual work that the business owners do and the salary needed to replace them. Then add 25% as a buffer. For example, if 4 owners draw a $50K salary, the Owner's Comp TAP should be at least 25% of revenue.

2. Use the suggested percentages from the Instant Assessment based on the company's revenue range. The money allocated to Owner's Comp is divided among the working owners. It does not have to be split evenly based on equity. 

- Owner's Comp treats the working business owners as employees. It is important to adequately compensate them as they are the most important employees. The way Owner's Comp is disbursed depends on the business formation (S-corp, LLC, sole proprietorship, C-corp). It is best to work with an accountant knowledgeable in Profit First.

- Many entrepreneurs underpay themselves in the early days of their business. They need to transition slowly from working in the business to working on the business by building systems. When revenue is under $250K, the owner is likely the only employee. Between $250K to $500K revenue with a couple employees, the owner is still doing 90% of the work. Only 10% of time should be spent on systematizing. The large Owner's Comp percentage in the beginning accounts for this.

- The key message is that business owners must not underpay themselves. They need to determine fair compensation for the work they actually do in order to adequately support themselves and their families. Building a business is a gradual process.

 Here is a summary of the passage:

- Jorge Morales and José Pain were early adopters of the Profit First system after reading about it briefly in The Toilet Paper Entrepreneur. 
- They paid for a trip from Florida to New Jersey to attend a meetup with the author, Mike Michalowicz, using money from their Profit account. 
- They went all-in on the Profit First system based on the little information provided in the book and were seeing good results.
- When they started their business, Specialized ECU Repair, in 2007, their dream was to have extra money from the profits to spend on themselves while working less, as they thought all business owners did. 
- Many experienced entrepreneurs would chuckle at this naivete since most business owners struggle to make a profit and work long hours. 
- However, Jorge and José were able to achieve this goal by using the Profit First system. They paid themselves well, took vacations, and had a good work-life balance, all while growing their revenue and being profitable.
- The author attributes their success to going all-in on the Profit First principles from the start, paying themselves first, and continually improving the percentages over time based on their results.

The key takeaway is that by implementing the Profit First system fully and consistently over time, Jorge and José were able to achieve the dream that many business owners never realize - making good money, working reasonable hours, and having work-life balance. Their success proves the power of the Profit First method.

 Here is a summary:

- Entrepreneurship requires personal sacrifice and hard work. Many entrepreneurs wrongly believe that eventually they will make enough money to enjoy lots of leisure time and hobbies.

- Jorge and José realized this was unrealistic. Two years into their business, they started increasing their salaries and following the Profit First system. They allocated a percentage of revenue to a PROFIT account, which let them pay themselves, invest in their business, and enjoy life. 

- In 2013, their revenue exceeded projections. They now have 6 employees and pay above industry average. They increased their PROFIT percentage to 9%. The Profit First system gives them cash on hand to take advantage of deals and make quick purchasing decisions. Their accountant now supports them fully.

- The Profit First system works for any business. You start with a PROFIT percentage target, then build toward it. Your business will become efficient at generating profit, no matter how small the deposit.

- To implement Profit First:

1. Tell your accountant/bookkeeper. Some will support you, while others won’t understand. Ask doubters if they have experience with Profit First. If not, have them read the book. If they still don’t support you, find a new accountant. 

2. Set up your foundational accounts: INCOME, PROFIT, OWNER’S COMP, TAX, OPEX. Also set up PROFIT HOLD and TAX HOLD accounts at a separate bank. Add your current allocation percentage (CAP) and target allocation percentage (TAP) to the account names, e.g. “PROFIT 8% (TAP 15%)”.

3. Make your first PROFIT and TAX transfers. Take your CAP percentages from revenue and move the money to the PROFIT HOLD and TAX HOLD accounts. Repeat this for all future deposits.

4. Pay your PROFIT and TAX. Transfer money from the HOLD accounts to your PROFIT and TAX accounts to pay yourself and the government. Aim to do this regularly and on time.  

5. Adjust and rebalance. Slowly adjust your CAPs to reach your TAPs. Move excess money from OPEX to PROFIT/OWNER’S COMP. Rebalance all accounts so they match the TAPs. Review and revise your TAPs regularly based on your business’s needs.

6. Automate and habituate. Automate as many of the transfers and payments as possible. Build the Profit First habits and discipline into your daily routines. Review your accounts weekly to ensure you stay on track.

The key is to start, take action, and stay committed. Profit First will transform your business and life.

 Here is a summary:

- When you first log into your bank accounts, you will clearly see how much money is available and allocated for different purposes based on the targets you have set.

- The final setup of your bank accounts should look something like this:

INCOME 
PROFIT (1%) 
OWNER’S COMP (5%)
TAX (1%)
OPEX (93%)

- Start with small, manageable percentages (CAPs) in each account, not the target percentages (TAPs) you want to eventually reach. Increase the CAPs over time.

- For most businesses, Day Zero profit and taxes will be 0%. Use the total amount paid to owners as Owner’s Comp. Operating Expenses is everything else.

- Add 1% to Day Zero Profit, Owner’s Comp and Taxes. Subtract 3% from Operating Expenses. This establishes a slow start and helps build momentum.

- The goal is to start the automatic allocations, then adjust each quarter until reaching the target percentages. Take small, easy steps to gain momentum.

- In the example, Day Zero was:

Profit: 0%
Owner’s Comp: 4%  
Taxes: 0%
Operating Expenses: 96%

- By adding 1% to Profit, Owner’s Comp and Taxes, and subtracting 3% from Opex, the CAPs became:  

Profit: 1%  
Owner’s Comp: 5%  
Taxes: 1%
Operating Expenses: 93%

- The system will self-correct over time with adjustments each quarter. The key is simply getting started, even if the initial percentages aren’t perfect.

 Here is a summary:

- The business allocates money from its income based on the percentages set for each account:
INCOME: 8855
PROFIT: 1% 
OWNER’S COMP: 5%
TAX: 1%
OPEX: 93%

- For a $2,000 income example, the allocations would be:
PROFIT: $20 
OWNER’S COMP: $100
TAX: $20
OPEX: $1,860

- The business is advised to cut expenses by at least 10% immediately to fund the PROFIT, OWNER’S COMP and TAX accounts. This can be done by canceling unnecessary expenses and negotiating existing recurring expenses.

- The business is advised to get into a rhythm of doing accounting and paying bills twice a month, on the 10th and 25th. This involves:

1. Tallying all new deposits and allocating to the PROFIT, OWNER’S COMP, TAX and OPEX accounts based on the set percentages. 

2. Tallying up all the bills due and paying them from the OPEX account. Any bills not due yet are held until the next accounting date.

3. Reviewing reports to ensure enough money is in each account to pay the necessary expenses. If not, money can be moved from another account. The goal is to never be late on payments.

4. Once all accounting and payments are done for the period, no other accounting or bill paying is done until the next accounting date. This helps provide clarity and control over the business's cash flow.

The key benefits of this rhythm and process are gaining control and clarity over the business's finances, ensuring all responsibilities like PROFIT, TAX and OWNER'S COMP are addressed, and avoiding late or missed payments. It leads to a healthier business overall.

 Here's a summary:

The author started paying bills on time and being less reactive about them by implementing a system of reviewing bills and income on the 10th and 25th of each month. This allowed the author to see patterns in income and expenses, cancel unnecessary expenses, and pay bills on time. 

The system involves:

1. Depositing all income into an INCOME account. 
2. On the 10th and 25th, transferring money from the INCOME account to other accounts like PROFIT, OWNER'S COMP, TAXES, and OPERATING EXPENSES based on predetermined percentages. 
3. Transferring the full amounts from the PROFIT and TAX accounts to separate bank accounts. 
4. Paying yourself from the OWNER'S COMP account. 
5. Paying bills from the OPERATING EXPENSES account.

Sometimes there may not be enough to pay bills or yourself adequately. This signifies your business cannot support your current spending levels. But stick to the system to understand your cash flow.

Every quarter, on the first day, take 50% of the PROFIT account as a distribution to equity owners. The other 50% remains in the account as a reserve. The distribution amount is divided among owners based on percentage owned. The profit distribution cannot be put back into the company. It must be distributed as a reward to owners. The company should operate off revenue that covers operating expenses.

 Here is a summary:

- Do not try to quickly get out of debt by making drastic cuts, it will not work in the long run. You need sustainable changes.

- Many business owners focus on increasing revenue as a measure of success but do not actually retain much of that money. They end up accumulating debt. 

- Pete called Mike knowing Mike was writing the first version of Profit First. Pete had a successful business but it was loaded with debt, even though revenue was high.

- The solution to paying off debt is not cutting expenses to the bone.  That is like crash dieting - you may lose weight quickly but will gain it back. You need a sustainable lifestyle change.

- To get out of debt in a sustainable way, allocate a percentage of your revenue to pay off debt. This forces you to make operational changes to maintain profitability at the reduced revenue level. Those changes become habit and stick even as revenue increases again.

- Paying off debt should be a habit and part of your regular cash flow distribution, not a one-time push to pay it off as quickly as possible while making huge sacrifices.  Make consistent progress over time through small changes.

- Once debt is paid off, continue putting that percentage of revenue toward other financial priorities like investing in growth or paying off a mortgage. The habit of allocating funds should continue.

 Here's a summary:

- The main character, Mike, received an unexpected call from his friend Pete, who lives in New York City.
- Pete called to cancel dinner plans for the weekend and told Mike he was broke. Pete's bank had called in his $1 million line of credit, meaning he had 30 days to pay the full amount back. 
- Pete asked Mike for help and was desperate, saying he'd do anything Mike suggested. Mike agreed to help Pete find a way to resolve his debt.
- Mike explained that focusing solely on debt repayment is short-sighted and wouldn't fix the underlying issues in Pete's business. Mike said Pete needed to implement the Profit First system to build a healthy, sustainable business. 
- Following Profit First, Pete should distribute 99% of his profits to debt repayment and 1% to rewarding himself. This would allow aggressive debt paydown while strengthening the profit habit. 
- Suze Orman said the key to overcoming debt is enjoying saving money more than spending it. Wealth and business success are emotional. Profit First works by changing your mindset and the story you tell yourself.
- Pain motivates initial action, but pleasure sustains change. Paying down debt reduces pain, but only enjoying the habit of saving and profiting will make change last.
- Give yourself joy and rewards for saving money and growing profit, not just increased revenue. Celebrate your wins to train yourself to prefer saving over spending.  
- Entrepreneurs tend to be optimistic but base their business operations on their best month, not preparing properly for downturns. They need to plan based on their worst months to build resiliency.

 Here is a summary:

1. Look at your 12-month rolling average revenue and expenses, not just your best or worst months. This gives you a truer picture of your financial situation. 

2. Basing decisions on your best revenue month will quickly lead to cash flow problems and debt. Entrepreneurs often mistakenly think their best month is the new normal.

3. Use percentages to allocate your variable revenue to different accounts like owner’s compensation. This helps ensure you have enough set aside for your salary even in slow months. Review and raise your salary quarterly based on what’s accumulating in the account.

4. Do a “debt freeze” to stop accumulating new debt and pay off existing debt:

- Print 12 months of financial statements and go through each expense line by line. Mark them as P (generates profit), R (can replace with cheaper alternative), or U (unnecessary). Circle any recurring expenses.

- Add up all expenses for the year and divide by 12 to get your monthly “nut” or necessary expenses. Compare to your target from the instant assessment and cut expenses until 10% below that target. Cut U expenses first, then R, then restructure P expenses. 

- Evaluate labor costs, the biggest expense for most businesses. Determine which roles are mandatory for operations. Look at cutting unnecessary or replaceable roles. The owner is often underutilized, so you may need to start doing more of the work again.

- Cut expenses in a way that won’t irreparably hurt your business. The goal is cutting fat, not muscle. You want to minimize “bounce-back” where you have to add some expenses back in.

- Pay off high-interest debts first while making minimum payments on everything else. Then focus on moderate interest debts. Pay off or restructure any toxic debts. 

- Once you’ve cut to your target “nut” and are paying off debts, the “freeze” starts. Don’t accumulate any new debt. Use profits to continue paying off old debt. Only spend from what’s left in your operating account.

5. The debt freeze is not about eliminating all spending but rather cutting unnecessary costs and using profits to pay off debt so you can eventually spend and invest in growth from a place of financial security and stability. Staying optimistic and looking at the bigger picture helps make good long term decisions.

 Here is a summary:

1. Evaluate your staff and lay off underperforming employees or those in unnecessary roles. This is difficult but necessary to stabilize your company. Do it respectfully by explaining the reasons, providing references and severance if possible. Reassure remaining staff. 

2. Stop automatic withdrawals and payments. Get new credit cards to avoid recurring charges transferring over. Pay vendors by check going forward so you are aware of each expense. Small, recurring fees can add up significantly over time without realizing it.

3. Delay any purchases that can wait. Challenge yourself to go "just one more day" without buying something to see if you really need it. This saves money and opens you up to new options.

4. Cut any unnecessary (U) expenses immediately. Negotiate necessary (R) expenses to reduce costs, using alternatives as leverage. Start with small expenses to build confidence, then move to larger ones. The goal is to cut operating costs by at least 10%. 

5. Feel relief from reducing debt and expenses. Overcoming embarrassment about cutting back will be replaced by the confidence of stabilizing your financial situation. Many have been in dire straits before and recovered by taking control of their costs. The key is in your hands.

In summary, make difficult but necessary cuts, stop automatic and recurring charges to regain control and awareness of spending, delay purchasing when possible, negotiate lower costs on must-haves, and feel good about taking these important steps toward financial security. Stay disciplined and focused, and you can overcome significant debt and expenses.

 Here is a summary:

The traditional definition of business success focuses on maximizing revenue, number of employees, and office space. A new definition focuses on maximizing profit through minimal resources. The goal is efficiency, frugality, and innovation rather than size, appearance, and popularity. The mission is to change the perspective of success from "make a lot" to "save a lot" and eliminate entrepreneurial debt.  

If a business owes the bank $1 million, it is the bank's problem. A business in debt should implement a "profit first" method by cutting expenses, generating profit, and negotiating with creditors. Small, consistent action leads to progress in reducing debt. For example, Pete owed $1 million but cut expenses, turned a profit in 3 months, and reduced his debt by 5% so far. Like Pete, a baseball team owner named Jesse owed $1.3 million but used the profit first method to pay off most of this debt in 2 years. To build momentum in paying off debt, focus on small victories by paying off the smallest debts first before moving to larger ones. Stop incurring new debt while paying off existing debts.  

To find money within a business:

1. Implement a spending freeze to cut expenses by at least 10% below the level suggested by an instant assessment. 

2. Allocate 99% of profit to debt payoff while reserving 1% for small rewards and celebration. 

3. Use the "debt snowball" method by paying off the smallest debts first and then using the money from those paid-off debts to pay larger ones. Build momentum through small wins.

The key is to look for expenses to cut in places most would not consider. There are always more opportunities to save money in a business than meet the eye. With a "profit first" mindset, a business can find ways to significantly cut costs and become lean and efficient.

 Here is a summary:

The author argues that business owners should focus on efficiency and innovation, not just increasing sales, in order to increase profitability. The author tells the story of an entrepreneur, Mr. Innovator, who grew his company by finding ways to do things much more efficiently. Mr. Innovator cut his company's costs in half by consolidating their delivery trucks. 

The author says that relying on increasing sales alone, or "making it rain," will not lead to higher profits if a company's costs remain unchecked. It is smarter to find efficiencies, like "digging a well." The author uses Idaho as an example, saying that most of Idaho's water comes from underground aquifers, not rain. Similarly, 95% of a company's profitability comes from efficiencies, not sales.

The author discusses "the profit squeeze," which is when companies increase profits through innovation but then competition causes them to drop prices, squeezing profits. He uses the example of flat screen TVs becoming much more affordable over time. The author says companies must continually find new efficiencies to counter the profit squeeze. Doubling results while halving effort through new efficiencies can boost profit margins and overall profits.

The key takeaway is that business owners should focus on efficiency and cost-cutting, not just increasing sales. Improving efficiency leads to higher profit margins and more overall profits. Only once efficiencies have been maximized should the focus shift to increasing sales. An iterative process of improving efficiency, increasing sales, and then improving efficiency again will maximize profits.

 Here is a summary:

•Focus on efficiency. Try to get twice the results with half the effort. Look at all areas of your business and figure out how to improve efficiency. This could lead to major cost savings and innovation.

•Start by setting a big goal, like doubling results with half the effort. This will force you to think big and make both small and large improvements. 

•Small improvements, like doing a task 5 minutes faster, won’t have a major impact. You need to focus on substantially improving efficiency. For example, a snowplow that can move snow twice as fast. These bigger improvements, scaled across your business, can lead to huge gains.

•Look for ways to cut costs, even if you can’t implement them immediately. Chip away at expenses over time. For example, releasing some employees and streamlining processes. This allowed one business owner to double profits and increase his salary by 46% in a year.

•You may need to “fire” bad, unprofitable clients. Studies show that the top 25% of clients often generate 89% of revenue, while the bottom 25% only generate 1% of revenue but require almost as much effort. Shedding bad clients frees you up to better serve good clients and boosts efficiency and profits.

•Don’t be afraid to make big changes. Many people dismiss major efficiency improvements as “impossible” without seriously considering them. But with an open and innovative mindset, you can achieve major gains that initially seemed out of reach.

•Profit First helped one business achieve “impossible” goals like setting aside money for taxes and a home down payment for the first time in over 10 years of business. By focusing on efficiency and cutting costs, they found money that had been elusive before.

So in summary, massively improving efficiency through setting aggressive goals, cutting costs, firing bad clients, making big changes, and adopting an innovative mindset can lead to huge bottom-line benefits in your business. Don’t dismiss ideas as “impossible” without really exploring them. You may be missing opportunities for breakthrough efficiency gains.

 Here is a summary:

The business focused on serving all clients equally, regardless of their revenue or profit contribution. This resulted in the same effort being spent on high-revenue, high-profit clients as well as low-revenue, low-profit clients. 

An analysis showed that the top 25% of clients generated 150% of profits. The middle 50% were break-even. And the bottom 25% resulted in a 50% loss. The profits from the top clients subsidized the losses from the bottom clients.

The author recommends firing the unprofitable clients. Although counterintuitive, this can increase profitability and reduce stress. It frees up time and resources to focus on the most profitable clients.

The author recommends “cloning” the best clients by finding more clients like them. This leads to greater efficiency, better service, and automatic marketing. Having many similar, profitable clients is very valuable.

The “Pareto overlap” means finding the overlap between the most profitable clients and most profitable products/services. This can reveal opportunities to fire unprofitable clients, better serve existing clients, or find new clients. The key is focusing on what is most profitable.

An example is given of a lawn service expanding into other areas like gutter cleaning, roof repair, etc. Although sales increased, costs increased more due to new equipment and labor. The business ended up losing money and being inefficient as it tried to do too many things. The example shows why focus and efficiency are important. Expanding into too many areas can lead to the “survival trap.”

In summary, the key recommendations are: fire unprofitable clients; focus on the most profitable clients; avoid expanding into too many areas; and maximize efficiency through focus. Profitability depends more on percentages than absolute numbers. The strategies help shift a business into a profitable, efficient, and focused state.

 Here is a summary:

Shawn has achieved efficiency in his business. He recognizes efficiency as the key to increasing profits. Simply selling more is difficult and often leads to lower profit margins. Shawn suggests first implementing efficiency strategies like firing poor clients, better serving good clients and streamlining your offerings. Then focus on smart selling. 

Shawn suggests two action steps:

1. Identify one part of your business that serves your best customers. Figure out how to double the results while halving the effort.

2. Identify your weakest clients and end those relationships. Do so politely and professionally.

For advanced Profit First techniques, Shawn suggests adding additional accounts to customize the system for your unique business needs. However, only do this after running the core Profit First system for at least 6 months. The additional accounts Shawn recommends considering include:

- The Vault: An emergency fund with 3 months of cash reserves. Have rules in place for using this money in case of emergencies. 

- Stocking Account: For big purchases and inventory. Allocate funds to this account over time so big bills don't catch you by surprise.

- Pass-Through Account: For revenue that is not profit like expense reimbursements. Deposit funds here then transfer them to pay bills. 

- Materials Account: If most of your revenue is pass-through, you may need an account just for materials.

The key is to add accounts as needed to gain a clear and accurate financial picture of your business. This will lead to better decision making. The goal of these advanced techniques is to address challenges before they become crises.

 Here is a summary:

- Set up separate accounts for the specific purposes of your business like materials, contractors, commissions, payroll, equipment, drip income, petty cash, prepayments, and sales tax.

- Allocate funds to these accounts only for their intended purposes. Do not use the money in these accounts for anything else. Move any excess funds at the end of the period to your income account.

- The materials, contractors, and commissions accounts function similarly to the pass-through account but are separated to track the specific expenses. The drip account manages cash flow from income earned over a long period of time. The petty cash and prepayment accounts fund small purchases and pay for services in advance to get discounts. The sales tax account holds sales tax collected to remit to the government.

- Focus on your Required Income for Allocation (RIFA) instead of your “monthly nut.” RIFA is the income you need to deposit each allocation period to pay yourself, cover costs, and make a profit. Calculate RIFA by dividing your monthly income need by two (for the two allocation periods), then dividing by your owner’s compensation percentage. Deposit at least this amount in your income account for each allocation. 

- Review your account balances regularly to ensure you are generating enough income. The income account balance should be rebuilt to your RIFA amount after each allocation. The other account balances provide visibility into the specific areas of your business.

- Document the purpose and process for each account to maintain consistency and provide guidance for anyone else involved, like a bookkeeper. The process should explain how funds are allocated from the income account and when/how money is moved between accounts.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key points about setting up a system of separate accounts for the specific needs of your business and focusing on generating income to fund your allocations? Let me know if you have any other questions.

 Here is a summary:

- Determine the minimum sales revenue required to cover the owners’ living expenses. Divide the total monthly living expenses of owners by 0.31 to get the minimum revenue figure. 

- Assign separate bank accounts for profit and tax holdings to avoid temptation to spend the money. Transfer money from the income account to the profit and tax accounts, then immediately transfer the amounts to separate holding accounts.

- Raising capital is risky and should only be considered if the business is already profitable. The money should be used to amplify existing strategies that work. Keep the funds in a separate “Outside Capital” account until needed. The same applies to loans.

- Use a formula to determine if the business can afford a new employee. Aim for $150,000 to $250,000 in real revenue per full-time employee. For expensive employees like engineers, the real revenue should be 2.5 times the total labor cost. For cheaper labor, the ratio should be 4 times the total labor cost.

- Call the tax account “The Government’s Money” to make it psychologically harder to take money from it. Hide less frequently used accounts online to avoid temptation to transfer funds from them.

- Set up automatic transfers to move funds from outside income accounts like PayPal to the main income account. This ensures those funds are allocated properly.

- Set up automatic notices to receive account balance updates for key accounts like the income, operating expense, and petty cash accounts. Manually check less frequently used accounts. This provides an account “snapshot” to monitor the business’s cash flow. 

- Issue bank checks promptly to avoid missed payments and fees due to forgetting the money had been allocated.

 Here is a summary:

- The ultimate goal of Profit First for your personal finances is financial freedom - being able to do what you want when you want. 
- Your personal finances are linked to your business's finances. You need to apply the Profit First principles to both.
- Face your financial reality by adding up your income, expenses, bills, and debt. Stop increasing your debt.
- Establish a personal Profit First habit by automatically transferring a percentage of your income to retirement savings with every paycheck. Pay off any debt first before increasing the percentage.
- Create "small plates" - separate accounts for different purposes:
-- Income account: Deposit your income here and allocate to other accounts. Don't spend from here.
-- The Vault: Your emergency fund to get through a month if something unexpected happens. Aim for 1 month of rent/mortgage to start, then increase to 8 months of expenses. Make it hard to access. 
-- Day-to-Day accounts: For regular bills and expenses.
-- Big Event accounts: For larger, irregular expenses like vacations or home repairs.

- By applying the Profit First principles, you'll gain control of your personal finances, pay off debt, build wealth, and achieve financial freedom.

 Here's a summary:

- The Vault account is meant to grow over time and eventually generate income through interest. 

- The Recurring Payments account is for paying fixed bills (like rent or mortgage), variable bills (like utilities), and short-term bills (like braces payment plan). Transfer enough each month from the Income account to cover these bills.

- The Day-to-Day account is for variable spending on things like groceries, gas, kids activities, date nights, etc. Transfer money from the Income account twice a month based on individual spending needs. Use debit cards linked to these accounts.

- The Debt Destroyer account receives any remaining funds after other accounts and pays off debt, starting with the smallest balance first. Pay only minimums on other debts until the smallest is paid off. Repeat with next smallest balance.

- For entrepreneurs or those with variable income, keep one credit card for emergencies. Reduce the limit by 50% of any debt paid off each quarter. The goal is to pay off debt, not get lower interest rates.

- It's common for people to slowly cut expenses due to loss aversion and endowment effect. It's better to "rip off the band-aid" and cut most expenses at once. No one really cares about the stuff you own as much as you think. Focus on the 0.01% who truly love and support you.

- Once you start receiving profit disbursements, have a "death to debt" party to pay off as much debt as possible. Throw any extra money at the debt until it's gone. Stay disciplined and focused. Celebrate milestones to stay motivated.

- Paying off debt may take time. Stay committed and consistent. Start with small wins and build momentum. You will get there if you stick to the plan. Focus on being debt-free, not accumulating more stuff.  Freedom from debt is the goal.

 Here is a summary:

The author suggests the following to get motivated to pay off debt:

1. Play energetic music like Metallica’s “Seek and Destroy.” Avoid slow love songs. 

2. Have a drink. Celebrate while paying off debt.

3. Pay off 99% of the profit payment to debt, starting with the smallest debts. Pay them off immediately online or by debit card.

4. Celebrate by saying “Cheers to me!” Dance and enjoy the celebration for 10 minutes. The debt is gone forever.

5. Use the remaining 1% of the profit payment as a reward. Go out for dinner or ice cream. Enjoy and cherish it.

To avoid increasing lifestyle with increasing income (Parkinson’s Law), lock in your lifestyle for 5 years:

1. Always look for free options first. 

2. Buy used instead of new when possible.

3. Never pay full price if you can avoid it. Negotiate and seek alternatives.

4. Delay major purchases. Consider 10 alternatives first. Save splurging for quarterly profit payments.

5. Live a frugal but enjoyable lifestyle. Remove financial stress. Appreciate what you buy more.

Use the Wedge system to gradually upgrade lifestyle with income increases:

Put half of all income increases in the Vault savings fund. The rest can increase your lifestyle budget. Continue allocating a percentage to other Profit First funds like Owner’s Pay and Profit. This allows lifestyle to increase while quickly growing savings.

Teach kids Profit First with a job list and envelopes:

1. Label envelopes for a big dream, supporting family, charity, the Vault, and mad money.

2. Have kids put allocated percentages of job money in each envelope. Teach them to allocate before spending.

3. Let them earn and have fun with mad money. But teach them financial responsibility. 

4. This will teach them to value money, manage it, finance dreams, and avoid entitlement. It’s a gift that will serve them well financially as adults.

The “piggy bank” story shows how Profit First principles can be taught from an early age and have lasting impact.

 Here's a summary:

- The author's daughter, Adayla, was accepted to Virginia Tech, the author's alma mater. When they stopped for lunch at Cracker Barrel on the drive down for orientation, the author brought up a story from when Adayla was nine about offering him the money from her piggy bank. Adayla didn't remember the story at all. The author realized that for Adayla, generosity and financial responsibility were just second nature. 

- The author requires his kids to contribute to paying for college. Adayla doesn't know yet that the last few profit distributions have already paid for her college. The money she's putting toward college is actually going toward her wedding.

- The worst enemy of the Profit First system is you. You have to have the discipline to implement it consistently. The single biggest reason Profit First falls apart is going it alone. Using an accountability partner or group helps you stick to the system.

- Mistake #1: Going it alone. Mistake #2: Implementing Profit First too quickly by allocating too high a percentage of profit at first. It's better to start small and build up slowly. That way you can get used to it and make the necessary efficiency improvements over time.

- The example of Jorge and José: They started by allocating 9% to their Profit Account. That was enough to make a difference but not hinder their strategy of constant innovation, which included paying employees 30% more than competitors to retain top talent.

 Here is a summary:

The key to the success of Profit First is identifying the elements that generate profit, committing to them, and eliminating things that don’t. Jorge and Jose, the business owners in the example, regularly adjust the percentages allocated to the profit account based on short- and long-term needs. 

Mistake 1: Putting too much money in the profit account. This can lead the business back to struggling in the "survival trap."

Mistake 2: Focusing on growth over profit. Many entrepreneurs believe you can have either profit or growth, but not both. However, profit and growth go hand in hand. Profitable companies are able to grow in a sustainable way. Twitter is an example of a company that focused on growth over profit and has lost billions of dollars as a result.

Mistake 3: Cutting the wrong costs. Not all expenses should be cut. Expenses that increase efficiency and improve results should be kept or added. An example is using outdated equipment to save money but producing inconsistent, low-quality results. 

Mistake 4: "Plowing back" and "reinvesting" profits. These are just ways of borrowing money to cover expenses. If a business has to plow back profit to pay for operating expenses, it indicates the expenses are too high. Credit cards should not be used to pay for ongoing expenses.

Mistake 5: Raiding the tax account. As a business becomes more profitable, the taxes owed will increase. The money in the tax account is needed to pay taxes. Spending money from this account because quarterly tax estimates are lower than what's being put in the account will result in an unpleasant surprise at tax time.

The key takeaways are: identify and commit to what generates profit; don't put too much money in the profit account; focus on profit and growth together; cut the right costs; don't borrow from profits or tax accounts to pay expenses; and pay attention to increasing tax obligations as profit increases.

 Here is a summary:

• Your business and profits are growing quickly. This means higher taxes are coming. Be prepared by allocating enough to your TAX account. Do not take money from the TAX account for other purposes.

• Paying off debt can be painful as you have to pay taxes on the income used to pay off the debt. However, the tax benefit was gained when the expenses were originally incurred. Paying off the debt is paying for past spending sins. 

• Do not overcomplicate the Profit First system by adding extra rules or modifying it. Use it as designed - it is meant to be simple. Do not try to outsmart the system.

• You must set up the separate bank accounts for Profit First to work. Simply tracking it through spreadsheets or accounting software will not be effective. The separate accounts put the system in your face and enable real-time management of cash and profits.

• Consider working with a Profit First Professional to help implement and stick to the system. Accountability and support from experts can help avoid mistakes and fallback into old behaviors.

• Have a meeting with your accountant and bookkeeper, ideally Profit First Professionals, to develop a plan for building up your profit and tax allocations while reducing expenses. Check-in quarterly to ensure the plan is on track.

• Just do it - set up your Profit First bank accounts now. Taking action is key to success. Follow the examples of others who have set up their accounts and are seeing the benefits. 

• Profit First may seem strange to others at first, like Rick Barry's granny-style free throw technique. But by implementing it, you increase your odds of success, just like the granny shot improved free throw percentages. Do not be deterred by the fear of looking different or strange. Putting profit first works.

 Here is a summary:

The Profit First system involves setting up separate bank accounts for key areas of your business and allocating your income to those accounts based on percentage targets. This helps ensure profitability and accountability.

One-time setup:

1. Set up 5 checking accounts at your main bank (Bank 1): Income, Profit, Owner's Comp, Tax, Opex

2. Set up 2 savings accounts at a different bank (Bank 2):  Profit Hold, Tax Hold. This removes temptation to "borrow" from these accounts.

3. Determine your Target Allocation Percentages (TAPs) or start with Current Allocation Percentages (CAPs) you can manage this quarter.

Daily:

1. Deposit all income into the Income account. 

2. If using Advanced Profit First, deposit reimbursements, retainers, etc. into respective accounts.

3. Briefly review account balances to monitor cash flow.

Every 10th and 25th:

1. Transfer funds from Income to other Bank 1 accounts based on your CAPs.

2. Transfer Profit to Profit Hold and Tax to Tax Hold at Bank 2, leaving $0 in those Bank 1 accounts.

3. If using Advanced techniques, transfer fixed amounts like payroll from Opex to respective accounts.

4. Pay owner salaries from Owner's Comp, leaving any remainder in that account.  

5. Pay bills from Opex.

Quarterly:

1. Take 50% of Profit Hold as profit distribution. This is for owners, not reinvesting in the business.

2. Pay taxes from Tax Hold.  

3. Meet with your accountant or Profit First Professional to adjust CAPs for maximum financial health. 

Annually: 

1. Review financials with accountants and Profit First Professional.

2. Make year-end contributions to Vault, retirement, capital, etc. as determined with your finance experts.
