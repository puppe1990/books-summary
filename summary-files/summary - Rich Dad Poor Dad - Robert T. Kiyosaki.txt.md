 

The book Rich Dad Poor Dad compares the advice and life lessons the author received from his two dads—one poor and one rich. The rich dad teaches him how to build wealth through investing in assets, businesses, and real estate. The poor dad encourages the author to seek high-paying jobs and work hard to climb the corporate ladder. The contrasting mindsets of the two dads illustrate how financial education and life experiences shape a person's views on money and success. The book suggests that the key to financial freedom is learning about money—how it works, how to invest it, how to take risks, and how to educate yourself financially. Overall, Rich Dad Poor Dad is a starting point for anyone looking to gain control of their financial future.

 

- The author's two fathers had very different attitudes toward money, wealth, and success. 
- One father believed in financial security, job benefits, and avoiding risk. He struggled financially and believed "you cannot be rich."
- The other father believed in financial independence, managing risk, and creating wealth. Although he went through periods of financial hardship, he always considered himself a "rich man."
- At a young age, the author chose to learn about money and success from his "rich dad." This choice ended up shaping his financial philosophy and life path.
- The author's first lesson from his rich dad was that "the rich do not work for money." Instead, they have "money work for them."
- To illustrate this, the author describes a story from when he was nine. He asked his dad how to get rich, and his dad said he would have to "make money." 
- The author and his friend then started a partnership to find ways to make money, eventually coming up with an idea to start a business. 
- The key message is that the wealthy accumulate assets and have money work for them, rather than working for money their whole lives. Building wealth is about making your money work hard, not you.

The key lessons are:

1. Develop an entrepreneurial mindset rather than an employee mindset. Think about building assets and making money work for you.

2. Learn financial skills and education. What you learn about money is more powerful than how much you earn. 

3. Choose your influences wisely. The people you listen to shape your thinking, choices, and outcomes in life.

4. Take calculated risks and learn to manage risk, rather than avoiding it. Risk is necessary for reward.

5. Develop a mindset of abundance and possibility rather than a mindset of scarcity and limits. Your beliefs shape your reality.

 Here is a summary:

- Mike and the narrator are two nine-year-old boys who want to make money. 
- They collect used toothpaste tubes from their neighbors, planning to melt them down to make nickels. 
- However, the narrator's father catches them and explains that this is counterfeiting, which is illegal. Though disappointed, the boys are proud of their creativity.
- The narrator's father suggests they speak to Mike's father, who is rich and successful in business. 
- Mike's father, though busy, agrees to teach them how to make money because they work for him. 
- The boys agree to the offer, eager to learn from Mike's father and become rich.

The key events are:
- The boys hatch an illegal plan to make counterfeit money from toothpaste tubes. 
- They get caught by the narrator's father who applauds their initiative but explains why it is illegal.
- At the narrator's father's suggestion, they approach Mike's father. 
- Mike's father agrees to teach them how to make money if they work for him.

The lessons the boys learn are: 
1) Illegal activities like counterfeiting are wrong, no matter one's intentions. 
2) Success often comes from hard work, creativity, and learning from more experienced people. 
3) Opportunity favors the bold—the boys put themselves in a position to learn from a successful business person by courageously asking him for mentorship.

 Here is a summary:

- The boy works sweeping and dusting cans in Mike's dad's superette for three weeks for 30 cents an hour. 

- He gets frustrated with the tedious work and low pay and decides to quit.

- Mike tells him his dad expected this and wants to meet with him.

- The boy meets with Mike's dad (rich dad) and expresses his anger and frustration over the situation. He says Mike's dad has not kept his promise to teach him about money.

- Rich dad says he has been teaching the boy, just not through direct lectures like in school. He says life always teaches us lessons, even when pushing us around.

- Rich dad says people respond to life in three ways: they let life push them around, they push back and blame others, or they learn the lesson and move on, growing wiser in the process.

- Rich dad tells the boy that if he learns his lessons, he will become wise, wealthy, and happy. If not, he will always blame others for his problems. Moreover, if he is too fearful of taking risks, he will live safely but regret not living.

- The boy begins to understand that rich dad has been teaching him through this experience, giving him a "taste of life." Rich dad says the boy is the first to ask him to teach about money; most employees want jobs and paychecks.

- So the key lesson is that life constantly teaches and pushes us outside our comfort zone. We can either learn and grow from these experiences or blame others and remain stuck. Rich dad is trying to teach the boy through real-world experiences, not just words.

 Here is a summary:

- The narrator's rich dad teaches him a valuable life lesson by only paying him 10 cents an hour to work in his store.

- Most people think the problem is that they need more money, when the problem is their lack of financial education. They work for money instead of learning how to have money work for them.

- Rich dad teaches the narrator that the rich do not pay high taxes like the poor and middle class do because the rich know how money works. The poor and middle class go to school to get a job and then get taxed heavily, remaining in debt their whole lives.

- Rich dad wants to teach the narrator how to have money work for him instead of working for money. He stops paying the narrator to prove that he needs to learn not to work for money.

- The lesson is that most people are slaves to money and think more of it will solve their problems, when the real solution is financial education. Working for money will lead to a lifetime of disappointment and debt. Learning how to have money work for you is a lifetime study, but most people never even start.

 

- Rich dad offers Mike and the author raises from 10 cents to $2 to $5 per hour to work for him, but they turn down the offers. Rich dad is testing them to see if they can be bought and controlled by money and emotions like fear and greed. 

- Rich dad says most people are stuck in a "rat race" - working for money, buying things with it, and working more for money to buy more things. This cycle is driven by fear of insufficient money and greed for material goods. He says people react emotionally to these feelings instead of using logic, so they get trapped.

- Rich dad says the way out of this trap is, to tell the truth about your feelings and not let emotions control you. He says rich and poor people let fear and greed control them; the only difference is that wealthy people have more money. However, money does not necessarily eliminate fear and desire. 

- Rich dad says avoiding money is just as "psychotic" as being overly attached to money. He says it is customary to desire better or more exciting things, but that joy from money is often short-lived. People need more and more to soothe their troubled souls, but money cannot do that.

- The story of the town derelict rummaging for food illustrates that avoiding or chasing money excessively can be a kind of psychosis. The key is to find balance and not let emotions control you.

The main lessons are not
 let fear and greed drive you;
tell the truth about your feelings;
find balance rather than excessively avoiding or chasing money.
True freedom comes from overcoming fear and greed.

 

- The rich dad says most people deny the importance of money while working 8-hour jobs to earn it. He thinks this is psychotic thinking. 
- Emotions drive a lot of our thoughts and actions. We should be aware of our emotions and use them to our advantage instead of letting them control us. 
- Fear is a significant driver for many people. The fear of lack of money drives people to quickly find jobs as a short-term solution, though a job may not solve their financial problems in the long run. 
- Rich dad recommends building financial literacy to overcome fear and ignorance instead of being "slaves to money." 
- Desire also intensifies our emotions and leads to poor decision making. We should delay reactions and reason instead of acting impulsively on desires.
- Ignorance exacerbates fear and desire. Continual learning and an open mind can combat ignorance. While school teaches essential skills, continuous self-education is also essential.
- Rich dad shares examples of how ignorance and greed, amplified by fear and desire, can lead to societal problems like growing inequality and higher living costs. Financial education addresses these systemic issues.

The key message is that we should pursue knowledge and discipline our emotions to overcome ignorance, fear, and greed - which negatively impact individual and societal well-being. Continuous learning and self-awareness are antidotes to these human tendencies.

 

- Rich dad taught the boys financial literacy through real-world experiences, not just theories. He had them work for free in his store to help them understand the concept of making money work for them rather than working for money.

- After working for free for a few weeks, the boys came up with the idea to start a comic book library, where kids could pay to read as many comics as they wanted for two hours. They made $9.50 weekly and paid Mike's sister $1 to run it. Though the library eventually closed, they learned they could make money working for them. 

- Rich dad was excited that the boys had learned this lesson. He told them that it is not how much money you make that matters, but how much money you keep. Financial literacy - knowing how money works - is critical.

- Today, Mike runs Rich Dad's empire, and the author retired at 47. They continue to have financial freedom because their assets grow and generate income automatically.

- The author says that when people ask him for advice, the most important thing he recommends is gaining financial literacy through life experiences, not just reading books. Making money work for you, rather than working for money, is the secret to success.

The key lessons are:

1) Learn financial literacy through real-world experiences, not just theories. 

2) Focus on making your money work for you rather than working for money. This is the secret to financial freedom and success.

3) Gain life experiences to truly understand how money works, not just by reading books. Apply your knowledge in the real world.

4) Start from a young age. Rich dad taught the boys at a young age, preparing them for financial success later on.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- In 1923, some of Chicago's wealthiest and most successful business people met. Within 25 years, many of them went broke or died in poverty. The reasons are unclear but the Great Depression likely had a significant impact. 

- The story is a reminder that great financial success is often fleeting. Changes can happen quickly and unpredictably. Those overly focused on money and needing more financial education will need help. However, being flexible, open-minded, and committed to continuous learning will fare better through the ups and downs.

- The most crucial financial principle is not how much money you make but how much you keep. Many people win money through luck (e.g. lottery) but lose it quickly because they need more financial skills and discipline. 

- To build wealth, you need a solid financial foundation. That starts with financial literacy - understanding the difference between assets and liabilities. Assets put money in your pocket. Liabilities take money out. The wealthy acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities thinking they are assets.

- This critical distinction between assets and liabilities is simple to understand but most people need help to grasp it because of how they were educated. You need to look at the numbers, not just the words. The numbers tell the real story. 

- The diagrams show the cash flow patterns of assets and liabilities. Assets generate income and increase your net worth. Liabilities reduce your income and net worth. By recognizing these patterns, you can make smarter financial decisions.

- Financial literacy and the ability to read numbers are critical to building wealth. The simple lessons from rich dad about assets and liabilities formed a solid financial foundation for the boys. Though simple, these principles are what most people miss.

In summary, through this story and examples, the key message is: build financial literacy, learn the difference between assets and liabilities, make more intelligent choices by understanding numbers not just words, develop flexibility and openness to constant learning, and stay focused on the long game of building wealth - it is not how much you make but how much you keep. You can thrive financially through inevitable booms and busts with the right mindset and skills.

 

The key message is that financial literacy and understanding cash flow are the keys to wealth. The author defines assets as things that put money in your pocket and liabilities as things that take money out of your pocket. The cash flow diagrams show that poor and middle-class people generally have more money flowing out of their pockets, while rich people have more money flowing into their pockets from assets.

Increasing your income will not solve financial problems if you spend more as your income rises. Many highly educated professionals struggle financially due to a lack of financial education. They know how to work hard but need to learn how to have their money work for them.

The story of the young couple shows how this happens. As their incomes rise, so do their taxes and expenses. They buy a house and go into debt. Their liabilities rise. They get trapped in a cycle of working harder to afford their lifestyle but not getting ahead financially. More money will not solve the root problem of how they choose to spend it.

The three powers are the sword (military might), the jewel (money), and the mirror (self-knowledge). The power of money controls most people due to a need for more financial understanding and literacy. They follow the crowd rather than think for themselves. The mirror, or self-knowledge, is the most valuable but least used of the three powers. Fear, especially fear of being different, prevents people from seeking new solutions to their problems. Financial freedom comes from gaining self-knowledge about money and not being controlled by its power.

In summary, the key insights are
spend your life buying assets, not liabilities;
increase your financial literacy;
understand your cash flow does, not;
 be controlled by the power of money; and
have the self-knowledge to think for yourself.
Following these principles can lead to financial freedom.

 Summary: The saying "play it safe" is common but can lead to financial mediocrity or struggle. Many people are highly educated and successful in their careers. However, they need to be financially literate and make poor financial decisions based on fear, trying to keep up with others, or accepting popular opinions without scrutiny. 

The story provides examples of the author and his friend learning financial education early by listening to the friend's father's business meetings. In contrast, the author's father, a teacher, argued that their house was an investment and that the key to financial success was getting good grades and a high-paying job. The author disagreed and showed how a house is a liability, not an asset, due to the outflow of cash required for mortgage payments, taxes, and upkeep.

The story outlines how many people spend their lives paying off one mortgage after another to buy bigger houses, missing the opportunity to invest their money and build tangible assets. Home ownership is good but only sometimes the best investment. Some homeowners end up owing more than their house is worth. 

The key is understanding the difference between assets and liabilities and building up income-producing assets early on so that money works for you rather than you working for money. The rich get richer by minimizing liabilities, maximizing assets, and reinvesting profits into more assets. The middle class struggles financially because they treat their home as an asset, spend raises rather than investing them, accumulate debt, and rely on increasingly uncertain sources like jobs, Social Security, and mutual funds. 

In summary, "playing it safe" by avoiding financial education and risk often leads to riskier financial outcomes. Gaining financial literacy early, building assets, and adopting an investor mindset are safer than blindly following popular opinion or spending beyond your means to keep up with others. Financial education allows you to make smarter decisions, generate passive income, and gain financial freedom.

 

The key message is that you must mind your business to become financially independent. This means focusing on acquiring income-generating assets, not just increasing your paycheck. 

Most people work their whole lives for others, making those people rich while they end up with trim. They work first for business owners, then the government through taxes, and then banks through mortgage payments. They confuse their profession, the job they do for someone else, with their business.

Going to school often prepares you to get a job working for someone else. While education is valuable, many people become what they study and spend their lives working to make someone rich rather than building their asset base.

The vibrant focus is on their asset columns, the assets that generate income for them, not just their income statements or paychecks. Saying you need a raise, promotion, more training, or another job is not the solution. You need to mind your own business, focus on acquiring assets, and gain financial independence through the income from those assets.

The essential habits and mindsets to develop are:

1. Distinguish clearly between an asset and a liability. Assets generate income, liabilities generate expenses.

2. Focus on acquiring income-generating assets, not increasing your paycheck. Build your own business. 

3. Gain financial freedom through the income from your assets, not by climbing the corporate ladder or getting more degrees to get a higher-paying job.

4. Mind your own business. Stop working to make someone else rich while you end up with little. Build your own financial foundation and resource base.

5. Know the difference between your profession, the job you do for someone else, and your business, your asset column. Refrain from mistaking one for the other.

That covers the key highlights and main takeaways from the summary. Please let me know if you would like me to explain anything in the summary in more detail.

 

- Most people focus on their income and spend money on things that lose value quickly, rather than building wealth through acquiring income-generating assets. 

- Struggling financially often results from working for money rather than having money work for you through assets. People cling to jobs for security and do not take financial risks.

- Assets that people think will provide financial security, like homes and cars, often become liabilities that cost money. Personal assets usually cannot be sold for their estimated value.

- Building wealth requires diligently acquiring income-generating assets, keeping expenses low, and avoiding liabilities. Young people should learn the difference between assets and liabilities to avoid debt and financial struggles.

- Assets include businesses, stocks, bonds, real estate, intellectual property, and anything that generates income or appreciation. Only acquire assets you understand and care about to manage them properly.

- Keeping a steady job while building your assets through your business is best. Starting a business is risky, so only do so if you are passionate about it. Otherwise, focus on building assets.

- Use increased income from assets to reward yourself with luxuries, not debts. Luxuries should be enjoyed after establishing financial security through assets.

- The rich utilize corporations and tax laws to build wealth to bypass the "Robin Hood" idea of taking from the rich to give to the poor. Following their lead can help others find financial success.

The key ideas are
acquire income-generating assets;
avoid liabilities and debt;
build wealth through your own business and assets, not just a job;
use money from assets to fund rewards and luxuries; and
take advantage of tax and corporate laws like the wealthy do.
Following this formula can lead to financial security and success.

 

- Originally, there were no income taxes in England and America. They were temporary and used to fund wars. In 1874, England established the first permanent income tax. The US followed in 1913 with the 16th Amendment.

- These income taxes were initially targeting the rich. The idea was to "punish" the rich and the masses supported it. However, the government's appetite for money soon grew and the taxes expanded to the middle and poor class. 

- The speaker's rich dad believes government workers are lazy thieves while his educated dad believes the government should help people. The speaker struggled with these opposing views from his fathers.

- The rich saw an opportunity in corporations to limit personal liability. By putting money in corporations, their losses were limited to the money invested in that corporation. The corporate structure allowed the rich to shield their wealth.

- As government spending grew, the demand for money increased. The "tax-the-rich" idea expanded to include the middle and poor classes. The rich used corporations to escape high individual income tax rates. Corporations allowed them to pay less in taxes.

- The battle between the rich and others has been ongoing for hundreds of years. The rich use their resources and knowledge to minimize their tax burden through legal loopholes and incentives in the tax code. The poor and middle class pay more in taxes proportionally because they do not take advantage of these legal maneuvers. 

- The speaker is shocked at how many people pay more taxes due to fear of the government. Although the government can make mistakes, the amount of taxes most people pay (working January through May to pay taxes) needs to be lowered. The rich, on the other hand, play the game smarter through corporations.

- In summary, the main point is that while the income tax system was set up to punish the rich, the rich have found ways around it using their knowledge of legal tax loopholes and incentives. The poor and middle class are shouldering most of the tax burden due to their lack of this financial knowledge and fear of governmental authority.

 Here is a summary of the key lessons:

1. Knowledge is power. If you have financial knowledge and literacy, you have power over your financial situation and life. Without that knowledge, you are more easily pushed around and bullied by forces like the tax man. 

2. Money working for you is more powerful than you working for money. You gain more control and power when your money works for you through assets. When you work for money through a job, you give power to your employer.

3. Own the corporation, do not be an employee. Most of your income goes to pay taxes and expenses as an employee. As a business owner, you have more control and flexibility over how money is made and spent. You can build wealth faster as a business owner.

4. Develop your financial IQ through accounting, investing, understanding markets, and law. These four areas provide the knowledge and skills to gain wealth and financial freedom. Financial IQ allows your money to make more money.

5. Use legal entities like corporations for protection and tax benefits. Corporations provide legal ways to reduce taxes and protect your assets. The wealthy can amass money while controlling little personal assets through corporations and trusts. 

6. The rich invent money. The bold and financially savvy can generate wealth and income through assets and business. While the less financially literate work for linear income through jobs, the wealthy build assets and income streams. Money is invented by providing value to others, not just by earning an income through labor.

The key lessons from the summary are about gaining financial knowledge, building assets through corporations and business, and ultimately gaining wealth's power, control, and security. Linear income from jobs is limited, but money can be "invented" by the financially intelligent through assets that generate income. The bold and financially savvy find ways to build wealth, while those without financial IQ are more prone to struggle financially.

 Here is a summary:

- The author watched a TV program about Alexander Graham Bell and how he had difficulties keeping up with the demand for the telephone after he patented it. He offered to sell his patent and company to Western Union for $100,000, but they turned him down, thinking it was too expensive. AT&T ended up being formed as a result.

- The news featured a story of a local company doing layoffs. A 45-year-old manager who had just bought a new house begged to keep his job but was fired. The author said this illustrated how excessive fear and self-doubt hold people back.

- The author has taught since 1984 and has seen that while people have great potential, self-doubt is the biggest impediment to success. What determines someone's future is not grades or degrees but characteristics like guts, courage, and daring. Everyone has within them both bold, brave, brilliant characters as well as characters that can beg if necessary. 

- The author encourages students to take risks and overcome fear to achieve their potential. Most people would rather play it safe regarding money, but developing your financial intelligence gives you more options. Significant changes are coming in business and the economy, and opportunities and problems will emerge. It is an exciting time if you choose to develop your financial IQ.

- The author uses a board game he created called CASHFLOW to teach people how money works. In one class, a woman got frustrated playing the game because she did not understand the math and realized the "boat" she bought in the game was costing her money. She demanded her money back, refusing to see the game as a reflection of her life. However, she later calmed down and could see some parallels between her life and decisions in the game. 

- The author has made millions teaching through interactive games rather than lectures. Games provide instant feedback that can reflect someone's behavior and knowledge in a personalized way. 

- An example is the woman who later realized she avoided finances and responsibility for the money in her marriage, leaving it to her husband. After 20 years, they had little to show for it in the divorce. She was embarrassed about not understanding finances and angry at herself for not knowing her ex-husband had been hiding money. Life, like games, provides instant feedback if we pay attention.

 Here is a summary:

• The CASHFLOW game provides feedback on players' financial behaviors and teaches them to explore multiple financial options. Successful players are numerically literate and creative in generating options.

• Limiting your options limits your success. The author's friend works three jobs because he only saw the option of working hard after losing his main job. Successful people see and act on more options.

• In the game and life, some people wait passively for opportunities, lack money to act on opportunities, or fail to recognize opportunities. Financial intelligence means having the creativity to generate more options and solutions.

• Money is an agreement, not something real and finite. With financial intelligence, you can generate money through agreements and exchanging nothing tangible. 

• The author develops his financial intelligence to participate in the fast-paced world of money creation. He wants to avoid being left behind in an era where people can generate wealth with their minds.

• In the 1990s, the author generated $190,000 in assets by buying inexpensive houses, advertising them at a markup, and selling them, keeping the difference. This took little time and created money through agreements, not labor. Saving the same amount would have taken much longer.

• The example shows how financial intelligence can be used to invent and protect money. Agreements and a little work generated a good income stream for the author.

That covers the key highlights from the summary on using financial intelligence to generate wealth. Please let me know if you want me to explain or expand on any summary part.

 

- The author buys a $45,000 house for $40,000 by finding a distressed seller. He puts $5,000 down and rents it out, earning $40 monthly in cash flow after expenses.

- A year later, the real estate market picks up and he sells the house for $95,000, making a $40,000 capital gain. He uses a 1031 tax-deferred exchange to buy a 12-unit apartment building for $300,000 that is worth $450,000. 

- Two years later, he sells the 12-unit building for $495,000 using another 1031 exchange and buys a 30-unit building in Phoenix for an undisclosed price.

- The key points the author wants to convey are:

1) Take the time to develop your financial intelligence through accounting, investing, understanding markets, and law. This creates opportunities to build wealth.

2) Investments and markets are constantly changing. Continually develop your financial knowledge to identify new opportunities and adapt. 

3) Use real-world examples to show how anyone can achieve financial success through simple means if they have a solid financial education. The examples are meant to inspire and demonstrate that building wealth is achievable.

4) The author uses real estate and small-cap stocks as his primary investment vehicles. He buys real estate for cash flow and stocks for fast growth. 

5) There are many ways to achieve financial goals. The examples show that it does not require complexity or being a genius. Find opportunities, gain the necessary knowledge, and take action.

6) Changes in the economy and world often create new financial opportunities. Developing your financial intelligence allows you to see opportunities others may miss and benefit from.

7) The story of buying the little blue house is meant to show how finding a motivated or distressed seller and acting quickly can lead to a good deal and capital gains. Continually looking for new opportunities is critical.

 Here is a summary:

- The real estate market in Phoenix was depressed, allowing the author to purchase a 30-unit apartment building for $875,000, with a down payment of $225,000. 
- The monthly cash flow from rent was $5,000. A few years later, an investor offered $1.2 million for the building. 
- The example shows how a small investment can grow into a large amount over time. You must understand financial statements, investment strategies, market trends, and laws to achieve this. 
- If you need this knowledge, you must rely on standard advice like playing it safe, diversifying, and choosing secure investments. However, "secure" investments often have lower gains.
- Larger brokerages avoid speculative deals to protect clients. The most profitable deals are reserved for sophisticated investors. Though illegal, inexperienced people are sometimes offered speculative deals. 
- Becoming more financially sophisticated opens you up to more opportunities. The more you learn, the more money you can make through experience and wisdom. 
- The author takes a small seed investment approach, starting small and seeing what grows. Their real estate corporation now owns millions in property that began as $5,000-$10,000 investments. 
- They also own a stock portfolio that began as private, pre-IPO companies. For example, investing $25,000 in a company can turn into $1 million in under a year if the company is well-managed. 
- While risky for most, this approach works with enough knowledge and experience. The key is using your knowledge and judgment to minimize risk. What is risky for one person may not be for another. 
- Gaining financial education is the best way to improve your odds. The brighter you are, the better you can spot good and bad deals.
- Real estate is the author's foundation, providing steady cash flow and asset growth. Stock market gains are reinvested in real estate for stability. 
- Good real estate deals exist everywhere if you know how to find them. Lack of knowledge, not lack of deals, stops most people from getting wealthy.
- First, follow the ten steps the author used to achieve financial freedom. However, most of all, have fun learning the rules of investing and building your assets. Losses are part of the process. 
- There are two types of investors: 
1. Those who buy packaged investments like mutual funds, REITs, stocks, or bonds. This is a simple approach but yields lower gains.  
2. Those who create investments by assembling the right components, like building a computer. This approach is riskier but can yield higher rewards. 
- To be the second type of investor, develop three skills:
1. Find opportunities others miss by seeing with your mind, not just your eyes. 
2. Raise money in ways beyond just borrowing from a bank. 
3. Have the skills to complete a deal, whether fixing up a house or starting a business. 
- Following the rules and taking a disciplined approach minimizes risks for the entrepreneurial investor. Start small, learn the skills, and build up.

 

The author was being interviewed by a reporter in Singapore. When the reporter said she aspired to be a bestselling author but was struggling, the author suggested she develop complementary skills like sales and marketing. The reporter was offended at the suggestion that she learn sales. 

The author pointed out that he is called a "bestselling author," not a "bestwriting author." He admitted he could be a better writer but has learned sales and marketing. He said most people are just "one skill away from great wealth" if they can learn skills that complement their primary skill. 

The author used the example of a young mechanic who could quickly fix his car by listening. However, many talented people earn little money. He said doctors, dentists, and chiropractors often need more business and financial skills.

The author chose the title "If You Want to Be Rich and Happy, Do not Go to School" for his first book to gain publicity, not because he is anti-education. He values education but believes the system needs reform.

The author graduated from a merchant marine academy but turned down a high-paying job with an oil company to join the Marine Corps and learn to fly. His educated father was disappointed, but his wealthy father congratulated him.

Most people think you need to specialize in school and jobs to gain more pay or promotion. However, the author's wealthy father advised him to "know a little about a lot." The author worked in accounting, construction, sales, and more in his wealthy father's companies to learn about various business aspects.

When the author quit his high-paying oil company job, his educated father could not understand. The author could not fully explain but realized his desire for freedom and not wanting to specialize or be trapped in an enormous bureaucracy. His wealthy father understood and encouraged the author to pursue his dreams.

 

The author had two dads - an educated dad who believed in job security and a rich dad who believed in continuous learning and taking business risks. The author followed the advice of the rich dad.

The author's educated dad thought the author went to school to become a ship officer. However, the rich dad knew the author went to school to study international trade. So, the author worked on cargo ships and learned about trade, culture, and business in Asia instead of partying in college.

The educated dad did not understand why the author quit to join the Marines. However, the rich dad said it was to learn leadership essential for running a company. After the Marines, the author overcame his fear of rejection by working in sales for Xerox. 

In 1977, the author started his first company sourcing wallets from Asia and selling in New York. The rich dad said it is best to go broke before 30 so you have time to recover. The author's company shipped its first order just before his 30th birthday.

The author says job stands for "just over broke" which applies to people who work to pay bills and never get ahead. People should seek work to learn skills, not just earn money. Otherwise, they end up like hamsters spinning in a wheel. 

The author asks where people's daily work activity is taking them. He cites a retirement expert who says if people do not have enough for retirement, they can "blow their brains out." Retirement is risky today without defined benefit plans. Add in medical and nursing care costs and the future is frightening for many.

The author recommends taking a long-term view of life and learning new skills, not just working for money. He suggests joining a network marketing company to learn sales skills. However, most people make excuses to avoid learning new things. Instead, they would give half their money to the government rather than try to learn.

The author says changing is challenging but life is like going to the gym. The hardest part is deciding to go, but you feel better after. Learn new skills, or if you overspecialize, work for a unionized company that will protect you since your skills will not transfer. The author's educated dad became a union head, while the rich dad fought against unions.

The key message is to take a lifelong learning approach to work to avoid becoming trapped in the rat race or being at the mercy of a single specialized career. Continuously acquire new skills that will benefit you financially and in many areas of life.

 

• Skills and their importance vary significantly across industries and jobs. Pilots have specialized skills highly valued in the airline industry but not elsewhere. Doctors and teachers also have skills that are specialized to their fields. 

• Highly specialized jobs often depend on unions to protect them because their skills do not have much value outside their field. Teachers unions in particular have much political influence. 

• While many people may have skills that could yield a better product or service, that does not translate to business success. Business systems and sales/marketing skills are more critical to success than technical skills alone.

• The author's artist friend failed at advertising because he lacked business and marketing skills, not because of the advertising itself. Many talented people remain poor due to a lack of business knowledge.

• The critical skills for success are managing cash flow, managing systems, and managing people. Sales and marketing skills are the most important specialized skills. 

• It is better to have broad knowledge across areas than to overspecialize. While specialization has benefits, it can limit your options and make you dependent on a single field. 

• Success requires the ability to both teach and learn. Giving to others through teaching, charitable works, or other means is vital to receiving more.

• The author learned from both his educated dad and his rich dad. He believes the education system is responsible for the widening gap between the rich and the poor.

• The primary obstacle between financially literate people and success is fear, especially of losing money. While fear affects everyone, how you handle fear determines your success level. It is possible to overcome fear and still become wealthy.

That covers the key highlights and main takeaways from the summary. Please let me know if you want me to explain or expand on any summary part.

 

• The difference between starting to invest at 20 versus 30 is enormous due to the power of compound interest. Investing $24 at 8% annually from age 20 to 65 can grow to $28 trillion. However, waiting until 30 would be significantly less at retirement. The key is to start early to take advantage of compounding.

• Most people do not become rich because they are too afraid of losing money. However, losing and failure are part of winning. Winners are not afraid to lose. They have the mindset that losing will only make them better. Losers avoid losing and risks altogether. 

• Texans are good examples of people who are not afraid of losing. They live amply and lose significantly. When they lose, they turn it into inspiration. Instead of hiding their failures, they get motivated by them. The Alamo story is a good example. Texans turned a failure into a rallying cry. 

• Failure inspires winners but defeats losers. Winners like Rockefeller and Edison turned failures into opportunities. The Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor ended up awakening and inspiring America. Failure only motivates winners to work harder and get better.

• Most people play it safe with their money to avoid losing. Instead of focusing on a few good opportunities, they put their eggs in many baskets. If you want to win big, you need to focus and not be balanced in your approach. It would help if you took risks. Balance and playing it safe lead to mediocrity.

• To build wealth, you need to overcome cynicism and self-doubt. Do not be like Chicken Little and spread doom. Do not let what others say stop you. Take risks and do not be afraid to lose or fail. Learn from your failures instead of being defeated by them. With a winning mindset, you can build wealth by focusing on good opportunities.

The key is having the right mindset - take risks, not be afraid to lose or fail, learn from failures, and stay focused. Compounding works miracles but you need time. Start early and think long-term. Do not listen to cynics but follow your dreams. With this, you can build wealth.

 Here is a summary:

• Doubts, fears and warnings of impending doom or failure (referred to as "noise") often paralyze people and stop them from taking action. This results in missed opportunities and staying stuck in the status quo. 

• Examples of "noise" include: warnings about nuclear war in the 1950s, increases in gun sales after the violence, drops in the stock market, etc. These often turn out to be irrational fears not supported by facts.

• The author shares examples of friends and acquaintances who failed to take action on investment opportunities due to doubts and fears, only to miss out on substantial financial gains. He argues that "noise" and risk aversion often stem from a "Chicken Little" mentality focused on avoiding potential loss rather than gaining rewards.

• Successful investors can tune out the "noise" and objectively analyze opportunities. They accept risks and potential losses while taking measures to minimize losses. This allows them to take action when others are paralyzed by fear.

• The author argues that saying "I do not want to..." often signifies this doubting and fearful mentality. For example, saying, "I do not want to fix toilets," prevents someone from investing in real estate. Successful investors instead figure out solutions, like hiring a property manager, to overcome their objections. 

• Colonel Sanders is an example of someone who persevered in constant rejection and doubt, demonstrating the tenacity and courage required to overcome obstacles. His ability to "fry the chicken" means overcoming doubts and forging ahead.

• In summary, excessive doubt, cynicism, and risk aversion due to fear of potential losses represent a "Chicken Little" mentality that often paralyzes inaction. Overcoming this requires tuning out "noise," objectively analyzing information, accepting risks while minimizing losses, and demonstrating courage and tenacity in facing obstacles or rejection. Acting despite fears and doubts can lead to opportunity and financial gain.

 Here is a summary:

The man was too busy at work to focus on his relationship and family. As a result, his wife left him and took the kids. Distraught, his work performance declined, and he lost his job. 

The story illustrates a common problem: people stay busy to avoid dealing with issues they do not want to avoid facing. Whether staying busy with work, hobbies, TV, or other things, it is a form of laziness through constant activity and distraction.

The author recommends developing "a little greed" - thinking about what you want and how to achieve it to overcome this laziness. Saying "I cannot afford it" shuts down your mind, whereas asking "How can I afford it?" sparks motivation and ideas—some greed and self-interest fuel progress. Excessive greed, of course, is terrible. However, it would help if you had greed and desire to motivate yourself and achieve goals.

The author also recommends paying yourself first before paying bills or other obligations. This builds the habit and motivates you to earn more to pay the other bills. Paying yourself last means you feel little motivation or pressure to earn more. Paying yourself first, even when money is tight, builds the habit and pushes you to earn more. You can start with even a tiny amount. The fear of not paying the bills spurs you into action to earn more.

In summary, the key points are:

1) Avoid laziness through constant activity and distraction. Face issues directly.

2) Develop "a little greed" - think of your wants and needs and how to achieve them. This motivates progress. 

3) Build the habit of paying yourself first before paying other bills. This motivates you to earn more and gain financial strength. You are paying yourself last leads to weakness.

4) Use the fear of not paying bills as motivation to earn more. Take action rather than give in. Build financial and mental toughness.

5) Like exercising, building these financial habits takes determination and repetition. However, it leads to freedom and strength.

- Finding great deals and making money requires developing your financial intelligence. Most people's financial intelligence remains dormant as they are educated to work for money rather than have money work for them.

- The author shares ten steps to awaken your financial genius:

1. Find a strong reason or purpose to motivate you beyond the challenges. With motivation, the journey will seem more manageable. 

2. Make choices daily to shape your financial future. Your choices reflect who you are. Choose to spend time and money acquiring assets and learning.

3. Invest in education first before other assets. Your mind is your most powerful tool. Read books, take courses, and listen to audio on investing and money. Review and repeat what you learn. Look at concepts from multiple perspectives. 

4. Be humble and open-minded. Learn from those more financially successful than you. Their wisdom can accelerate your learning. Arrogance limits learning and risk-taking.

- In summary, finding and taking advantage of financial opportunities requires motivation, dedication to learning, intelligent choices, and an open and humble mindset. With the right mindset and perseverance, anyone can develop their financial genius.

 

- Arrogant and ignorant people rarely listen to experts or new ideas contradicting their beliefs. Intelligent and wise people are open-minded and willing to consider other perspectives.

- The author takes a long-term view on building wealth through continuous learning and education. Buying assets like houses or stocks does not necessarily make one an expert in those areas or grant financial success. Accurate financial intelligence comes from educating yourself in various areas of knowledge.

- Choose your friends wisely. Associate with people who share your financial values and goals. Be wary of listening to poor or fearful people who will try to discourage you from new opportunities or think negatively. Look for people who will expand your mind. 

- Master a formula for making money, but always be willing to learn new formulas and ways of thinking. Continuous learning and improving your knowledge are vital. The specific formulas or methods you use can change, but the process of educating yourself never stops.

- Develop self-discipline in managing money, time, and people. This is one of the most essential habits for becoming financially successful. "Pay yourself first" means putting money towards your financial goals before spending it on other things. This requires discipline.

- In summary, the primary keys to financial success, according to the author, are continuous learning, associating with like-minded successful people, being open to new ideas, developing useful money-making formulas, and strict self-discipline over yourself and your resources. Mastery these concepts can lead to a lifetime of financial security and independence.

 

• Financial literacy allows one to understand financial statements and numbers, which reflect a person's financial behaviors and choices. By analyzing someone's income statement and balance sheet, you can see if they follow the advice of "pay yourself first."

• Diagrams showing the accounts of people who pay themselves first versus those who do not reveal critical differences. Those who pay themselves first allocate money to assets before paying expenses. Most people do the opposite and pay themselves last. 

• Paying yourself first requires financial discipline and courage to go against the norm. It means paying bills last but being responsible enough not to get into too much debt. When cash flow is short, letting creditors pressure you can inspire you to generate more income. But this only works if you don't give in by dipping into savings or investments to pay bills.

• Some tips for successfully paying yourself first:

1. Avoid large consumer debts. Keep expenses low and build up assets first before big purchases.

2. When money is short, use the pressure to motivate yourself to create more income. Do not refrain from investing in savings or investments to pay bills. 

3. Being an "Indian giver" means getting something for nothing. Look for ways to acquire valuable information and benefits at little to no cost. Pay professionals like brokers, accountants, and attorneys well because their services can make you money. However, choose professionals who educate you and share your financial interests.

• Management skills involve managing people more intelligent than yourself. Select brokers, accountants, attorneys, and other professionals carefully based on their financial success and acumen. Be willing to compensate them if their services are making you money generously. See them as part of your "board of directors."

• Learn from the cultural mistake of early European settlers by understanding the Native American practice of giving gifts with the expectation that the item may be requested back when needed. Look for ways to benefit at little cost, with the option to withdraw when necessary. Develop an attitude of abundance and generosity that ultimately rewards.

 

The sophisticated investor focuses on how quickly they can recover their capital and what assets they can acquire for free. The return on investment (ROI) and acquiring free assets is vital. For example, the author invested $50,000 in a foreclosed condo, earned back the money in three years through rent, and now owns a free asset generating monthly income. The same principle applies to stocks - investing fast to acquire shares, earning back the capital quickly, and keeping any shares gained for free. Although losses happen, the author limits the risk to the initial investment. 

The power of focus is critical. Rather than simply buying luxuries, the author had his friend's son focus on learning how to invest to earn a car. After losing money, the son's interest and learning soared. The experience built financial intelligence and the power to direct money to make more money. Most people lose money or make minimal gains, but some gain huge returns through focus and discipline. Success requires mental fortitude to avoid temptations and direct money to the proper uses.

Choosing heroes to emulate is critical. As kids, we learn from sports heroes, copying their habits and statistics. The author follows investing heroes like Warren Buffett and Donald Trump, learning their strategies and mindsets. Heroes make things look easy, inspiring and convincing us that we can do the same. Emulation is a powerful form of learning.

Finally, teaching and giving to others is critical. The author's rich dad taught him the importance of charity and giving. When you teach, you learn. You gain far more in return by giving others knowledge and skills, exceptionally the less fortunate. It makes you feel good, keeps your mind active, and promotes the circulation of wealth. Most of all, it makes a difference in other lives.

In summary, the main points are recovering capital quickly, gaining free assets, limiting losses, focused learning, choosing heroes, and giving to others. These are the keys to building wealth and financial intelligence.

 Here is a summary:

•Rich dad generously gave money and education to help others. He believed in giving to receive and that people must give to meet their needs. 

•When rich dad was short of money, he gave to his church or charity. He said if you want something, give what you want first, and you will receive it in abundance.

•Rich dad said poor people are more greedy than rich people. Rich people provide value to others. When you feel needy, give what you want to others, and you will receive it.

•Teaching and being generous with your knowledge makes you smarter. Helping others reach where you are is the key. There are more extraordinary powers that can help when you help others.

•My rich dad gave to teachers and became a master teacher himself. His generosity with knowledge made him wiser. Helping others makes you smarter.

 

•Profit is made when you buy, not when you sell. Look for good deals and opportunities to buy assets at a discount.

•Think big. Do not limit yourself to what you can afford. Look at the bigger picture and find ways to acquire more significant assets. Then break them into smaller pieces. This allows you to get a better overall deal. 

•Learn from history. Study how large successful companies and individuals have built wealth over time. They started small but thought big. Take action and build up your assets over the long run.

•Action beats inaction. You have to take action to build wealth. Thinking about it or waiting for the right opportunity will not get you anywhere. Take action now.

•Convert earned income into passive or portfolio income. Earned income from your job is the highest taxed. Passive income from real estate or business investments and portfolio income from stock dividends and capital gains are taxed much less. Build up these income streams to achieve financial freedom.

•Education and financial intelligence are essential. Read books, take classes, and learn investing strategies and skills. Start small while you are learning, and build up from there. With time and practice, you can achieve a lot.

•Money is an idea. Do not think it takes much money to make money. You can start with a small quantity of cash and turn it into something much more significant through intelligent investments and building up your assets over time. Play it smart, not safe. Take calculated risks to achieve higher rewards.

•There are three main types of income: ordinary earned, portfolio, and passive. The key to wealth is converting your earned income into passive and portfolio income streams. The government taxes earned income the highest, so building up other income sources will benefit you both financially and reduce your tax burden.

The main takeaway is using your financial intelligence to build up passive and portfolio income sources so your money is working hard for you and not the other way around. Think big, take action, learn all you can, and convert your earned income into more lucrative income streams that can ultimately lead to financial freedom. Build your assets and income through education, experience, and intelligent investing.

 

- Robert Kiyosaki advocates acquiring passive and portfolio income through investing in assets instead of solely relying on earned income. 
- Kiyosaki believes financial education is critical to gaining the skills required to build wealth. He and his wife founded a financial education company that creates books, games, and other products to teach people financial literacy and investment skills.
- Their CASHFLOW games aim to teach players how to convert earned income into passive and portfolio income by building business and investment skills. The games teach accounting, investing, and wealth-building principles.
- Kiyosaki argues that while his educational products may seem expensive, the knowledge and skills they provide are more valuable than the cost. He believes most people do not build wealth because they lack financial education and need to understand how to acquire and protect different types of income.
- Kiyosaki distinguishes between three types of income: earned, passive, and portfolio. Earned income comes from wages, passive income comes from investments like real estate, and portfolio income comes from the stock market. The wealthy acquire passive and portfolio income, while most rely solely on earned income.
- Kiyosaki advocates taking control of your financial education and destiny by building wealth through acquiring assets and investing. He believes each dollar and each day presents an opportunity to choose to be rich, middle class, or poor based on how you spend and invest your money.
- The editor's note provides context around how Kiyosaki's messages and predictions have unfolded since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published. His views were initially met with skepticism but have proven prescient, as evidenced by events like the financial crisis. While the investment landscape has changed, Kiyosaki's core teachings around financial education and building wealth through assets and investing remain relevant.

 Here is a summary of the steps from the Preface:

Step 1: It is Time to Mind Your Own Business 
- The path is the goal in life, not a profession or job
- Finding your path means finding your life's purpose and the gift you give to life
- The author found his path by trusting his intuition and inner guidance

Step 2: Take Control of Your Cash Flow
- In 1973, at 26, the author knew traditional schooling and jobs were not his paths
- He began educating himself in real estate, business, and personal development
- A personal development course showed him the need for mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual education 
- Traditional schools focused primarily on mental development, which is why many students struggle in life and with money

Step 3: Know the Difference Between Risk and Risky
- The author realized he loved learning but hated traditional school 
- School's motivation through fear and trying to make students into employees crushed his spirit
- This is why many entrepreneurs drop out of traditional education

Step 4: Decide What Kind of Investor You Want to Be 
- The author's previous education and environment as a Marine was very harsh, developing him mentally and physically but lacking emotional and spiritual development
- A personal development seminar allowed him to develop emotionally and spiritually, becoming kinder and more compassionate
- After this experience, the author knew traditional education was not for him anymore

Step 5: Seek Mentors 
- The author committed to continuing self-development to become a better person rather than studying for degrees, jobs, or promotions

Step 6: Make Disappointment Your Strength
- Leaving the personal development seminar and returning to the harsh environment of being a Marine pilot was difficult
- But the author knew developing emotionally and spiritually was what he needed to do, even though it went against his previous training

Step 7: The Power of Faith
- The author had faith in following his intuition and path of self-development

 

The author grew up in a family that highly valued formal education and credentials. As a result, he pursued higher education and advanced degrees. However, he eventually became disillusioned with traditional education and began exploring self-development and personal growth outside of school. He became curious about why so many students dislike school, and traditional education often fails to prepare people for success in life. 

The author believes finding one's path or purpose in life is more about following your heart and passion than following a prescribed course of study. He shares the story of a former classmate who became a successful yet unhappy lawyer. Although the classmate earned a high income, he felt unfulfilled and trapped in a job he disliked. The author started his own education company to provide financial education and help people transition into becoming business owners and investors.

Changing life paths and moving into entrepreneurship and investing was challenging for the author due to his family's traditional values around education, careers, and money. It required significant work on his emotional and spiritual development to overcome their doubts and criticism. Similarly, success in any field requires more than physical or mental effort. Emotional, spiritual, and mental development are all required to make permanent changes.

The author argues that many academically successful "A" students struggle in the real world of money because they lack emotional education and life skills. They become stuck in "analysis paralysis" and fear making mistakes. However, learning from mistakes and failures is essential to success. While formal education focuses on minimizing errors, real-world success requires taking risks, taking action, and learning from inevitable failures and setbacks. The key message is that finding purpose and achieving success in life requires the development of our whole being—mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual. Success is more about following our passion and purpose than the course of study we choose.

 

- The CASHFLOW Quadrant shows four ways in which people earn an income: as employees (E), self-employed (S), business owners (B), and investors (I). 
- The author's poor dad recommended becoming self-employed and seeking job security. His rich dad recommended becoming a business owner or investor, seeking financial freedom.
- This book is for those seeking to transition from the left side (E and S) to the right side (B and I) of the quadrant. Though the journey is difficult, the right side offers a path to financial freedom.
- The story of Bill and Ed illustrates the difference between the left side and right side. Ed works hard hauling buckets of water as an employee, while Bill builds a pipeline as a business owner and enjoys financial freedom. 
- The author asks himself whether he is building pipelines or hauling buckets, working hard or working smart. The answers have led him to financial freedom. 
- This book is about making the mental, emotional, and educational transition to escape the vicious cycle of needing a steady paycheck and instead achieving financial freedom.

In summary, the CASHFLOW Quadrant offers a framework for thinking about one's source of income and path to financial freedom. The author advocates transitioning from the left side as an employee or self-employed to the right as a business owner or investor. The story of Bill and Ed shows that it is better to build pipelines through leveraged business systems and investments rather than haul buckets through hard work alone. This book aims to help readers make that important mindset transition.

 Here is a summary:

The book is divided into three parts:

1. The first part focuses on the differences between the four quadrants of the CASHFLOW Quadrant. It helps you identify your current quadrant and where you want to be in 5 years. 

2. The second part is about personal change and developing the mindset of a B or I. 

3. The third part explains how to find success as a B or I. It shares secrets for developing the skills to become a successful B or I.

The key messages are:

•Developing financial intelligence is critical to moving from E and S to B and I. It would help if you controlled the direction of your cash flow.

•The book is for those ready to go beyond job security and build their own "pipelines" to achieve financial freedom. 

•There are more opportunities in the Information Age, and B's and I can identify and seize them. Success requires information from all quadrants, though schools still focus on E and S.

•The book provides insights for moving from E and S to B and I based on the author's personal journey in doing so.

The summary outlines the structure and core messages in the book about transitioning from Employee/Self-Employed to Business Owner/Investor by developing financial intelligence and the proper mindset. The book aims to provide the insights and secrets to make this transition based on the author's experience.
