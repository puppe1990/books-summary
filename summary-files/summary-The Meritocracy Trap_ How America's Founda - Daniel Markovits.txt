 Here is a summary:

Uber, founded in 2009, is a ride-sharing service that utilizes a mobile app to connect passengers with drivers. As of 2018, Uber was valued at over $50 billion. Uber considers its drivers to be independent contractors rather than employees. 

Over the past few decades, large companies have moved away from direct managerial control of employees. Middle management positions have declined. Instead, companies increasingly rely on technology and metrics to monitor performance. For example, companies use supply chain management software and metrics like “Six Sigma” to tightly control inventory and quality.

Before the mid-1980s, large companies rarely laid off workers. Now mass layoffs are common, even when companies are profitable. Companies have moved away from “no layoff” policies and job security. Managerial positions have declined the most. The ratio of managers to workers declined from 1:5 to 1:30 between the 1950s to the 1980s. Since 1987, the number of middle managers has declined by about 25%.

Companies increasingly rely on temporary, part-time, and contract workers rather than permanent employees. About 30-40% of the workforce in advanced economies have “non-standard” work arrangements. Companies can hire and fire these workers more easily. Although temporary workers are often paid less, the lower costs are offset by fees charged by the staffing agencies that provide temporary workers. The key benefit for companies is greater flexibility.

Some companies like Uber and Amazon even have “no employees at all.” They rely entirely on contractors and the employees of subcontractors and staffing agencies. For example, Amazon utilizes over 25,000 warehouse workers employed by temporary staffing agencies. Companies claim these workers are not their employees, even though they control many aspects of their work.

In summary, over the past few decades, large companies have moved away from direct managerial control of permanent employees. They have replaced middle managers and job security with technology and metrics for monitoring performance. An increasing share of the workforce has temporary, part-time, and contract work rather than permanent jobs. Some companies have even eliminated direct employees altogether, relying entirely on contractors and subcontractors.   

- Among large employers, there is increasing concentration of market power that allows companies to depress wages. This trend, combined with globalization and outsourcing, has contributed to a declining labor share of national income in recent decades. 

- Eight of the ten richest Americans today are self-made, and nearly seven in ten of the Forbes 400 richest Americans are self-made entrepreneurs, not inheritors of wealth. Self-made wealth has been increasing over time. 

- The share of wealth from finance increased from 22% in 1961 to 47% in 1992 to 34% in 2007. Nearly a quarter of the Forbes 400 richest Americans work in finance. Top hedge fund managers make an average of $2.4 million per year. Salaries and bonuses for those in the finance industry, especially in New York City, are disproportionately high. The financial sector’s representation in the top tiers of wealth has increased tenfold since the 1970s.

- CEO compensation has also skyrocketed. The highest-paid CEOs now make over $100 million per year, while the 200th highest-paid CEOs still make over $10 million. CEO pay has increased much faster than corporate profits or stock prices. 

- There is a perception that highly skilled “talent” has the upper hand in the labor market and is able to demand higher and higher pay. However, the increasing inequality seems to be driven more by increasing concentration of wealth and market power at the top than by differences in human capital or skills. Market power and concentration seem to be more important forces behind inequality than talent alone. 

- Income and economic security are rising for high-income households but declining for middle-income households. Middle-income households face more frequent and larger drops in income. 

- The probability of experiencing a 50% or greater drop in income has doubled since 1970. Income volatility and instability have increased.

- Income insecurity and volatility harm children’s development and health. They are linked to worse cognitive, mental health, and physical health outcomes in children. Children exposed to income shocks in utero or early childhood suffer worst.

- Income instability disproportionately affects lower-income and less-educated families. Their children tend to experience worse developmental outcomes.

- Higher-income, college-educated parents have increased their investments in their children much more than lower-income, less-educated parents. They spend more time on developmental childcare and education.

- Many high-achieving, college-educated women drop out of the workforce or scale back their careers to care for their children. This is less common for less-educated women.

- There is a “class gap” in parenting styles and child-rearing. Higher-income, college-educated parents engage in “concerted cultivation”—deliberately stimulating their children’s development. Lower-income, less-educated parents are more likely to provide basic necessities but less likely to cultivate their children's development and leisure activities. 

- For example, higher-income, college-educated parents are much more likely to read to their children, do educational activities with them, and be involved in their schools. Less-educated, lower-income parents face more barriers to that kind of intensive parenting. 

- The German government provides free daycare and caps daycare fees at 90 euros to promote egalitarian education. 
- On the other hand, U.S. and German employers have invested in different labor segments. U.S. firms invest more in high-skilled workers, increasing wages and wage gaps. German firms invest in mid-skilled workers, decreasing wage gaps. 
- Investment in equipment increases wages for workers who use that equipment. U.S. investment in manufacturing and retail increased the skill premium, while German investment decreased it. U.S. investment in banking increased inequality, while German investment decreased it.
- Across developed countries, wage premiums and investments in elite vs. middle-class education rise and fall together. Where education concentrates in the elite, firms invest in the elite, increasing wage gaps. Where education is more dispersed, firms invest in mid-skilled workers, decreasing wage gaps.
- A meritocratic elite stimulates demand for its own skills through a "skill fetish." The elite spends heavily on education, and its skills drive more skill-biased innovation. This cycle continues, in a feedback loop. 
- There are two ways society can be unequal: unequal access to opportunity and unequal outcomes across classes. Meritocracy can fail at both, blocking the middle class from elite opportunities and increasing the gap between social classes.
- Feedback loops connect these failures. Mechanisms that increase inequality also make access to opportunity unequal, and vice versa. Together, they have reduced absolute social mobility, especially for the middle class. 
- These effects create a caste system. Elites close ranks through exclusive education and skill bias. Their individual actions accumulate in ways that collectively harm society. 
- Rather than elites pulling the ladder up behind them, deep social and economic forces drive inequality. Individual choices—to educate children, work hard, innovate—feed on themselves in harmful ways. Focusing on individual actions obscures these deeper structures.
- This process resembles the "resource curse," where countries rich in resources like oil often develop less. Here, the cursed resource is human capital. Exceptional elite skills distort the economy, concentrating wealth and power in a narrow class. The economy fails to educate the masses or develop a strong middle class. Institutions protect elite interests over the public good. Economic growth slows down. 

• Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, aims to make Amazon “the earth’s most customer-centric company.” Amazon’s development of efficient customer service and delivery models has enabled its success.

• Amazon adopted lean management principles from Toyota to optimize its operations. It focuses on eliminating waste and inefficiency, continual improvement, and meeting customer needs. Amazon has streamlined its operations, supply chain, and delivery. 

• Amazon relies heavily on automation and AI. In some warehouses, there are only a few human workers. Amazon acquired Kiva Systems, a robotics company, to further automate its warehouses. The difference between Amazon’s automation and previous waves is one of kind rather than degree.

• There has been a flattening of corporate hierarchies. CEOs have smaller executive teams reporting directly to them. Executive teams have become larger. Some CEOs, like McDonald’s CEO, have more equivalent educational backgrounds to their subordinates.

• Management consulting has grown rapidly. Elite consulting firms like McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group have double-digit revenue growth and employ tens of thousands. They cater to elite, highly educated consultants. Consulting provides advice and solutions that were once developed internally.

• CEO pay has skyrocketed in recent decades. The average CEO of a large US firm makes over 300 times the median worker’s pay. CEO pay growth has far outstripped company stock and economic growth. The highest-paid CEOs make nearly 10% of the entire profits of the S&P 1500. 

• Although managerial ranks have thinned, managerial pay and status have climbed. Managers have taken over more jobs and account for a larger share of private sector employment. Managerial jobs are seen as higher status. Tasks and skills, not job titles, increasingly determine status and pay.

• Large retail chains have dominated single-store retailers. In 1967, single-store firms made up 70% of retail sales; today, massive chains do. Chains can provide more long-term career paths and training than single-store firms. Retail work is increasingly concentrated in large chains.

In summary, massive corporations, automation and AI, the growing power and status of managers and executives, the rise of elite consulting, and the decline of single-store businesses in favor of large chains are leading to a more concentrated, inequitable business landscape and workforce. Highly educated elites reap the greatest rewards in this system. 

- According to surveys of University of Michigan law school graduates, those over age 50 averaged over 50 hours of work per week, while over a quarter averaged over 60 hours. Sources from the legal profession confirm long work hours to be common, with some lawyers describing work weeks of 80-100 hours or more. 

- While long work hours are prevalent in some prestigious professions like law, this is not the norm for most occupations. However, working hours have been increasing in general. According to analyses of U.S. Census data, the percentage of Americans working more than 48 hours per week rose from 15.4% in 1980 to 23.3% in 2005. The percentage working more than 60 hours per week rose from 12.5% to 18.3% over the same period.

- The increase in working hours is not evenly distributed across the population. Higher-income, more educated workers have seen bigger increases in hours. Whereas less than 10% of workers in the bottom wage quintile worked more than 48 hours per week in 1980, nearly 17% did in 2005. For those in the top quintile, the percentage rose from 22.6% to 30.4%. 

- The increased hours for higher-income workers have come at the expense of leisure time. Analyses of time-use data show that between 1965 and 2003, annual hours of leisure declined by about 5-6 hours per week for men with college degrees, while increasing by 6-8 hours for men without high school diplomas. For women, leisure hours declined slightly for those with college degrees but increased by over 4 hours per week for less educated women.

- In summary, while new technologies and efficiencies have reduced work hours for some, this has disproportionately benefitted less advantaged groups. For higher-income, professional workers, increasing demands for high pay and job security have led to longer working hours and less leisure time. The result has been a widening “time divide” in American society. 

Economic factors now determine the characteristics of places more than individual personalities. Overbrook Street has followed the same path as Palo Alto, becoming an affluent neighborhood. 

The lives of Bill Clinton’s daughter Chelsea and George Bush’s daughters Barbara and Jenna have been shaped by their elite status, unlike their parents’ generation. They attended prestigious schools and work high-paying jobs. None have lived middle-class lives. They exemplify today’s elite.

Meritocratic inequality impacts the rich and others in all areas of life. The elite and others live, work, marry, raise children, worship, and socialize differently, separating their inner and outer lives. Less educated Americans are less trusting and civic-minded and more pessimistic. Class migrants who join the elite face difficulties assimilating. Universities aim to help lower-income students but also promote the meritocratic system.  

The metaphor of “changing sides” captures how the classes are separated without shared experiences. Data on health and longevity also show the divide. The elite report better health and live longer. They receive different healthcare. They spend heavily on cosmetic dentistry while others lack basic dental care. The gap in life expectancy between the top and bottom has grown substantially. Even within the elite, the very rich outlive the rich. The geographic divide reflects these trends.

In summary, economics now shapes places. Chelsea Clinton and Barbara/Jenna Bush typify today’s elite. Meritocracy creates a vast divide in all areas of life for the elite and others. Metaphors of “changing sides” and data on health/longevity show the separation and inequality. The very rich even outlive the rich. Place reflects status. 

- Midcentury finance and management were strikingly democratic, with jobs and rewards widely shared. 
- New technologies transformed these sectors, concentrating jobs and rewards in a narrow elite.
- Finance and management now focus on complex, analytic tasks that require high skills.  Less skilled, middle-class workers have declined.
- In finance, the share of clerks and admin staff has fallen from 60% to 30% of hours since 1970, while managers and professionals rose from 25% to 45%. The education gap grew seven-fold.
- The fastest growth has been in elite roles like computers/math specialists (up six-fold) and securities traders (up thirty-fold). Elite firms target top schools and pay the highest salaries. 
- Finance pay has skyrocketed, with top hedge fund managers earning billions. Finance growth feeds on skills and productivity, not adding workers.
- Management was virtually nonexistent in the 1800s due to short job tenures, simple goods/services, and limited tech. Firms used contractors, not employees.
- From 1850 to 1950, tech changes enabled management. Complex goods and mass production demanded coordination. Innovations in tech, organization, and training supplied it.
- Middle managers and lifetime employees were loyal and tailored to firms. Unions also coordinated, with leaders acting as middle managers and workers developing firm-specific skills.  
- This led to hierarchical, managed firms with all employees, from production to CEO, on a managerial continuum. But this has since polarized.

So in short, new technologies initially spread management and finance jobs/pay broadly but ultimately polarized them, concentrating complex, highly paid work at the top and pushing less skilled labor to the margins. 

• Social norms around work and leisure have changed dramatically. The old elite culture of leisure has been replaced by a new elite culture of intense work and long hours. This is evident in surveys showing that elite workers, like law students, expect and accept extremely long work hours. 

• Elite workers now openly boast about and complain of their long work hours. It has become a badge of honor and a symbol of excellence, commitment, and dynamism. In contrast, idleness and leisure are now disdained. 

• This norm of intense work is used to justify enormous salaries for elite jobs. Elite workers argue their long hours warrant high pay, while employers argue high pay justifies demanding long hours. This reciprocal logic helps reconcile the inequality and exploitation.

• The elite’s valorization of work and disdain of leisure represents a reversal of the social order that has prevailed for centuries. Leisure and idleness were once symbols of high status, while labor was for the subordinate class. The elite have adopted the habits and morality of the striving middle and working classes. 

• Economic inequality today primarily concerns the gap between the rich and the middle class (high-end inequality), rather than the gap between the middle class and the poor (low-end inequality). For most of history, inequality and injustice centered on poverty. But in mid-20th-century America, policies created the modern middle class and reduced high-end inequality, even as poverty persisted.

• Michael Harrington’s 1962 book The Other America highlighted the poverty that endured despite the mid-century boom and growth of the middle class. His book described the deprivation and misery of the poor, who were left out of the broader prosperity and treated as “internal exiles.” 

- The American middle class has declined in size and wealth in recent decades. The share of households classified as middle class has fallen from 61 to 50 percent, and their share of income has fallen from 62 to 43 percent. Most Americans are no longer middle class.  

- Economic inequality in the U.S. has increased. The gap between the rich and the rest has widened. The U.S. middle class is no longer the richest in the world.  

- Cultural differences between social classes have also increased. The working class values solidarity, while the upper class values individual achievement. The rich scorn some working-class values.

- Job opportunities have polarized. Mid-level jobs have declined, while high-skill, high-wage jobs and low-skill, low-wage jobs have expanded. Getting a good job increasingly requires a college degree. The job application process has become more intensive, with tests and long interviews.

- Residential and social segregation by class has increased. The affluent live in separate neighborhoods and have their own social circles. They even face different risks of violence.

- Family life has changed differently by class. Divorce and nonmarital childbearing have declined among the college educated but not those with less education. Access to contraception and abortion also differs by class.

- Civic engagement and social trust have declined more among the less educated. The college-educated remain politically and civically active, while others have disengaged. 

- Economic and social gender inequalities remain substantial but differ in degree across classes. Women remain underrepresented in leadership roles, especially in high-paying fields like finance. But gender inequities tend to be greater among less affluent groups.

In sum, the U.S. class system has become more polarized, unequal, and riven by cultural gaps. Economic, social, and family changes have benefited the affluent while disadvantaging those with less education.  The lives of the college educated increasingly differ from those of Americans without a degree. 

- Poverty and deprivation in the U.S. have declined substantially since the mid-20th century. Most Americans now have their basic needs met.

- At the same time, inequality at the top end of the income distribution has increased dramatically. The incomes of the top 1% have more than doubled relative to the median income. The gap between the rich and the middle class has widened. 

- Two trends illustrate this: 1) Inequality has decreased slightly for the bottom 70% of the income distribution. But inequality has skyrocketed for the top 5%. The gap between the very rich and the merely rich has grown huge. 2) Overall inequality, as measured by the Gini index, has increased sharply, showing the growing gap between the rich and everyone else.

- This rise in high-end inequality changes the nature of the problem. In the mid-20th century, the central issue was poverty. Now the central issue is the gap between the super-rich and the rest of the population. Low-end inequality has declined, but high-end inequality has swamped it.

- The rise of the “working rich” or “meritocrats” makes inequality harder to address. These high-earners seem to deserve their high pay because they have earned it through skill and hard work. It is harder to argue that they don’t deserve their advantages. And the middle class does not elicit the same sympathy as the poor. So arguments for redistribution are weakened.

- Despite rising inequality and concentration of wealth, government redistribution has declined. Tax rates on the wealthy have fallen. The middle class, not the poor, have lost the most from these trends. They have seen their income share fall and tax burdens rise. 

- This challenges the assumption that democracies will redistribute wealth from elites to the masses. In fact, as elites have gained more income and wealth, government policies have favored them. The middle class has suffered the consequences.

So in summary, while poverty has declined, high-end inequality has increased and made the overall distribution of income much more unequal. The rise of the meritocrats and concentration of wealth in elites have made this harder to address, even in a democracy. The middle class has been caught in the middle. 

An experimental study found that children from low-income families who were given vouchers to move to lower-poverty areas before age 13 had 31% higher incomes in their 20s than children in a control group. Their location during childhood had a lasting impact. 

Children of elite families are poised to lead elite lives. Chelsea Clinton, for example, attended Stanford, Columbia and Oxford Universities, married the son of a former congressman who founded his own hedge fund, and lives in an expensive Manhattan apartment. Her experiences are not exceptional but rather illustrate how the elite protect and prepare their children.

Upper-class children in the U.S. and other advanced economies have substantial advantages over middle-class and poor children. They are less pessimistic about technology's impact, more likely to believe that people control their own outcomes, and more likely to feel they can overcome obstacles. Their families and schools also know how to support them in accessing elite higher education. 

At elite colleges, low-income students can feel like outsiders and face threats to their persistence. Colleges are trying to help with mentoring and peer support programs. But there are tensions between goals like “sponsored mobility” (boosting a few low-income students), “contest mobility” (typical merit-based admissions), and “structural mobility” (disrupting the system).

Advantages accumulate over lifetimes and generations. As one professor from a working-class background said, “I feel like I have changed sides.” The gap between the middle-class and poor in health, income, wealth and life expectancy are all growing. The rich live nearly six years longer on average. Inequality is a “snowball” that gathers momentum over time.

Rising inequality threatens demand in a consumer economy as the rich cannot spend enough to sustain growth. Government intervention is needed to rebalance demand. But policies to spread wealth more evenly are strongly opposed. There are no easy answers, but rising inequality should concern us all given its self-perpetuating and corrosive impacts. 

- In the mid-20th century, income inequality declined in the US as the middle class grew and prospered across the country. The wealthy elite spread out geographically and integrated with the middle class. 

- Today, inequality is rising again due to a new meritocratic elite. This elite concentrates in a few prosperous cities and separates itself from the rest of society.

- The new elite is highly educated and works in knowledge-intensive jobs that cluster together in cities. They require elite schools and amenities that are only available in prosperous cities. This draws the elite to geographic concentration. 

- The elite is moving into cities, while the middle class stays in rural and suburban areas. Cities are becoming more stratified by education and income. The most educated and prosperous cities have seen much greater increases in incomes and costs of living. 

- Even within cities, residential segregation by income and education is increasing. The wealthy live in exclusive neighborhoods with other wealthy, educated people. The poor are also more concentrated. Mixed-income neighborhoods are declining.

- The neighborhoods the elite live in provide substantial advantages, including better health, education, safety, and stability. This amplifies inequality. Children in these neighborhoods have huge advantages in accessing elite higher education and high-paying jobs. 

- Overall, people today move to be around others like themselves, unlike in the mid-20th century. Towns and cities have become more identified with a particular income or class level. Geographic inequality and lack of mobility are self-perpetuating.

In summary, a new meritocratic elite is geographically isolating itself in exclusive neighborhoods within prosperous cities, separating themselves and their children from the rest of society and amplifying inequality across generations. In contrast, the mid-20th century saw more geographic and social integration between classes. 

- Economic inequality was low in mid-20th century America. The wealthy lived modestly and mingled with the middle class. There was little distinction in lifestyle, culture or lived experience between the rich and middle class. 

- Today, economic inequality has increased substantially. The middle class is shrinking while the wealthy have become extremely affluent. There is now a vast gulf in lifestyle, culture and lived experience between the elite upper class and the rest of society.

- Work: There is now a huge gap between the overwork of the elite and the underemployment of the rest. The elite valorize long work hours while disparaging the idle. Workplaces are also now highly segregated by skill and education. Getting a job now requires a competitive application process. In contrast, mid-century workplaces were highly integrated, hiring was casual, and skills were modest.

- Homes and neighborhoods are now deeply segregated by class. The wealthy live in separate, elite enclaves while excluding the rest. In contrast, mid-century neighborhoods were mixed and integrated across class. 

- Consumption: The wealthy now engage in elite consumption of high-end, artisanal and eco-friendly goods. They look down on middle-class mass consumption. In contrast, mid-century consumption was largely homogenous across class.

- Culture: The elite now have their own exclusive culture with little overlap with mainstream culture. They define their elite status through conspicuous cultural consumption and distinction. In contrast, mid-century culture was shared broadly across class.

- Education: Elite education is now a key mechanism of upper-class reproduction, and it segregates the elite from the rest of society. In contrast, mid-century education exhibited little class distinction. 

- Intermarriage: The elite now predominantly marry and reproduce within their own class. In contrast, mid-century marriage and reproduction occurred across class lines. 

In sum, mid-century America exhibited a blurring of class lines and shared solidarity across the population. Today, class divisions have hardened into a rigid caste system that comprehensively separates elite and middle-class lifestyles, values and experiences. Inequality now threatens to divide America against itself. Here is a summary of the key points about income and work hours:

• Since the 1980s, economic gains have disproportionately accrued to the top 1% of income earners. The top 1% saw their incomes grow much faster than the rest of the population. 

• Long work hours are often used as a proxy for productivity and status. There is pressure for high-income, high-status jobs to work extremely long hours as a signal of dedication and worthiness.

• There is evidence that income inequality within industries and firms leads to longer work hours, as people compete for status and higher pay through conspicuous displays of overwork. 

• Extremely long work hours are common in high-paying fields like finance, law, and technology. Workers frequently miss important life events and struggle to balance work and family. 

• Firms have started offering perks like paid sabbaticals to counteract burnout from overwork. But there is still stigma around taking too much time off.

• Although higher incomes are correlated with longer work hours, studies show that beyond a certain point, additional income and consumption do not increase well-being or happiness. Long work hours may even decrease satisfaction and work-life balance.

• For high-income earners, much of the gains from additional income are offset by spending on zero-sum status goods and competition. Overall standards of living do not always rise proportionally with income. 

• Surveys show that many high-income, high-status workers would prefer to work less extreme hours, even for less pay. But the culture of overwork and the rat race for ever-higher incomes and status prevents this. 

- The incomes of the very rich today come predominantly from labor, not capital. About half of the largest American fortunes come from founders’ stock in companies the founders built. Carried interest and stock options also provide a large share of income for hedge fund managers and CEOs. Pensions and housing provide another third of top incomes.

- Two-thirds to three-quarters of the income of the top 1% and top 0.1% comes from their own effort and skill, not from land, machines, or finance. Only about a quarter of the increase in the income share of the top 1% over the past half century comes from capital gains. The rest comes from increased labor income, especially at the top.

- The view that inequality has risen because labor’s share of income has declined in favor of capital is too simplistic. Labor’s share has only declined slightly. The real story is a shift in labor income toward the very top. The top 1% and 0.1% are gaining primarily from high salaries and business income, not from capital gains. 

- This rise in elite labor income has transformed class dynamics. The traditional conflict between capital and labor does not capture what is happening. The real conflict is now within the labor market, between elite labor at the top and middle-class labor. The elite are winning through meritocratic means.

- The attitudes and culture of the new elite reflect this transformation. People like Mark Zuckerberg work hard and value ambition, skill, and achievement. Zuckerberg giving away most of his fortune promotes this culture and helps ensure his daughter can achieve elite status through her own work and skill. This attitude would have been bizarre to the old aristocratic elite, for whom leisure and inheritance were marks of status. But for the new meritocratic elite, it makes sense.

- In summary, the rise of the working rich and the shift to meritocratic inequality have fundamentally reshaped class dynamics and culture. The conflict between elite and middle-class labor is now central. And the elite embrace and promote an ethos of hard work, ambition, and achievement. Here is a summary of the key points:

- In the 19th century, lawyers worked moderate hours, around 1400-1600 per year for associates and 1200-1400 for partners. This view persisted into the mid-20th century. 

- By the 1980s and 1990s, average billable hours for lawyers rose dramatically. Surveys report averages of 1500-2000 hours for associates and partners. Some report associates billing over 2400 hours during busy periods. 

- The rise of billable hours was linked to broader trends like increasing competition, restructuring of firms, and the influence of business logic. Firms sought to maximize profits by increasing leverage and encouraging long hours.

- The rise of billable hours reflected a broader trend of increasing work hours, especially for high-status, high-earning jobs. Surveys show increasing hours for executives, managers, bankers, tech workers, and others. Some report "extreme jobs" with 60-80 hour weeks.

- The pressures of long hours and constant availability are often seen as necessary to career success in highly competitive fields. But they also often lead to poor work-life balance, health issues, high turnover, and other problems. 

- Firms that demand very long hours are often characterized as having a "culture of overwork." They use demanding expectations and continual performance monitoring to enforce a norm of constant availability and long hours. 

- The rise of billable hours transformed the legal profession. Lawyers came to be seen less as professionals and more as profit-maximizing service providers. There were concerns this would undermine professionalism and independence.

- Legislators and bar associations considered intervening to curb the rise of billable hours but ultimately did not take strong action. The logic of the market and competition were seen as too powerful.

So in summary, the rise of billable hours was part of a broader trend toward overwork in highly competitive professions and was enabled by a culture that equated long hours with merit, success, and organizational demands. It significantly transformed the legal profession by subjecting it to a much more commercial logic. 

- In 1970, college-educated workers were evenly distributed geographically and across jobs. Today, there is much more sorting by skill level. 

- Firms intensely screen job candidates and then separate skilled and unskilled workers. Only low-wage firms hire casually. Elite firms recruit from select colleges and conduct lengthy interviews. This screening and sorting has become more precise over time.

- Screening enables firms to segregate skilled and unskilled workers. Firms have incentives to segregate so they can optimize production. This has led to extreme skill segregation. 

- Middle management has declined, separating managers and workers. Skilled and unskilled workers are in separate firms and industries. Retail and finance used to employ both but now represent low- and high-skilled work, respectively. Social mobility across firms is unlikely.

- The separation of middle-class and elite workers has led to distinct work cultures. Elite jobs are alienating but framed collaboratively. Work and life blur. Responsibility and initiative are prized. Non-elite work is subordinate and controlling. Uniforms, strict rules, and micromanagement are common. Workers are treated as tools.

- At the extremes, elite jobs consume lives but provide status, while millions are excluded from work and status, especially minorities. For the latter, enforced idleness sustains racial subordination.

- Today’s elite families are stable and devoted to child-rearing for human capital. Elite men prefer educated, successful wives, unlike the “ornamental wives” that signaled status previously. Families are now sites of production rather than consumption.

In summary, radical changes in the workforce have separated skilled and unskilled labor into distinct tribes with separate work cultures and lifestyles. For elites, work and family fuel an anxious quest for status and human capital. For others, they sustain a caste order of enforced idleness and deprivation. 

The middle class in America is struggling to sustain itself as the economy changes. The middle class built postwar America, but now faces stagnant wages, job insecurity, and social decline. Meritocracy, which was supposed to promote opportunity, has instead caused harm.  

Meritocracy has inflicted economic and psychic wounds on the middle class. It has made middle-class jobs and workers redundant while demanding that people constantly prove their worth. This has led to stagnant wages, broken families, poor health, and “deaths of despair.” Mortality rates are rising for middle-aged whites due to suicides, overdoses, and alcoholism.  

Meritocracy also harms the elite. Elite children face constant pressure to achieve and build their resumes. As adults, the elite work long hours in intensely competitive jobs. They report wanting more leisure time and work-life balance. Meritocracy turns all of life into a contest, from getting into preschool all the way to making partner at a law firm or bank. This "epidemic of effort" leaves little room for rest or relationships.  

In summary, meritocracy was supposed to promote opportunity and fair competition. But in reality, it has trapped the middle class in stagnation and decline while subjecting the elite to relentless effort and anxiety. Overall, it has inflicted significant harms on American society. A new system is needed to reverse these damaging effects. Here is a summary of the sources:

therefore from richer families: Such employer-provided training as endures in the American economy is skewing further and further in favor of elite workers. In 1983, college graduates were roughly three times as likely to receive workplace training as workers without high school degrees.

equal or even exceed the direct costs: Elite professional school students overwhelmingly possess elite BAs (the professional schools select for this criterion, after all) and so enjoy the employment opportunities that this credential provides. When  they go back to school, professional students forswear immediate income. This indirect cost should not be treated as an investment in professional students’ human capital (that would be double counting). But it nevertheless contributes to the concentration of human capital in the rich, by causing professional schools to  select directly for students who possess sufficient family wealth to be able to afford the delay to their own income that professional  school involves.

more rapidly even than income inequality: Consumption here is measured and classified by the categories in the Consumer Expenditure Survey.

The passage describes how the nature of economic inequality and the elite has changed over time. In the past, the elite were idle rich who did not work and exploited the labor of the poor and middle class. Now, the elite work extremely hard in demanding jobs and owe most of their high incomes to their labor. Poverty used to be widespread but is now less severe, even as economic inequality has increased. Inequality used to focus on the poverty of the poor but now focuses on the wealth and privilege of the elite. 

The old arguments against inequality and aristocracy do not apply to the new meritocratic elite. The elite now work harder than ever, inoculating themselves against charges of unearned advantage or exploitation. And with less poverty, arguments for redistribution to help the poor are less compelling. Meritocracy was supposed to reduce inequality but instead has become its source.

The rise of the meritocratic elite is without historical precedent. The old tools for understanding inequality and arguments against it no longer apply. Champions of equality must now argue for redistributing from the hardworking elite to the less hardworking middle class, a difficult argument to make.

The sociologist Thorstein Veblen described how leisure used to be a marker of high status. The upper classes avoided work and industry. But the modern elite embrace hard work and long hours. The nature of both inequality and the elite has fundamentally changed. Understanding this new meritocratic inequality requires understanding the working rich, who they are and how they earn their high incomes. 

- Elite graduate and professional education has shifted over the last few generations from workplace-based training programs to university-based degree programs. This has had significant consequences for how investments in "human capital" are distributed in society.

- Post-college education has long represented major investments in workers, especially elite workers. Mid-century employers invested heavily in training elite workers. Now, elite graduate and professional schools make even larger investments in students - over $350,000 per Harvard Business School student per year. 

- Shifting to university-based training skews these investments dramatically toward wealthier students. University admissions and costs strongly favor wealthier applicants. Elite schools are extremely competitive and draw almost entirely from other elite colleges, which are also dominated by wealthier students. Direct and indirect costs of elite degrees often exceed $100,000 per year.

- This results in elite graduate and professional schools having an "almost inconceivable" imbalance toward students from wealthy families. Surveys show over 60-90% of students at top schools come from the top income percentiles. Workplace training once promoted social mobility, but now elite education concentrates opportunity and investment among an "almost unimaginably exclusive" socioeconomic elite.

- The education and training received by this elite class differences from ordinary education in almost every way. It prepares wealthy children for elite "superordinate" jobs in a distinctive culture and lifestyle. The gap between elite and ordinary education can be measured by estimating the greater investments in human capital for a typical wealthy child versus a middle-class child - likely $10,000-$15,000 per year more for preschool, $20,000-$25,000 more for elementary school, $50,000-$60,000 more for high school, and $90,000 more for college.

- Compared to the old leisure class, today's elite owe their status to labor and human capital, not physical or financial capital. So elite parents today invest far more in educating their children than the old elite did, to pass on opportunity through merit and achievement rather than inheritance. The new elite's greater investments in education reflect the source of their status and privilege. Here's a summary:

- Wealthy, educated parents invest heavily in their children's human capital through education and extracurricular activities. This gap in investment between rich and poor families has tripled in recent decades.

- Families at the very top of the income distribution spend exorbitant amounts, up to $100,000 per child, on things like music lessons, tutoring, and camps. These investments pay off through better outcomes. 

- The achievement gap between rich and poor students is now greater than the white-black achievement gap. The rich-middle class achievement gap has also grown and now exceeds the middle class-poor gap.

- On the SAT, students from the richest and most educated families score hundreds of points higher than students from poorer and less educated families. The rich-middle class gap is now greater than the middle class-poor gap.

- Elite high schools send nearly all their students to college, with top private schools sending large portions to top colleges. The investments of rich families lead to admission to elite higher education.

- Admissions to elite colleges, especially Ivy League schools, has become much more competitive over time, while admissions at most other schools has remained steady or eased. Competition centers around elite high schools and families.

- In summary, wealthy families are able to heavily invest in their children's education and gain admission to elite institutions, perpetuating advantage. Inequality in education and outcomes has increased between social classes, especially at the top. Merit and achievement are highly tied to family resources and social class. 

- There are significant differences in consumption between the rich and the middle class today. Consumption makes up a large part of the economy and reflects the values of society. 

- Historically, elites consumed very different goods than the masses. This began to change in the early 20th century and mid-century capitalism led to the middle class gaining access to many of the same consumer goods as the rich, like homes, cars, and appliances. Tastes and values aligned with this trend.

- Today, consumption has again become segregated. The middle class consumes “thrift goods” from stores like Walmart and Dollar General and relies on “thrift finance” like payday loans and credit cards to fund their consumption. The rich consume luxury goods that affirm their status. 

- The middle class has had declining savings rates and rising debt levels since the 1970s. They use debt to finance necessary expenses that their wages do not cover. This debt leaves them vulnerable to crises like foreclosures and bankruptcies. Some refer to the precarious middle class as the “precariat.”

- The values of the meritocratic elite have shifted to prize conspicuous consumption and lavish luxury goods. This displays their status and success. Luxury brands and goods embody the elite’s self-image and virtue in a meritocracy. Ordinary or adequate goods are looked down upon.

- In summary, consumption has become another way that inequality manifests in society. The middle class struggles with debt to afford basic goods while the elite conspicuously signal their success through lavish luxury consumption. This reflects the logic of meritocracy and the alienation of the elite class. 

- Beyoncé’s Formation World Tour in 2016 featured some of the most expensive tickets in recent history, with many tickets costing over $200. Tickets for other luxury events like Lakers games, Cowboys games, and Yankees games can also be very pricey.

- For high-end consumers, tickets and experiences are becoming more exclusive and separate from those available to ordinary people. These "velvet rope economies" offer elite access and perks not available to most, even using loyalty programs. 

- Commercial air travel illustrates this trend. Regular flyers are packed in while those in first class experience luxury. The gap between the haves and have-nots is widening.

- Parallel luxury-tier systems are emerging in industries like healthcare. Concierge doctors provide attentive care and exclusive perks to the wealthy. This shift could deprive millions of patients of access to doctors. The concierge model is growing quickly.

- Significant differences in dining, retail, housing, and community are segregating the wealthy from others. The affluent have access to the highest-quality, most artisanal and exclusive goods and services, from designer clothing to premium salts, while most make do with mass-market, homogeneous offerings. 

- There is also increasing economic segregation geographically, with wealth concentrating in certain cities and neighborhoods. From 1945 to 1979, incomes across U.S. cities converged, and a broad middle class formed. Since then, however, regional inequality has spiked. Wealth and opportunity are clustering in elite cities, while other cities struggle. Young college graduates are flocking to the most affluent cities, reinforcing this trend.

In summary, separate spheres of extreme privilege and opportunity are developing for the very wealthy that fundamentally set their experiences apart from those of ordinary people. This is happening across industries and geographies, accelerating the divergence of lives along class lines. 

The article examines the growing income inequality in the United States, specifically the increasing share of national income going to the top 1% of households. In 2010, the top 1% of households earned about 21% of all income, up from about 9% in 1980. The author attributes this trend to several factors:

1) The top 1% of households are disproportionately composed of dual-income households where both partners have high-paying, elite jobs. About 74% of households in the top income quintile have two or more earners, compared to only 5% in the bottom quintile. 

2) There has been an explosion of high-paying jobs, especially for elite professionals. There are over 1.5 million households in the top 1%, and many of these households have jobs like executives, managers, doctors, lawyers, and consultants that pay very high salaries. For example, there are over 240,000 vice presidents at S&P 1500 companies, over 630,000 registered financial representatives, and over 500,000 specialist physicians—and these are just a few elite professions.

3) The increasing power of financial capital and decline of labor unions have shifted more of the economic gains to the owners of capital. Stock market gains and high executive pay have contributed to increasing inequality. At the same time, the decline of labor unions has reduced wages for typical workers.

In summary, increasing inequality in the U.S. can be attributed to major social and economic changes that have disproportionately benefited high-income, high-skilled households with elite jobs. Unless policy changes are made, inequality is likely to continue rising. Here is a summary of the reading:

- There is unequal spending on education for wealthy and poor students, which contributes to the inefficiency of the U.S. education system. The U.S. spends more per student than most other developed nations but has average student achievement. 
- The test prep industry, which primarily benefits wealthy students, is a multibillion-dollar industry. Admission to top colleges and access to resources skew heavily toward the wealthy.
- Private tutoring for wealthy students can cost up to $100,000 per year for young children and over $1,000 per hour for high school students applying to college. Some tutors have become celebrities. The private tutoring industry generates over $100 billion in annual revenue globally. 
- Private schools for wealthy students generate billions in tuition. For example, Harvard University’s endowment is $5 billion. Wealthy, highly educated parents are more likely to invest in extracurriculars and private lessons for their children.
- Wealthy parents spend significantly more on their children’s education and activities. The gap in spending between high-income and low-income families has tripled since the 1970s. High-income parents spent nearly $7,500 more per year per child in 2008 dollars. Extracurricular activities like ballet or violin lessons can cost tens of thousands per year. 
- Rising consumption inequality in the U.S. since 1980 has been driven in large part by greater spending on education by high-income families. High-income families have increased their spending on education while middle- and low-income families have remained flat.
- Schools in wealthy areas tend to have greater resources, more experienced teachers, and higher-achieving students, which results in better outcomes. Housing costs are higher in areas with access to these schools.

In summary, there are huge inequities in access to education based on family wealth in the United States that start early and compound over time. Wealthy families can afford private schools, private lessons, private tutors, and enrichment activities that give their children significant advantages. They also have access to better-resourced schools and more experienced teachers by being able to afford housing in affluent areas. These inequities contribute to unequal outcomes and lack of social mobility. 

Part One of the book explores how meritocracy has brought both social release and discomfort. Meritocracy has provided opportunities for social mobility and improved lives. However, it has also led to vast inequality that harms both the middle class and the elite. 

Part Two details how meritocracy functions in society and the economy. It shows how meritocracy has led to unequal distribution of advantages like income, education, and jobs. This inequality arises directly from the successes of meritocracy, not from deviations from it. The workings of meritocracy have created the “meritocracy trap.”

Part Three exposes the falsehoods of meritocracy. Meritocracy claims to be fair and beneficial, promoting freedom and opportunity. But in reality, meritocracy has created a new form of aristocracy built around labor instead of land. Meritocratic inequality betrays the values meritocracy claims to uphold. Like the aristocracy of the past, meritocracy organizes society and is self-perpetuating through feedback loops. “Merit” itself is not real excellence but rather a pretense to justify unequal advantages.

Escaping the meritocracy trap would benefit society broadly. The middle class could regain dignity and prosperity. The elite could trade some wealth and status for more leisure and freedom. Society could heal from the oppression and mistrust created by meritocracy. However, escaping meritocracy requires political will and policy changes, which is challenging given the depth of meritocratic forces. Both the rich and the rest must recognize their shared interest in democratic renewal. They must overcome anxieties and antagonisms to form a coalition to ease each other’s burdens. If they fail to do so, meritocracy may collapse into something worse like oligarchy and populism. Overall, escaping the meritocracy trap is difficult but possible if society develops understanding and takes action. 

- Yale University opposes a proposed Connecticut tax bill as unconstitutional. The bill would tax the endowments of large nonprofits like Yale.

- The U.S. spends nearly 10% of GDP on health care, and Medicare and Medicaid make up a large portion of that spending. 

-The top 1% of earners pay about half of all income taxes.

- California passed a law allowing nurse practitioners rather than doctors to provide some primary care. Some routine legal services are also now provided by "legal technicians" rather than fully licensed attorneys.

- Federal regulations require cost-benefit analysis of new rules. However, it can be difficult to determine the costs and benefits.

- Payroll taxes like Social Security and Medicare taxes apply to only a portion of income, around $90,000. The rest of income is taxed at the lower income tax rates. This can result in a higher marginal tax rate for middle-income earners than for high-income earners. Income from capital gains and dividends are taxed at even lower rates.

- Raising or eliminating the Social Security payroll tax cap could increase tax revenue by over 1% of GDP. Eliminating the cap would make the Social Security tax system more progressive. 

- The marginal income tax rates on higher levels of income are about half as high as in the 1950s and 1960s. The top income tax rate has not exceeded 50% since 1982.

- A person earning $1 million pays an income tax rate only 8.6% higher than someone earning $90,000, but pays a 12.4% lower wage tax (Social Security and Medicare) rate due to the payroll tax cap. The marginal federal tax rate is higher for upper-middle-class labor income than for very high earners.

- The 2017 Republican tax reform helped reduce the relative overtaxation of middle-class labor income by providing more tax relief concentrated on middle-class wages. However, the reform was still regressive overall. 

- Discouraged workers and those who seek work but are not counted toward the unemployment rate live in separate worlds that rarely overlap. The least educated face difficulties finding work, while the most educated enjoy full employment. 

- Declining labor force participation rates have many causes, including aging population, gender norms, and economic cycles. However, the rates are falling even for prime-aged men and women, especially for less educated, lower-paid workers. In 2016, 78% of prime-aged men without college were employed, compared to 90% of those with at least some college. In the 1950s, the rates were the same.

- College graduates earn significantly more than high school graduates. A college degree provides higher lifetime earnings and a higher return on investment than the stock market. The college wage premium in the U.S. is larger than in other countries like Sweden. Returns are higher for degrees from selective schools. Degrees from the weakest schools provide little to no earnings boost.

- The trends of declining labor force participation, especially among the less educated, and increasing inequality based on education are expected to continue. The least educated face a “constant, demoralizing struggle to find work at all.” Meanwhile, contrary to the stereotype of underemployed college graduates, “the most educated enjoy full employment.”

In summary, there is a growing divide between the employment opportunities and lifetime earnings of more and less educated Americans. Those with college degrees, especially from prestigious schools, enjoy a substantial advantage, while those without higher education face considerable difficulties in the job market. 

- Postwar America had a relatively classless and economically equal society. The rich and middle class lived similar lives and consumed similar products. 

- This cultural and economic equality started breaking down as inequality rose again. The ratio of high-income to median incomes doubled. The lives of the rich and rest diverged in many ways - who they married, how they parented, how they spent leisure time, even what religions they practiced.

- Geographically, the rich and rest also separated. Affluent, educated communities pulled away from poorer, less-educated ones. College graduates and high-income individuals clustered in affluent cities and neighborhoods. 

- This growing divide between the affluent and the rest threatens social cohesion. The middle class feels insecure, the elite have incentives to entrench their position, and meritocracy itself is seen more as a barrier to mobility. The US increasingly comprises "two nations" with little "intercourse and no sympathy."

- While racial inequality persists, class inequality has also become a powerful force organizing American society. Gaps between rich and poor in areas like education, homeownership, and unemployment resemble past racial gaps. Even within racial groups, class predicts life outcomes. 

- In sum, rising economic inequality has shattered the social solidarity and shared interests Americans had at midcentury. Comprehensive inequality now poses a threat to American society that goes beyond the struggles of any one individual. Here is a summary of the key points:

- People are increasingly sorting themselves geographically by educational attainment and income. College graduates and high-income individuals are concentrating in certain affluent cities and neighborhoods. Less educated and lower-income individuals are concentrating in poorer cities and neighborhoods. 

- Between 2000 and 2014, the percentage of middle-class households declined in 203 of 229 major U.S. cities. The shares of lower-income and upper-income households increased in 160 and 172 cities, respectively. 

- In 1970, nearly two-thirds of families in the average U.S. city lived in middle-income neighborhoods. Today, only two-fifths do. The percentages of families in rich and poor neighborhoods have both doubled.

- Economic and educational segregation have increased substantially in recent decades. Measures of income segregation rose about 20-25% between 1970 and 1990. A dissimilarity index for education rose about 50% between 1970 and 2000. The geographic isolation of college graduates doubled between 1970 and 2000.

- In some affluent cities and neighborhoods, the percentage of college graduates approaches or exceeds 50%. In some of the most educated 5% of U.S. zip codes, over 75% of residents have a bachelor's degree or higher. Elite professional schools are also geographically concentrated.

- This “big sort” has significant consequences, including less economic opportunity and mobility for disadvantaged individuals, more political influence for affluent groups, greater inequality, and less social cohesion as people interact primarily with others like themselves. Broadly shared middle-class neighborhoods are declining.

- For further discussion of these issues, see The Big Sort by Bill Bishop; "Power Couples" by Costa and Kahn; various works by Murray, Moretti, and others. Here is a summary of the key points:

• In the mid-20th century, finance was seen as a boring and ordinary industry with limited job prospects. However, since then the financial sector has grown enormously and now offers many high-paying, elite jobs. Finance workers today earn much higher incomes than other workers. 

• The financial sector's share of the very highest earners in the U.S. has increased dramatically. About 20-25% of rising wage inequality can be attributed to the growth of high-paying finance jobs. At the same time, wages for lower-skilled finance workers have declined.

• The finance industry deployes a range of technologies and workers with various skill levels. Over the past 50 years, the industry has shifted to favor highly skilled, elite workers over mid-skilled workers. Many mid-skilled jobs have been eliminated and replaced by a small number of high-skilled, high-paying jobs and a larger number of low-skilled, low-paying jobs. This has led to a polarization of the labor market in finance.

• The home mortgage industry provides an example of how technological changes have transformed finance jobs. Mid-20th century home mortgages were issued by loan officers who used their judgment and discretion to evaluate borrowers and determine how much to lend. They were mid-skilled, middle-class workers. 

• Today, most home mortgages are securitized, bundled into mortgage-backed securities and sold to investors. This requires highly skilled workers to design, price, and trade these complex securities. At the same time, the job of the traditional loan officer has been largely deskilled. They now primarily gather information and fill out forms, exercising little judgment. They tend to be lower-skilled and lower-paid.

• Changes in finance technologies, including securitization, new contractual and legal frameworks, improved information technology systems, and elite labor practices have enabled and driven these shifts. While enhancing opportunities for highly skilled, high-paying jobs, these changes have reduced opportunities for mid-skilled workers like traditional loan officers.

• In summary, the finance industry has polarized into high-paying, high-skilled jobs and low-paying, low-skilled jobs, with a hollowing out of mid-skilled, middle-class work. Advancements in finance technologies have both enabled and motivated this labor market polarization. 

- There is evidence of labor market polarization in developed economies with employment growth concentrated in high-skill, high-wage jobs and low-skill, low-wage jobs at the expense of mid-skill, mid-wage jobs.

- Job losses during the Great Recession were concentrated in mid-wage occupations while job gains during the recovery were concentrated in low-wage and high-wage occupations. Low-wage jobs accounted for a disproportionate share of job losses but an even greater share of job gains. 

- There are predictions that in the future, nearly half of jobs will be either low-skill or high-skill, with automation eliminating many mid-skill jobs. The jobs most at risk of automation are routine and mid-skill while jobs least at risk are high-skill jobs requiring social skills and creativity. 

- The education and skills required for the high-skill and high-wage jobs of the future will be provided primarily through universities rather than through workplace training. The shift to university-based professional education suggests the labor market has become polarized with fewer mid-skill jobs and a wider gap between low-skill and high-skill jobs.

- The high and rising pay of high-skill, high-wage "superordinate" workers is due primarily to their increased productivity and economic value rather than unmeritocratic factors like nepotism, rent-seeking, or fraud. While those factors still play a role, structural changes in the economy have disproportionately rewarded skills and education. 

- There is evidence of declining social mobility and "opportunity hoarding" as the children of high-income, high-education parents are much more likely to achieve high levels of education and income themselves. Location and neighborhood also strongly predict one's ability to climb the income ladder.

- Labor market polarization has coincided with and reinforced the segmentation and stratification of workers by level of education. Workers with higher levels of education, especially advanced degrees, face much lower risks of unemployment. They are also more likely to participate in the labor force, as less educated workers have increasingly left the labor market.

In summary, numerous studies point to the polarization of labor markets in developed economies, with a declining middle class and movement toward a barbell-shaped economy with a small number of high-skill, high-pay jobs at one end and a large number of low-skill, low-pay jobs at the other end. This polarization is linked to and reinforcing of the stratification and segmentation of workers and societies along educational lines. There is significant inequality of opportunity, with one's outcomes strongly predicted by one's starting position in the income and education distributions. 

- Trump won the 2016 election by persuading voters that the political establishment was corrupt. He succeeded by shifting the political debate to focus on creating a new type of politics. 

- On the eve of Trump’s victory, the U.S. was prosperous and globally dominant. However, Trump portrayed the country as declining and portrayed government as squandering resources. 

- Trump’s victory surprised elites. They focus on Trump’s personality and see him as an aberration, but he reflects deeper political forces. Trump and Obama were both products of an American meritocracy. Obama embodied meritocracy’s triumph, while Trump exploited its discontents.

- Trump’s supporters felt mistreated and resented elites. They wanted to return to an imagined past. Trump won less educated and middle-income voters who felt disadvantaged by meritocracy. Elites disparaged Trump but lacked an alternative vision.

- Economic and political inequality have reinforced each other. At midcentury, equality in each sector promoted equality in the other. Today, inequalities in each sector compound the other. Meritocracy has generated an elite that dominates both economics and politics. 

- The meritocracy trap excludes many from economic opportunity and dignity. At the same time, it holds elites in a relentless pursuit of success that alienates them from their work and society. Meritocracy has failed to achieve its promised social mobility and equal opportunity.

- There is no easy fix. Promoting economic opportunity and security requires political reforms to curb elite power and privilege. Achieving a just, sustainable, and genuinely open society will require a long, difficult struggle. 

- Children born to highly educated, high-income parents have significant advantages over children from less privileged backgrounds. These advantages start even before birth and compound over a child’s early years.

- Children of elite parents are much more likely to be born into stable, two-parent households. Divorce rates are significantly lower for college-educated parents. Single-parent households are much more common among low-income families. 

- Elite mothers experience much less stress during pregnancy, which benefits their children's development. Their children are less likely to experience developmental delays and impairments. Elite parents are also better able to mitigate the effects of any stress after the child is born.

- Elite parents invest more time and resources in their young children. They spend more time actively engaging with and educating their children. College-educated parents spend over an hour more per day interacting with their children than high school-educated parents.

- The interactions elite parents have with their children are higher quality. They talk more with their children, use a larger vocabulary, and employ more complex language. By age three, children of professional parents have heard millions more words than children of welfare recipients.

- Elite parents expose their children to more culturally enriching activities like trips to museums, art classes, and historical sites. They are more than twice as likely to engage in these activities with their children as less educated parents.

- Elite parents employ a “concerted cultivation” approach that is designed to promote achievement and success. Their parenting strategies and techniques are more deliberate and effective at building skills and human capital.

- Elite children develop stronger emotional and social skills like self-confidence, self-discipline, openness, and perseverance. These “noncognitive” skills provide additional advantages for success and achievement later in life.

In summary, children of elite, highly educated parents gain substantial advantages through parenting practices and household environment from a very early age. These early advantages compound and interact with other opportunities to promote intergenerational transmission of status.  

• Attending selective, private colleges, especially those granting PhDs, leads to significantly higher lifetime earnings, on the order of 10 to 25 percent or more. Graduates of elite schools earn double the rate of return on tuition and often much more. 

• Degrees from the most elite schools can yield lifetime income gains of $2 million or more over average BAs. The top earners from elite schools make two to three times more than the top earners from average schools, even just a few years after college.

• Elite universities and professional schools are intensely hierarchical and exclusive. Just a tiny handful of institutions produce a large majority of leaders and professors in law, business, government, and other sectors. 

• The financial benefits of attending elite professional schools have skyrocketed over the past few decades. Law school and business school salaries that were once negligible now approach $200,000. The income premium for postgraduate education is 70 to 90 percent higher than in 1970.

• By attending elite law schools and business schools, graduates gain access to elite jobs with the highest salaries. Up to 60 percent of top law school graduates take jobs at large, prestigious law firms paying nearly $200,000.

• In summary, elite higher education has become a major mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of status and privilege. Graduates gain access to high-paying elite jobs and far outpace their less-privileged peers, financially and in career status. The rewards of this system have greatly intensified over the past few decades. 

- Meritocracy replaced aristocracy as the justification for social hierarchy and inequality. However, meritocracy is itself hierarchical and leads to dynasties. 

- Aristocrats claimed they deserved their status because of their virtue and character. However, the rise of commerce and democracy made these virtues seem absurd and corrupt. Meritocrats displaced aristocrats.

- Like aristocratic virtues, meritocratic virtues depend on context and can become worthless if the context changes. The skills and training that currently lead to high incomes for meritocrats would have little value in other societies or time periods. They exist due to inequality and a "skill fetish."

- The common argument that meritocrats deserve high pay because of their productivity is circular. Their productivity depends on the inequality and education system that produces their skills. Their skills are not deserved or justified. 

- A better measure of a worker's productivity considers how much output would change if that worker was absent but others were allowed to reorganize. By this measure, highly paid meritocrats may have little or negative productivity. They mainly prevent reorganization that could benefit others. 

- In summary, meritocracy is hierarchical, leads to dynasties, and depends on context. The merits and skills it rewards are artifacts of inequality, not deserved or natural. Meritocracy's justification of inequality is circular and unpersuasive. A deeper look at productivity suggests meritocrats do not deserve or generate their high compensation. Their skills and productivity depend on and perpetuate inequality and hierarchy. 

Michael Harrington’s 1962 book The Other America helped inspire the War on Poverty. It highlighted that about 50 million Americans still lived in poverty, despite postwar affluence. The book garnered significant attention and influenced policymakers. 

In his 1963 and 1964 State of the Union addresses, President Kennedy called for expanding the “war on poverty.” After Kennedy’s assassination, President Johnson pursued an “unconditional war on poverty” in America. In 1964, Johnson’s administration launched a legislative program including bills that would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, which established programs like VISTA, Job Corps, and Head Start.

The overall U.S. poverty rate declined from about 22% in 1959 to 11.1% in 1973. However, since then the poverty rate has fluctuated between 11% to 15%. Although transfer programs initially focused on the poor, their share of federal transfer payments has declined. However, income poverty still likely declined in absolute terms due to economic growth.

The Supplemental Poverty Measure, an alternative to the Official Poverty Measure, suggests poverty has fallen more substantially, from 25.8% in 1967 to 14.3% in 2015. The Supplemental Measure adjusts the poverty threshold and resource measure to account for government transfers, cost of living, and other factors.

So in summary, Harrington's book brought new attention to poverty in the U.S. and helped inspire Johnson's War on Poverty. Although the poverty rate declined over the following decades, it has remained persistently high. Alternative measures suggest more progress, but poverty remains an ongoing issue. 

The student-teacher ratio in private schools is 16:1. Three-quarters of teachers have advanced degrees. 

The black-white achievement gap used to be bigger than the rich-poor gap, but now the rich-poor gap is two to three times bigger, especially for children entering kindergarten.

Economic inequality and the academic achievement gap between rich and poor children have increased substantially in recent decades. Rich children now significantly outscore poor children in math and reading.

Only about one in two hundred poor children become rich, and one in fifty middle-class children become rich. In contrast, a child born into a wealthy family is likely to remain wealthy. Economic mobility in the U.S. is significantly lower than in other developed nations.

Residents of St. Clair Shores, Michigan, say they value their middle-class status and community, even if they will never achieve great wealth. It is psychologically preferable to be in the middle of your own community than on the margins of a wealthier one. However, mortality rates in the area have been rising, especially for middle-aged white men without a college degree. 

For two straight years, American life expectancy has decreased, due to “deaths of despair” like suicides, drug overdoses, and alcoholism. These deaths have increased much faster for less-educated whites. Billboards in St. Clair Shores advertise addiction treatment, reflecting the opioid crisis devastating the region. If mortality rates had continued declining at previous rates, half a million U.S. lives would have been saved from 1999 to 2013— comparable to the AIDS crisis. Economic distress seems to be fueling these “deaths of despair.” 

Law school graduates typically take short-term judicial clerkships for a year or two after graduating before joining private firms. Though reported as working outside large firms, these clerkships are understood as preliminaries to firm jobs. In fact, large signing bonuses for former clerks mean the clerks are indirectly paid by the firms. 

Top law schools' graduates have high salaries, around $400,000. Graduates of top-10 schools especially join and make partner at top firms at much higher rates than lower-ranked schools' graduates. Income and job differences follow from the schools attended.

Law school's financial value depends on the aid received. At full aid, the return on investment is around 32%; at $60,000 tuition, around 13.5%. Top business schools also yield high returns, often over $1 million. The 50th-ranked school's returns are far lower. About 25% of 2016 Harvard MBAs joined consulting firms. On average, an MBA's pay now exceeds $75,000. 

An BA "gets you in the door," but elite degrees are increasingly valuable. Despite predictions of much leisure, work hours remain long due to societal pressures. Calls continue for shorter workweeks, like 30 hours, to increase leisure. A century ago, Keynes thought high productivity could resolve "the economic problem" within 100 years, but human drives to work and proclivities to endless accumulation may preclude that. 

Though many hoped for a life of increased leisure and personal freedom, less work is not being realized or idealized. Labor force nonparticipation has risen, especially among prime-aged adults, indicating lost hope in the job market. Overall, the summary paints a picture of highly unequal economic outcomes and little progress toward an ideal of drastically reduced work hours or increased leisure. Educational elitism and social pressures prevent that. Here is a summary of the article:

- The share of prime-age adults not participating in the U.S. labor force is high compared to other advanced economies.  Among G-7 countries, only Italy has lower labor force participation for women. U.S. labor force participation is projected to continue declining.

- Unemployment is increasingly concentrated among the long-term unemployed, who have sought work for over six months.  In 1979, they were 8.6% of the unemployed, compared to 26.1% today.  

- The decline in work rates for prime-age men since 1965 represents the loss of 10 million jobs, mostly middle-skilled.  The work rate for prime-age men in 2015 was lower than in 1940, despite much lower unemployment.

- By 2050, male labor force participation is projected to drop 20 percentage points from 1950, and female participation to drop 6 points from 2010.  This would surpass the historic male-female gaps of 36 points in 1970 and 26 in 1980.  

- Those with middle-class incomes but no college degree, especially white men, have seen rising mortality from suicide, overdoses, and alcohol.  They are also a core part of Donald Trump's base.

-An "unequal terms" labor market gives disproportionate rewards to jobs demanding long hours, travel, and 24/7 availability.  This contributes to a "winner-take-all" society with little gain for most in climbing the ladder.  

- From 1946 to 1980, incomes grew fastest at the bottom and slowed higher up, with the median growing at the average rate.  Since 1980, only the top has captured income growth.  The top 0.1% took over half the total increase in U.S. income, while the bottom 90% saw annual income growth of only 0.01%.

In summary, declining labor participation, especially for less educated middle-class workers, and a winner-take-all economy have combined to limit opportunity and financial security for most Americans.  The long-term unemployed face particular difficulties.  These trends pose a risk of further deepening inequality and social tensions. 

- There has been a surge in investment in industrial robots, especially in Europe and Asia. In the US, the number of industrial robots has increased by 44% since the late 1970s. 

- Manufacturing employment in the US has declined steadily since the late 1970s, from about 19.5 million jobs to about 12 million today. However, manufacturing output has increased over the same period. The decline in manufacturing employment is primarily among middle-skilled, blue-collar workers. In contrast, employment of high-skilled, white-collar manufacturing workers has increased.

- There has been a polarization of the labor market into high-skill, high-wage jobs and low-skill, low-wage jobs, with a hollowing out of middle-skill jobs. The share of nonroutine cognitive jobs has increased by over a third since 2000, while the share of routine jobs has fallen. The pay gap between top managers and everyone else has widened.

- The polarization of the labor market and decline of middle-income jobs is linked to rising economic inequality and falling middle-class incomes. Studies show that states and countries with bigger increases in the income share of top earners tend to experience bigger declines in middle-class incomes.

- The hollowing out of middle-skill jobs and polarization of the workforce is occurring in many developed economies around the world. Studies of European economies and OECD data show a similar pattern of job growth at the high and low ends of the skill spectrum, but job losses in the middle.

- Examples like Kodak, which declined as digital photography grew, show how new technologies can eliminate many middle-skill jobs. In contrast, tech companies like Instagram create wealth with only a small number of high-skill jobs, relying on user-generated content from lower-skill individuals. 

McDonald's hired up to eighty workers in the mid-20th century and provided them systematic training, including at "Hamburger University." Workers could advance and even become executives, as Ed Rensi did, rising from grill man in 1966 to CEO in 1991. 

Today, McDonald's employs far fewer workers, who require little skill to prepare pre-packaged and pre-mixed food by just heating and assembling it. They are paid little, often minimum wage. McDonald's provides almost no training now. Hamburger University now focuses on incumbent managers and executives, especially foreign ones.

This illustrates a broader trend. New technologies have changed how goods and services are produced, transforming the nature of work. They have shifted jobs away from the middle of the skill distribution toward the extremes. Technologies reduce demand for mid-skilled workers and their wages. They increase demand for unskilled and especially highly skilled "superordinate" workers, widening inequality.

Technological innovations include hardware, software, processes, management techniques, and social/cultural changes like meritocracy. Together they disadvantage mid-skilled, middle-class workers but benefit the superordinate class, enabling its rise. Similar dynamics appear throughout the economy, e.g. in finance, management, retail, and manufacturing. 

In the mid-20th century, elite avoided finance jobs, filled by the middle class. Since the 1970s, new technologies favored super-skilled finance workers over mid-skilled ones. pay, jobs, and work transformed. Top workers now design complex, automated trading systems and new financial instruments, while traditional mid-level workers have declined. The new systems eliminate human judgment, minimally involving people to maintain them.

A "winner-take-all" dynamic and "skills-biased technological change" concentrate pay and jobs at the top. The skills and training that the new finance demands are rarely acquired through work experience but require elite educations. A degree is now a minimum credential even for an entry-level job.

In sum, new technologies in finance have polarized its workforce, reducing mid-skilled jobs and increasing demand for the highly skilled, who are highly paid. This parallels dynamics seen in McDonald's and the broader economy. 

- About 15% of applicants are accepted to top law schools. The median students at these schools have very high GPAs (around 3.7-3.91) and LSAT scores (around 170-173, which correspond to the 97.5th-99.2nd percentile).  

- The job market for new lawyers is now much more competitive than in the past. In the 1960s, there were fewer than 320,000 practicing lawyers in the U.S. Today there are over 1.3 million. The competition to get into top law schools—and for jobs at elite law firms upon graduating—is correspondingly intense.

- Students at top law schools can expect to pay around $90,000 per year in tuition and living expenses. These schools promote themselves as offering unmatched preparation and opportunities. 

- Lawyers at elite law firms work extremely long hours, often arriving at work before 9 AM and frequently staying past midnight. In the 1960s, top firms still maintained “bankers’ hours,” leaving at 5 PM. Today, such hours are a relic of the past. 

- A large majority of partners at the most profitable law firms graduated from top law schools (especially the top 5-10 schools). These firms have seen large increases in profits per partner in recent decades.

- While the jobs at elite law firms are highly paid, many lawyers find them unpleasant and unfulfilling. The long hours often crowd out leisure time, exercise, and relationships. Surveys show elite lawyers have high rates of dissatisfaction and depression.

- The increasing focus on elite degrees and jobs is misguided. These roles are not actually the most important or valuable in society. Nor do they provide as much life satisfaction as often assumed. A balanced life with time for relationships and leisure is more conducive to well-being. An exclusive focus on competition and status is counterproductive.

In summary, while top law schools and elite law firms have become more prestigious and profitable, they do not necessarily lead to a balanced or fulfilling life. An obsessive focus on competition and status can be counterproductive. A more balanced approach to work and life is superior. 

- Nearly 60% of children are born outside of marriage, and 40% of these mothers have children before marrying. College-educated women and women with post-college degrees are much less likely to have children before marriage. 

- There is a large and growing gap in single parenthood rates between women with college educations and women with less education. Around 15% of college-educated mothers are unmarried at first birth, compared to over 50% of mothers with some college education. 

- College-educated women typically wait 2 years after marriage to have children, while less educated women have children at around age 24, before marrying at around age 26.

- Divorce rates have declined for college-educated women but have increased for less educated women since 1960. About 35% of less educated women are divorced within 10 years of marriage, compared to 15% of college-educated women.

- Marriage is increasingly becoming “a rich person’s affair.” It is uncommon and unstable for those with low incomes and little education, while remaining the norm for those with high incomes and lots of education. 

- About 90% of children in households in the top third of incomes live with both biological parents, compared to about 50% of children in the bottom third of incomes. Economic troubles put strain on marriages, and women face greater economic risks after divorce.

- There are large inequalities in family structure that contribute to broader patterns of inequality in the U.S. Less educated individuals face more unstable relationships, single parenthood, and economic hardship. In contrast, highly educated, high-income individuals are much more likely to be stably married with two parents. 

- A survey of women on Wall Street found them disheartened by the difficulties of balancing work and family. The intense work demands lead to high burnout rates.  

- The divergence between the rich and everyone else in America has been growing for decades. In 1960, places like Palo Alto and St. Clair Shores had similar incomes and home prices. But over time, they have diverged dramatically. Now, median incomes and home prices in Palo Alto are roughly 20 times higher than in St. Clair Shores.

- Americans used to buy the same kinds of standardized goods, like cars from GM, Ford or Chrysler, appliances from Sears, and watches from Timex. But the rich now buy higher-end, customized and artisanal versions of the same goods. 

- The rich and non-rich also increasingly differ in how they marry, parent, worship, and live their lives. The rich see fitness as a status symbol, for example, and Google search data shows their interests diverging from those of the non-rich.

- This growing class divide between the rich and the rest worries many observers. While incomes in the middle and bottom have converged in recent decades, the lives of the rich have separated from the lives of non-rich in troubling ways. There is a risk of the rich and non-rich no longer understanding or sympathizing with each other. Here is a summary of the sources:

- Studies show Wall Street remains predominantly white and male, despite some modest gains in diversity. Women and minorities are underrepresented in leadership and higher-paying positions.

- A gender pay gap persists in many high-paying professions like law, medicine, and finance. Women face barriers like childcare responsibilities and career interruptions that make it difficult to catch up to men.

- There is a growing educated-affluent class in America that holds relatively liberal views on social issues like abortion, gay rights, and immigration. They tend to favor moderate or mixed views on economic issues like regulation, taxes, and spending. 

- The top income brackets now contain more Democrats and independents than in the past. But the wealthy still tend to hold more economically conservative views than the general public, especially on issues like social welfare spending, tax cuts, and financial deregulation.

- There is a disconnect between the ideological values of the educated elite and their self-interested policy preferences. Elite schools encourage civic values of equality, justice and public service but people’s views often become more economically conservative as they gain wealth and status.

- The priorities of the wealthy do not always align with the rest of the country. Issues like inequality, healthcare and education rank higher for most Americans while the wealthy focus more on lowering taxes, cutting regulation and fiscal discipline.

- Diversity and life experiences shape views more than schooling alone. Minorities and women who attend elite schools are less likely to adopt the economic conservatism common among white men. Place of origin and peer groups also have an influence.

In summary, while the upper class has become more socially liberal, deep divisions remain in their policy priorities and degree of concern over inequality. Economic self-interest and group allegiance continue to exert a strong influence over values. Simply attending an elite school does not necessarily foster more progressive views, especially on economic issues. Life experiences and peer groups are also very influential. 

- St. Clair Shores, Michigan is a predominantly white, middle-class suburb of Detroit. 
- The city has been declining in population and facing economic challenges. Nearly 1/3 of residents have left since 1970. The median household income has barely risen since 2000.
- The city lacks cultural amenities and entertainment options. Residents frequently travel elsewhere for dining, shopping, and recreation. The tallest building is only 6 stories. The only hotel closed down years ago.
- Most residents have some college education or an associate's degree. Fewer than 25% have a bachelor's degree. Almost no one is in the top 1% of incomes. 
- The public schools are underfunded compared to wealthy districts. Students have limited access to advanced courses and extracurriculars. Teachers are stretched thin across classes and grades.
- A large gap exists between the educations and opportunities available to children in St. Clair Shores versus those in elite, affluent communities. Students in wealthy districts have higher per-pupil funding, more teachers, and access to private fundraising. 
- In summary, St. Clair Shores represents the fate of the middle class in many once prosperous American towns. Lacking the advantages of the college-educated upper class, residents struggle in an economy that increasingly rewards high skills and advanced degrees. The community is left with a diminished tax base, underfunded public services, and limited opportunities for the next generation.

The summary touches on the key details around the town's demographics, economy, education system, and challenges compared to more affluent communities. The concluding paragraph draws these points together to characterize St. Clair Shores as emblematic of broader middle-class decline in America. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand the summary further. 

- Most teachers at top-ranked private high schools in the U.S. have advanced degrees. 
- These schools have extensive resources, including state-of-the-art facilities and large libraries. 
- Tuition at these schools exceeds $40,000 per year. They also receive large endowments and donations that provide an additional $15,000-$25,000 per student per year.
- There are also large inequalities in funding for public schools. Wealthy public school districts spend much more per student than poorer districts. Some wealthy public schools raise over $1 million per year in private donations and are nicknamed “public privates.”
- The funding gap between wealthy and middle-class public schools is much larger than the gap between middle-class and poor schools. Local funding, especially property taxes, accounts for most of the difference. 
- In total, the amount spent on a student’s education can range from $8,000 per year in a poor district to $75,000 per year at an elite private school. 
- The U.S. is one of only three countries where wealthier public schools spend more per student and have lower student-teacher ratios than poorer schools.
- Wealthy families also spend heavily on extracurricular activities and tutoring for their children. The private tutoring industry has become a multi-billion dollar business, with the wealthiest families spending up to $100,000 per child.

In summary, there are enormous inequalities in the U.S. education system, especially between the very wealthiest families and the rest of the population. The wealthiest families are able to provide their children with vastly greater resources through both private schools and public schools. They also spend heavily on private tutoring and extracurricular activities. These inequalities in education represent a vast and growing divide between the lives and opportunities of rich children versus middle-class and poor children. 

Management information systems and statistical techniques help companies monitor employees and detect fraud. Insurance companies use these systems to handle claims and reduce staffing. Skill polarization, with more high- and low-skill jobs, is occurring in insurance. 

Finance jobs require more education and pay higher wages than other sectors. The share of college graduates in finance increased sevenfold from 1980 to 2005. Top universities’ graduates go into finance at high rates. Despite finance’s employing a small share of the workforce, it captures a large share of top talent.

Early twentieth-century firms had many low-skill jobs and few managers. Assembly lines and scientific management led to the growth of middle-management. Unions gave workers power and provided an “alternative control center.” Union membership has since declined steeply.

Before the 1970s, major US corporations aimed to serve the national interest. For example, GM’s president said “what was good for the country” was good for GM. Corporations promoted high culture and intellectualism, e.g. Container Corporation’s “Great Ideas of Western Man” ad series.

Uber is an example of a large tech company with few employees. Despite being valued at over $50 billion, it has only about 16,000 employees. Tech companies are automating and eliminating many traditional jobs.

So in summary, major economic changes—including skill polarization, the decline of labor unions, the financialization of the economy, and the growth of large tech companies—have reshaped work in America and challenged the postwar compact between management and labor. Here's a summary:

- The average payday borrower makes $30,000 per year. Payday lending has grown into a $7.4 billion industry. 
- Income inequality has increased in the U.S., with the top 1% seeing their incomes rise much faster than the middle class. The middle class has had little income growth and has had to rely on debt to fund their consumption. 
- The costs of necessities like housing, healthcare, and education have increased much faster than incomes for the middle class. Their incomes have also become more insecure. This has led to more debt and financial insecurity.
- There is a growing market for ultra-luxury goods and services catering to the wealthy. The luxury goods market has been growing at over 10% per year, much faster than the overall economy. The costs of luxury watches, cars, homes, and meals have skyrocketed. 
- The gap between the middle class and the wealthy is leading to a social divide and stratified social interactions. The wealthy live increasingly separate and lavish lifestyles.
- Popular culture reflects this divide, with references to the wealthy upgrading from ordinary to luxury goods. But for most people, these types of luxury goods remain out of reach.

The key themes are increasing inequality, debt and insecurity for the middle class, the growing market for ultra-luxury goods, and the social ramifications of these economic divides. 

- According to estimates, lobbyists in Washington D.C. earned around $15,000 per year between 1969 to 1971. In comparison, a federal judge earned $30,000 per year and top lawyers earned $50,000 or more. The secretary of the treasury earned $35,000 per year in 1964. 

- Today, lobbyists, lawmakers, and government officials earn much higher salaries. A congressperson’s salary increased from $30,000 in 1960 to $174,000 today. Lobbyists’ salaries increased from $15,000 to around $2 million. Government officials’ salaries increased from $35,000 to $210,700. 

- The private sector also offers much higher pay. Law firm partners earn an average of $5.7 million. Supreme Court clerks earn $400,000 signing bonuses. CEOs earn tens of millions of dollars per year compared to government officials earning around $200,000.

- Critics argue this pay gap shows that government officials and staffers effectively become “barely disguised employment agencies” for lobbying firms and Wall Street. Lawmakers and staffers know they can earn much higher salaries as lobbyists once they leave public office.

- The prospect of high private sector salaries influences lawmakers and staffers while in office. For example, Congressman Eric Cantor was expected to become a lobbyist earning around $2 million after leaving Congress. The “revolving door” between government and business has long been an issue.

- Washington D.C. has become extremely wealthy due to government contracting, spending on lobbying, and the revolving door. Venture capital and lobbying have concentrated in D.C. Real estate values have skyrocketed. Washington is now one of the wealthiest cities in the U.S. with little industry besides the government.

- An example is Faiza Saeed, a partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, who earned over $10 million in 2018. As a daughter of Pakistani immigrants, her success story shows the opportunities in D.C. and New York for those with connections and skills valued by elite institutions. 

- Rich schools have more money to spend on high-quality teachers and facilities. They have teachers with more experience, more advanced degrees, and lower student-teacher ratios. Elite private schools spend 6 times more per student than public schools and have much better facilities. 

- The academic achievement gap between rich and poor students is now bigger than the gap between white and black students was in 1954. The gap between rich and middle-class students is bigger than the gap between middle-class and poor students. By the time students apply to college, rich students far outperform middle-class students, who slightly outperform poor students. Very few poor or middle-class students achieve at the level of rich students.

- Economic and educational inequality lead to limited social mobility. Children from poor and middle-class families have very little chance of becoming rich. Economic mobility is declining, and middle-class children today are less likely to out-earn their parents than in the past. 

- A cycle develops where elite graduates get the best jobs and develop technologies that benefit other highly skilled, highly educated workers. This enables elite parents to provide elite educations to their children, perpetuating the cycle. The gap between elite and middle-class wages and elite and middle-class investment in education shows how this meritocracy trap works.

- A bartender who grew up in St. Clair Shores and lived in Seattle illustrates these themes. In Seattle, he felt poor and excluded from a society built for the rich, even though he earned more. In St. Clair Shores, the middle class dominates, status depends more on community involvement, and more is accessible and affordable. However, meritocratic inequality is eroding the town's middle-class culture and democratic values. Life is getting harder, and feelings of success seem fragile when considered in a broader context.

The key ideas are that increasing inequality, especially between the rich elite and the middle class, is creating a cycle of unequal opportunity and limited social mobility due to unequal access to high-quality education and good jobs. This inequality and limited mobility pose a threat to middle-class communities and culture. Here is a summary of the working paper:

- According to the College Board, only 15-27% of students whose parents have a high school education or less meet the SAT benchmark for college readiness, compared to 52-68% of students whose parents have a bachelor’s or graduate degree.

- Elite high schools that serve affluent families, like Scarsdale High School, River Hill High School, and Weston High School, send 95-98% of their graduates to college. Top private high schools also send the vast majority of their graduates to elite colleges. 

- However, colleges overall have not become more selective over time. Admission to elite colleges has become more competitive, but admission to less-selective four-year colleges and open-admission two-year colleges has become easier.

- There is a growing gap in college attainment between students from high-income families and low-income families. Whereas in 1970 only 40% of students from top-income families earned a bachelor’s degree by age 24, today 71% do. For bottom-income families, the rate rose from only 6% to 10% over the same period.

- The effect of parental income on college entry and completion has increased over time. Students from high-income families are now much more likely to enter and graduate from college than students from low-income families. Completion rates are 97-99% for students from the top income quartile but only 21-51% for students from the bottom three quartiles.

- Universities exacerbate inequality because dropping out of college is very costly. Completing a BA provides income benefits that far outweigh the benefits of only “some college.” The added costs of dropping out make struggling to complete a degree worthwhile for affluent students but often insurmountable for low-income students.

- In summary, increasing college attainment overall has been accompanied by increasing inequality in college attainment, largely due to the greater college readiness and institutional support available to students from high-income families. This inequality threatens the American ideal of meritocracy and upward mobility. Here is a summary of the passage:

- The leisure class and elite sinecures were common in the early and mid-20th century. People like J.P. Morgan felt that the leisure class was necessary for civilization. Elites like bankers, lawyers, and executives worked short hours - around 30-40 hours per week - and had comfortable, clubbable lifestyles. 

- This started to change in the post-WWII period. Corporate raiders began targeting firms run by “lazy” managers and “third-generation Yale men.” New norms of efficiency and productivity began to emerge.

- Today, elite jobs require extremely long hours. Investment bankers regularly work 80-120 hours per week, sometimes up to 155 hours. Top executives at companies like Amazon and Apple are expected to be available and checking email at nearly all hours. 

- The hours of managers and executives have increased dramatically. In 1990, the average workweek for Fortune 500 executives exceeded 55 hours. 60% of CEOs worked over 60 hours per week, and executives reported their subordinates were also working longer hours. 

- Many executives now see the capacity for hard work and long hours as a key qualification for their jobs. They believe 50-60 hour workweeks are necessary to be competitive. Surveys show over 60% of high-earning individuals work over 50 hours per week.

- In short, the leisure class lifestyle has disappeared for elites. Today’s elite jobs are characterized by extreme workweeks, constant availability, and a ethos that valorizes overwork. The mid-century sinecure has been replaced by a relentless work ethic. 

- The average salary for top MBA graduates is $215,000, while the highest earners make over $1 million. Graduates from top programs earn double or triple the salary of graduates from lower-ranked schools. This is because top graduates get high-paying jobs in finance and consulting. For example, 28% of Harvard Business School's class of 2016 went into finance, compared to 1.3% in 1941.

- While a generic bachelor's degree provides a decent standard of living and protects against unemployment, it does not lead to high-paying jobs or significant wage growth. The value of a BA has declined as technological changes have made some jobs obsolete. 

- In the early 1900s, many predicted that technology would reduce work hours and increase leisure time. Thinkers like John Maynard Keynes predicted a three-hour workday within a century. However, this vision did not come to pass. While jobs are less labor-intensive and dangerous, and people are wealthier, inequality has increased. The middle class face unemployment, underemployment, and declining job quality.

- The prediction that technology would spread leisure and increase dignity for all was misguided. As technology concentrates high-paying jobs among the elite, it separates the middle class from meaningful work. Middle-class jobs are increasingly monitored, controlled, and degrading. For the middle class, idleness leads to loss of purpose and status rather than leisure. Meaningful work is now a privilege of the elite.

- Meritocratic inequality leaves the middle class without work or dignity. It frames their struggles as a failure of individual effort while concentrating advantage among the elite. This has fueled political anger, social dysfunction, addiction, and suicide among those without college degrees. For the middle class, the decline of stable mid-skilled jobs and the fetishization of elite "skill" lead to despair. 

- In summary, while technology has reduced difficult physical labor for some, it has not spread dignity or purpose. A system that concentrates advantage among the elite based on measures of skill and effort leaves others with little opportunity for meaningful work or social participation. This system fuels a range of social ills and threatens the promise of shared prosperity. 

- Technological changes have eliminated many middle-class jobs, reducing employment for mid-skilled workers. The jobs lost are similar to the number of hours women were excluded from the workforce in the mid-20th century. This has reduced income and status for the middle class. 

- However, new technologies have increased demand for highly skilled, elite jobs. The wealthy, educated elite work harder than ever before and work longer hours. They valorize hard work and industry over leisure.

- Elite jobs now pay exorbitant wages, up to $1 billion annually. The elite owe their wealth primarily to their labor, not inheritance. Access to elite jobs is based on skills and merit, attained through rigorous education and training.

- The new meritocratic system is a radical change from the old aristocratic system based on breeding and inheritance. Now, economic and social status are based on ability, effort, and productivity proven through competition in school and the workplace. 

- Elite education has transitioned from casual acceptance based on breeding to an intense competition based on merit. Admissions to top schools like Yale Law School are extremely competitive, admitting only the top fraction of applicants based on college grades and test scores. Students pursue elite schools based almost entirely on status and rankings.

- Elite schools provide intensive training, spending vastly more per student than average schools. Students follow a long chain of rigorous schooling from preschool through graduate school. Elite schools claim to provide the best education and preparation for leadership roles. These claims are supported by the intense competition for admission. 

- For decades, graduates of top schools have devoted themselves to rigorous study and training to gain admission and succeed at the most elite institutions. Their entire lives have been dominated by demonstrating their merit and gaining access to greater status and opportunity.

In summary, a new meritocratic system has emerged in which the elite gain status through demonstrated ability, effort, and skill. Access to elite jobs and education is highly competitive, and the elite work extremely hard to maintain their position, influenced by a culture that values industry and success over leisure or work-life balance. A hierarchy of schools rigorously trains and selects students, propelling them upward through immense investments of time, money, and effort. 

- Consultants are highly educated and elite. Top firms like McKinsey have “university-like capabilities” and can generate specialized insights, e.g. identifying the top cities for diaper sales in 10 years. 

- Advances in technology have allowed top executives to monopolize management functions and capture the economic returns. CEO pay has skyrocketed, up to $100 million for top CEOs and $20 million on average for the top 200. The CEO-to-worker pay ratio has increased 15-fold since 1965. The top executives of large firms capture 10% of profits.

- Other sectors have also eliminated mid-skilled jobs and polarized their workforces. Retail has shifted from small independent stores employing mid-skilled workers to large chains like Walmart and Amazon employing mostly low-skilled workers at low pay and a small elite workforce. Walmart’s CEO made over 1000 times the median employee in 2017.

- Mid-skilled clerical jobs like telephone operators, typists, and bookkeepers have been displaced by technology and outsourcing. Even arts and entertainment have seen “superstar” entertainers capture huge audiences and incomes, displacing those slightly less skilled. Beyoncé, LeBron James, and J.K. Rowling each made nearly $100 million in 2017, vastly more than average performers and creators.

- Manufacturing has eliminated many mid-skilled jobs through automation. The U.S. has lost nearly 8 million manufacturing jobs since the 1970s. However, high-skilled jobs designing and managing automated systems have increased. High-skilled manufacturing workers are more productive and better paid. Extreme examples of job polarization like Instagram, which employed only 13 people when sold for $1 billion, show the huge gains to the elite.  

- In summary, mid-century workplace democracy has given way to meritocratic inequality. Technology has eliminated mid-skilled jobs across sectors and polarized workforces into limited low-skill work and a small elite of highly skilled, highly compensated jobs. Manufacturing has declined in employment but increased in productivity through automation and high-skilled work. The economic gains have flowed almost exclusively to elite executives, managers, and knowledge workers. Here is a summary of the key points:

1) The U.S. population has grown significantly from 1965 to 2016. 

2) Only a small percentage of students at elite private schools receive financial aid. Even those who do receive aid are from upper-income families. Average tuition at private schools is almost $35,000 per year.

3) Elite private schools have very small student-teacher ratios, around 7:1, compared to 16:1 in public schools. They spend between $15,000 to $25,000 per student per year in addition to tuition. Over a student's career, this can amount to $700,000 in subsidies.

4) The average endowment of elite private schools is over $250 million, which amounts to over $350,000 per student. This endowment income funds about 37% of their budgets.

5) The average expenditure per student at public schools is $12,296. In contrast, elite private schools spend between $55,000 to $90,000 per student each year.

6) Public schools in the U.S. receive funding from state (45%), local (45%), and federal (10%) government. Funding varies significantly between states, from $18,512 per student in Connecticut to $7,928 in Mississippi.

In summary, elite private schools in the U.S. serve primarily upper-income students, charge high tuition, spend lavishly per student with the help of large endowments, and far outspend even the best-funded public schools. They are able to provide their students small class sizes, high per-student funding, and generous subsidies. 

- Researchers frequently analyze disparities in consumption in the US based on income. Surveys track consumption by income quintiles (fifths) and deciles (tenths). They show higher consumption by higher-income groups but only modest rises in top/bottom ratios over time. 

- Income and wealth inequality have risen sharply in the US. The top 1%’s income is 23 times the bottom quintile’s, up from 9 times in 1964. The middle class has shrunk. The US middle class is no longer the world’s richest.

- The Gini coefficient for US post-tax income has risen from 0.37 in the 1970s to 0.49 today. Most of the rise is from the top 1%. Inequality has risen little below that. There is debate on rises since 1993.

- Many see inequality as a moral problem that causes suffering. Critics counter that wealth is earned, not “given,” as some suggest.

- Democracies have long feared rule by a rich elite minority. But the US political system has not prevented rising inequality. Why? Some reasons:

1) People tend to see their own incomes as justified, even the very rich. This reduces support for redistribution.

2) Visible affluence at the top seems to validate the system. This also weakens redistribution support. 

3) The rich use their resources to shape policy and opinion in their favor. Regular people find it hard to organize in response.

4) Americans see opportunities for upward mobility, even if it is limited. This breeds optimism and acceptance of inequality.

- In sum, rising US inequality faces psychological, social and political obstacles. Simple fixes are elusive. Multiple approaches are needed to make progress. 

- Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush were born within 50 days of each other in 1946. They came from very different family backgrounds - Clinton's was middle class while Bush's was wealthy and patrician. 

- However, their different economic backgrounds did not greatly impact their childhood experiences. Clinton grew up in a stable, middle-class community and had access to opportunities like a good education. Bush also grew up in a middle-class neighborhood and lived a relatively modest life, marrying a middle-class woman. 

- In mid-20th century America, the economic elite and middle class were much more integrated. Blue-collar workers enjoyed higher wages and more rights. The GI Bill allowed more people to attend college. The economic elite had more moderate incomes and paid higher taxes. Regional wage differences were smaller.

- This economic integration fostered a shared American culture. The elite could not conspicuously spend on luxuries. Their lives were more similar to the middle class. Social connections crossed class lines more. Geography, religion, education, civic life, and pop culture were more unifying.  

- However, this began to change starting in the 1970s. Economic inequality rose, the elite became wealthier, regional differences grew, and the elite and middle class lives diverged. The modern "comprehensive divide" emerged, separating Americans along lines of income, education, geography, religion, and culture. This divide is reflected in increasing social distance and distrust between classes.

- The divide is problematic because it undermines solidarity and shared purpose. A healthy democracy requires connections between classes. As the divide grows, the elite become more isolated in their own experiences and worldview.

- Reducing the divide will require effort and institutional reforms. More economic opportunity and mobility, less inequality, and a shared sense of civic responsibility could help reintegrate American society. But ultimately, closing the divide is about rebuilding relationships and understanding across classes. 
- Emotional and social development in early childhood has an even bigger impact on later success than cognitive development. Children from elite households have big advantages in their early emotional and social development compared to ordinary children.
- Elite 3-year-olds are much more likely to attend preschool than ordinary 3-year-olds. Elite preschools focus intensely on children's emotional and character development to produce self-disciplined, motivated learners. They cost a lot of money and are very competitive to get into. 
- Elite 5-year-olds start kindergarten with huge emotional, social and academic advantages over ordinary children. By age 10, elite children outperform ordinary children in math, reading and science by 2-3 years of schooling. The gap between elite and middle-class children is bigger than the gap between middle-class and poor children.
- Elite parents continue to invest heavily in their children's development and education as they get older. They spend much more time talking, reading and doing activities with their school-age children. By age 18, elite children have spent 5,000 more hours on enriching activities and 8,000 fewer hours on screen time than poor children.
- Elite private schools are a major way that elite parents invest in their children's education. One quarter of children from families making over $200K attend private school, compared to only 5% of children from families making under $50K. Elite private schools spend huge amounts on small class sizes and highly educated teachers to provide intensive, personalized education.

In summary, elite children enjoy massive advantages in their emotional, social and cognitive development starting from a very early age. Their parents invest heavily in enriching their early experiences and education through preschool, activities, and private schools. These advantages compound over time and lead to much greater success. 

Meritocracy and the concept of merit it is based on are fundamentally flawed and serve to justify inequality. While meritocracy appears fair in principle, in reality it leads to a self-perpetuating concentration of advantage and the creation of an elite class that monopolizes resources and opportunity. 

The essay argues this occurs through several mechanisms:

1) The education system concentrates advanced training in a narrow elite, which then develops skills and technologies that only they can utilize, making them seem uniquely productive and valuable. But their productivity is an illusion that depends on suppressing alternative ways of organizing work that do not require elite skills.

2) The elite then claim their high pay is justified by their merit and productivity. But their actual contributions are offset by the losses and inefficiencies they create by distorting the system to favor their skills. Their pay far exceeds their real productive value.

3) This self-perpetuating system divides society into an elite that accumulates wealth through what is essentially rent-seeking, and an unproductive class that is denied meaningful work or opportunity. This undermines social solidarity and democracy.

4) The immense costs of this system in human and economic terms are justified by an appeal to the principle that pay should track merit. But this principle is revealed as a sham once we recognize how meritocracy creates the illusion of merit to justify inequality.

In sum, meritocracy leads to a ossified class system, deep social costs, and little real benefit—and the notion of merit used to defend it is unpersuasive. The essay calls for recognizing meritocracy as a “colossal wreck” that serves no one’s true interests. We must look beyond merit to find a fairer and more productive way of organizing society. 

The meritocratic system intensely commodifies human capital, especially of the elite. It makes an elite person's talents, skills, and training their greatest economic asset and source of status. To gain income and status, elite workers must ruthlessly develop and market their skills in ways that benefit others. They effectively have to manage themselves as an investment portfolio. This expands the commodification of resources to include human capital. 

Meritocracy “devours” elite workers by making them exploit their own human capital. It causes an alienation between elite workers and their own selves. Unlike for aristocrats, elite workers have no escape from this alienation. Meritocracy dominates all aspects of elite life, from childhood education to the demands of work. It leaves little room for following one’s interests or passions. 

Elite work becomes a means of extracting value rather than expressing the self. Elite workers often end up in jobs they would rather not do because their income and status depend so much on their human capital. They work obsessively long hours at these jobs. Meritocracy condemns elite workers to anxiety, inauthenticity, and alienation that no amount of wealth or status can relieve. 

The meritocrat’s path to wealth contrasts starkly with the aristocrat’s inherited security and entitlement. While traditional wealth allowed aristocrats to be their authentic selves, the meritocrat’s human capital condemns them to losing their authentic self. Meritocracy inflicts a “spiritual affliction” and “existential anxiety” on elite workers.

Even elite accomplishments reflect the self-suppression and suffering meritocratic competition exacts. Stories of elite students and workers boast of extreme sacrifices of self, leisure, relationships, and health for the sake of gaining status and income. The town of Palo Alto, a model of meritocratic schooling, shows the tragic results of these deformations of self. Here is a summary of the document:

- The document proposes expanding the social security tax base to include non-payroll labor income, such as fringe benefits, capital income and income of nonprofit institutions. This could double the revenue raised from the current system. 

- US colleges and universities spend over $500 billion per year, comparable to the federal government. Taxing their endowments and donations could generate substantial revenue.

- The document proposes using the additional revenue to provide wage subsidies for mid-skilled, middle-class workers. Paying subsidies to employers rather than employees would help support middle-class jobs and wages. 

- Providing wage subsidies to middle-class workers could cost around $150 billion per year. Some prominent business leaders and politicians have expressed support for federal wage subsidies.

- Wage subsidies could create an alliance between progressives, who want to reduce inequality, and conservatives, who want efficient free markets. By reducing distortions in the labor market, wage subsidies could benefit both groups.

- The slogan “same bosses, same fight” illustrates how middle-class and elite workers could unite to advocate for policies that benefit both groups. Meritocratic inequality harms both, so they have reason to work together. 

- Data shows that higher-income workers tend to work longer hours, indicating that meritocracy may encourage an “arms race” of escalating work hours and undermine work-life balance for elite workers. 

- In summary, the document argues that taxing sources of non-payroll labor income and using the revenue to provide wage subsidies for middle-class workers could benefit both groups, reduce inequality, support the middle class, and create political alliances to enact these policies. 

The view is too narrow concerning technology because it fails to recognize that many of the policies that it complains of (and even associated social norms) are best understood as themselves being technological innovations, produced by a new supply of super-skilled workers. And it is too shallow because it does not seek the root causes of the disproportionate influence that the present-day elite wield over policy, which is itself a consequence of new patterns in training, work, and pay.  

All in all, then, this expression of the progressive view recapitulates the errors of the earlier suggestion that economic inequality stems from a shift of income away from labor and toward capital. It inclines to moralize inequality as a product of individual choices, private vices, rather than seeking the deeper economic and social structures that govern behavior across the economic divide.

The top 1 percent of households now capture around 22 percent of all income earned in the United States, compared to around 11 percent in the decades from 1950 to 1970. Roughly two-thirds to three-quarters of the income of the top 1 percent comes from labor, not capital, and this income has ballooned disproportionately toward superordinate labor. Although the United States has higher inequality than many wealthy democracies like Canada, Japan, and Norway, it still has less inequality than many developing countries, including India, Morocco, Indonesia, Iran, Ukraine, and Vietnam. Even some cities, like Bangkok, Thailand, have higher inequality than everywhere in the United States except a few enclaves of extreme wealth. 

Snowball inequality threatens to render it increasingly indispensable as the incomes and standard of living of nearly everyone come to depend upon it. Over time, snowball inequality can seem necessary, natural, and inevitable, establishing a tyranny of no alternatives in societies where both the left and the right come to see themselves as defending meritocracy. But the usual laments about erosion of equal opportunity or talent often miss the real targets. Access to elite education, skill, and jobs depends on more than just intelligence or academic ability. It relies on connections, preferences, donations, and fraud, not just on good-faith judgments of merit. Even without nepotism, elite recruitment systematically favors the already advantaged.

Although legacy preference declines, elite schools offer large preferences to children of privilege. Donations and connections help secure places for underqualified students from wealthy families over better candidates from poor ones. The entire bottom half of the population by income is severely underrepresented at elite colleges. Wall Street firms could bet billions of dollars against their own clients because they had designed the investments to fail, even while assuring clients that the firms were betting along with them. The fines amounted to little more than a week’s profits. 

- Jobs are either subordinate (low-paying, low-status) or superordinate  (high-paying, high-status). There are few jobs in the middle. This results in a "winner-take-all" society with a vast gap between the elite and the middle class. 

- In the mid-20th century, income growth was distributed more evenly across the income distribution. The gaps between income levels were small. Since then, the gaps between higher income levels have widened substantially, especially at the very top. The competition is most intense to reach the highest levels.

- The demands of superordinate jobs are extreme. Workers have little work-life balance and face constant pressure to work long hours to gain status and income. The alternative is to take a subordinate job with less pay and status. The costs of leaving a superordinate job are high.

- Various factors contribute to overwork among elite workers: the need to signal high productivity when it's hard to measure, the desire for status, and a "rat race" effect where people work long hours to keep up with their peers. Overwork is higher in more unequal societies and industries. 

- The long work hours take a major toll on elite workers, causing health issues, strained relationships, and lack of leisure or personal time. Many report wishing they worked far fewer hours. The income and status gains do not offset these costs to well-being.

- Elite workers frequently compare their work demands to slavery, torture, or fighting. The long hours and lifestyle are seen as unsustainable and "no way to live." However, the costs of leaving are so high that people remain in overwork.

In summary, the summary describes how the modern economy concentrates opportunity and reward at the very highest levels of income and status. Competition to reach these levels results in extreme work demands and overwork that significantly undermine well-being, even for those who are most highly compensated. The costs of leaving this rat race, though, keep the overwork cycle going. 

- A large portion of high-income, highly educated individuals work extremely long hours. 35-50% work 50-80 hours a week. 9% work 100 hours a week. 

- Hours have increased dramatically for elite professions like lawyers, doctors, and executives. 70-80 hour weeks are common. Some report much longer hours during busy periods.

- There is a “time divide” between those working long hours and those working shorter hours. The share of people working over 48 hours a week has increased 50-100% since 1970. The share of couples working over 100 hours a week has also increased 50% since 1970.

- Rising income inequality corresponds with rising inequality in work hours and leisure time. High-income, highly educated individuals tend to work the longest hours while low-income, less educated individuals tend to have the most leisure time. 

- The connection between high wages, education, and long work hours is particularly strong for men. High-wage men are much more likely to work 50+ hours a week compared to low-wage men. Highly educated men have seen little increase in leisure time while less educated men have seen leisure time increase by 10 hours a week.

- The connection is less pronounced but still present for women. However, in two-income households, there is a strong correlation between total household income and total household work hours. Wealthy households are much more likely to have both partners working outside the home.

- Work hours have declined about 20% for the bottom 60% of earners since 1940 but have remained constant or increased for higher earners, especially the top 1%. The top 1% now works 30% more hours per week than the bottom 60%, a reversal from 1940.

- Adding up the numbers of high-paying, elite jobs suggests the top 1% of households, making over $475K per year, comprises about 1.5 million households. These households likely account for the bulk of the increase in hours worked at the top of the income distribution.

In summary, there is significant evidence that increasing income inequality is closely tied to increasing inequality in time allocation, with higher-income, highly educated individuals facing greater demands on their time through longer work hours, while lower-income, less educated individuals have gained more leisure time. The trend is starkest at the very top of the income distribution, where work hours have diverged most dramatically from the rest of the population. 

- Corporations and interest groups spend billions of dollars on lobbying in the U.S. This amount has increased dramatically in recent decades. 
- Much of this spending is tax deductible, allowing corporations and interest groups to lobby at a subsidized cost. This amplifies their influence.
- Elections are increasingly financed by wealthy donors and interest groups. Candidates spend much of their time fundraising from these sources. This influences who runs for office and the policies they support.
- Lobbying allows interest groups to directly shape legislation in their favor. It resembles a “legislative subsidy” where groups are essentially buying the laws and regulations they want. 
- The policies that result tend to reflect the preferences of the wealthy and business groups, not average citizens. A study found the preferences of higher-income citizens were strongly reflected in policy changes, while the preferences of middle-income citizens were mostly ignored.
- Industries like finance, accounting, and law have grown substantially in recent decades. Much of this growth is linked to helping wealthy individuals and corporations reduce their tax burdens and comply with regulations. This “income defense industry” has a vested interest in shaping policy to benefit affluent clients. 
- High levels of inequality combined with these political dynamics have allowed the wealthy to accumulate more wealth and influence, while average citizens struggle with stagnant incomes and declining political influence. This self-reinforcing cycle undermines civic equality and the principle that each citizen’s voice should count equally.

The key arguments are that large amounts of money flooding into politics, an “income defense industry” oriented around helping the wealthy, and high inequality have given the affluent disproportionate influence over policymaking. This threatens democratic values by amplifying the voices and interests of the few over the many. 

• Research shows teachers and schools have large impacts on student 
achievement, especially in math. High-SES students gain ground over the summer, 
while low-SES students fall behind. 

• The US has larger achievement gaps between high- and low-SES students 
than other nations. Low-SES US students perform several grade levels behind 
high-SES students.

• The income-achievement and education-achievement gaps in the US have grown
over time. On the SAT, the gap between rich and poor students is now around 250 points, 
and the gap between children of graduate degree holders and those whose parents did 
not finish high school is around 300 points.

• These large and growing gaps are problematic because education is key to 
opportunity and mobility. While college access has increased, college completion 
has risen much more for high-SES students, exacerbating inequality.

• There are many causes of these gaps, including: lack of access to high-quality 
preschool; less opportunity for enrichment activities; less access to private tutoring; 
lower teacher quality in schools low-SES students attend; less rigorous 
curricula at those schools; and less encouragement and support for college attendance.

• These trends should be of concern given the link between education and opportunity 
in today’s economy. Closing achievement gaps and promoting mobility will require major 
policy and social changes. 

- Income and wealth inequality grew substantially since the 1970s in the US. The rich accumulated more wealth and income while the middle class stagnated.  

- This inequality contributed to increased borrowing and debt among the middle class and expanding private borrowing in the economy. The diminishing marginal utility of consumption means that the rich will not consume much of their income, so they seek to invest it. At the same time, the middle class borrows more to maintain their consumption and lifestyles. Economic models show this relationship between inequality, borrowing, and aggregate demand.

- The rising volatility and insecurity of middle-class incomes also led to more borrowing. As income fluctuations increase, households borrow more to smooth consumption and as a way to cope during financial strains and reversals.  

- Policymakers were ideologically opposed to redistribution so they promoted policies to increase access to credit instead. This allowed for debt-financed middle-class consumption. The Federal Reserve's policies also bailed out investors and promoted this dynamic.

- The government promoted policies to expand homeownership through increasing access to mortgage credit. This further fueled housing price inflation and expanded borrowing using homes as collateral.  

- The shift in income from the middle class to the affluent and wealthy led to more instability and crises. Multiple analyses show this relationship empirically. 

- The financial sector grew substantially, from 2.8% of GDP in 1950 to 8.3% in 2006. Meanwhile, manufacturing declined. General Motors relied more on its financing subsidiary GMAC, showing the growing importance of finance over production.

- In summary, rising inequality, policies promoting borrowing over redistribution, the shift to finance, and promoting homeownership through loose credit all contributed to higher debt levels, financialization, and instability. Contingency and failures like in credit rating agencies also played a role but these structural factors were the primary drivers. 

- Meritocracy justifies economic inequality and obscures social class, denying ordinary people the language to articulate the harms of increasing exclusion. Unable to succeed in meritocracy, they construct nativist identity politics. 

- Meritocracy produces nativism and populism. It identifies expertise with elites, condemning ordinary people to internalize their own exclusion. Rejecting meritocratic institutions and expertise is necessary for self-respect.

- Resentment aims at professionals, not the super-rich. Professionals administer meritocracy, excluding ordinary people from income and status. Elite education harms non-elites by making their skills unproductive. The prosperity of professionals accounts for the hardship of others. The super-rich escape resentment because their privilege is unjustified by meritocracy. 

- Meritocracy leads to mistrust in institutions and the rule of law, seen as tools of elites. For non-elites to elevate rule of law over democracy is to accept disempowerment. Populism is a natural reaction to extreme inequality.

- Meritocracy is not innocent in the rise of nativism and populism. They represent a backlash against inequality from advanced meritocracy. They express the same forces driving social ills lowering life expectancy. These forces will lash out violently if unaddressed.

- After the financial crisis, an overconfident elite and demoralized public embraced policies increasing inequality. Obama’s meritocratic administration stabilized the economy but didn’t curb inequality or Wall Street power. His 2012 victory seemed to redeem meritocracy.

- The crisis continued. Populists Sanders and Trump seized the initiative, signaling the status quo’s failure. Elites dismissed the populist uprisings, remaining in denial even as Trump won. Trump repudiated the elite, striking nativist and populist notes. His victory showed the elite’s blindness and signaled an upheaval it couldn’t stop. 

- Meritocracy has led to social and economic inequality that undermines social solidarity. It creates isolated social classes that can invite class warfare. 

- The rich dominate political funding and policymaking. They spend heavily on campaign contributions and lobbying to influence politicians and policy. Politicians spend most of their time courting large donors. As a result, policy tends to favor the preferences of the rich over everyone else. 

- Meritocracy has also created a new class of highly skilled professionals, like bankers, accountants, and lawyers, who help the rich resist regulation and limit the power of the rest of the population. These "income defense industries" generate huge revenues helping the rich avoid regulation and taxation.  They are products of the meritocratic system of elite education and high compensation.

- The common view is that property rights are scale-blind - that small and large property owners have the same rights. But in reality, the size and type of property shapes the rights and protections it receives. The super-rich are able to resist regulation and limit the power of the rest in ways that the middle class cannot. Their property receives special legal protections not afforded to most people. 

- In sum, meritocracy has led to a new ruling class that is able to dominate politics and policymaking in order to advance their own interests. They undermine democratic self-government and equal treatment under the law. Their power and influence allows them to reshape society and politics to favor themselves over everyone else. 

- Survey evidence shows that even high-income professionals like lawyers would prefer to work fewer hours in exchange for lower pay, suggesting they are overworked. However, lawyers’ pay and hours have steadily risen in parallel. Law firms have increased hours rather than raising rates to fund higher pay. 
- There is a generational shift toward valuing time with family over higher pay, but this has not translated into lower hours. Surveys show both men and women value time with family over higher pay.
- The lives of top executives and professionals in the 1950s were far more modest than today in terms of housing, transportation, and consumption. They lived in unpretentious homes and drove ordinary cars. Today’s elites live in an “economic scale” inaccessible to most. 
- There were greater opportunities for social interaction across classes in the post-WWII era through civic organizations and public institutions like schools. Today’s elites are segregated. 
- The post-WWII era is often portrayed as one of great class mobility, but in reality class still powerfully shaped life outcomes, especially for African Americans. Racial inequalities were enormous. 
- Today, the cumulative effects of class and race lead to much greater inequality. For example, high school dropout black men have a 59% chance of going to prison, while college-educated black men have a 5% chance.

In summary, while the post-WWII era saw greater class cohesion and mobility than today in some dimensions, racial inequality and the power of class were still enormous, especially when interacting. The lives and opportunities of elites and professionals were far more modest and integrated with those of ordinary citizens. Today’s elites live in increasing isolation in “economic and social space[s]” that most cannot access. 

•Poverty in the U.S. has declined dramatically since the 1960s by most measures. The official poverty rate has fallen from over 20% to around 13%. Supplemental poverty measures that account for government benefits show even sharper drops, to below 5% according to some estimates. 

•The living standards of the poor have risen substantially. The poor today live lives comparable to the middle class of the 1960s in terms of consumption. They have much better access to basic goods like food, housing, healthcare, and transportation.

•Key measures of well-being like life expectancy, health, education, and economic opportunity have increased across the board. However, the gains have been smaller for the poor compared to the rich. Inequality remains a serious issue even amid progress.

•Poverty is no longer as dire or inescapable as in decades past. While more remains to be done, the U.S. has had considerable success in ameliorating the worst deprivations. However, high incarceration rates among the poor are not accounted for in official poverty statistics and remain a problem.

•Income and wealth inequality have risen substantially since the 1970s, even as living standards have increased across the board. The share of income and wealth accruing to the top 1% has skyrocketed. Consumption inequality may not have risen as much but data limitations make this hard to determine definitively.

•There have been huge improvements in human development and standards of living over the long run in the U.S., but some disparities remain, especially in areas like healthcare, education, and economic opportunity. Further progress on inclusion and equity is still needed.

In summary, poverty and deprivation have declined dramatically in America over the past half century according to most metrics, though more remains to be done to promote inclusion, equity and shared prosperity. Income and wealth inequality have risen substantially, posing challenges that remain to be addressed. But by historical standards, even the poorest Americans today live lives of greater health, comfort and opportunity than in decades past. Standards of living have advanced across the board, even if some gaps remain. Here's a summary:

As online retail and big-box stores gain market share, smaller brick-and-mortar stores and retail employment are declining. Employment has decreased in secretarial, clerical, and data-entry jobs as automation and technology reduce the need for human labor in those roles. 

In entertainment and sports, “winner-take-all” markets mean the top performers—like pop stars, movie stars, and professional athletes—are capturing a larger share of revenues. Average performers and backups are seeing little gains. CEO and executive pay has also risen much faster than pay for most workers.

Walmart’s low profit margins mean that even if the company paid workers more, their wages would still be far below the manufacturing wages of the past. Inequality is largely the result of technological and economic shifts, not businesses exploiting workers.

Investment in robotics and automation is accelerating. The robotics market and patent filings are growing rapidly. Many jobs, like manufacturing, transportation, and fast food work, are at high risk of automation. While new technologies often create new jobs, they may not replace the lost jobs quickly enough. There is concern that automation will significantly disrupt labor markets and make inequality worse.

There is active debate on how to ensure that the benefits of technological progress and economic growth are broadly shared. Options like a universal basic income, job retraining programs, public works projects, and tax reform are being considered. With increasing inequality and job insecurity, these issues will likely remain at the center of political and economic debate. 

The relationship between the tertiary wage premium and the effect of parents’ education on children’s skill shows that skill concentration and training focus differ across countries together, not separately. 

Figure 12 shows the percentage of children who earn more than their parents at midcentury and today based on the parents’ income ranks. Almost all children born in 1940 earned more than their parents except children of the highest earners. For children born in 1980, the odds of earning more than parents decrease with increasing parental income ranks until falling again for children of the highest earners. The decline is biggest for children of middle-class parents hit hardest by wage stagnation.

Table 1 shows the difference between typical elite and middle-class investments in human capital. Even with conservative estimates, the sums show the exceptional investments elites make to reproduce themselves. The numbers do not include non-cash contributions, quality, lower stress, neighborhood, time, education, peer effects, and parental skill in educating children.

Table 2 calculates the meritocratic inheritance using the numbers in Table 1. Assuming elites have children at 30, die at 80, and get an 8% return, the total equivalent inheritance is $16.8 million. At a 6% return, it is $8.8 million. The assumptions are conservative given higher average ages of first birth and life expectancy for elites and higher historical market returns.

In summary, the tertiary wage premium and effect of parental education on children’s skill vary jointly across countries, demonstrating skill concentration and training focus differ together, not separately. Tables show the substantial investment and inheritance advantages elites provide their children, which likely underestimate the true differences from middle-class opportunities. 

•Admission to elite preschools in New York City is highly competitive, with acceptance rates comparable to Ivy League colleges. Parents go to great lengths to help their children get accepted, sometimes hiring expensive admissions consultants and coaching their kids for school visits.

•A child’s cognitive abilities and skills are largely developed by age 10, and the achievement gap between rich and poor students is already wide when children enter kindergarten. Interventions to address this gap are most effective when children are young. 

•Elite preschools claim that their students go on to attend elite colleges, illustrating how advantage is passed down over generations. 

•The parenting practices and home environments of high-income families give their children major advantages. Rich children have far more opportunities for enrichment, spend less time watching TV and more time engaged in educational activities with their parents, and enjoy extensive exposure to new places and experiences. By age 18, the difference in life experiences between rich and poor children amounts to over 10 years’ worth.

•Private school enrollment has skyrocketed since the 1960s as wealthy parents have sought exclusive educational opportunities for their children. Some affluent families even hire private tutors and chefs for their children.

•Inequality in access to resources and opportunities at an early age locks in inequality later in life. The achievement gap between rich and poor students continues to widen over the course of their schooling.

•Spending money on young children’s education brings the highest returns on investment. But while the wealthy are able to invest heavily in their children from an early age, most families do not have the means to do so. This disparity in investment helps perpetuate the cycle of inequality.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key points and evidence presented in the sources? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand the summary in any way. Here is a summary of the key points:

- Success in a meritocracy is winner-take-all: the alternative to victory is elimination. This creates intense competition.

- Wealth in a meritocracy liberates owners from responsibilities and constraints, allowing them to focus on their interests and ambitions. 

- The concept of “human capital” became popular in the 1960s, just as meritocracy began to take hold. It treats individuals as commodities.

- Very few jobs provide meaningful work or financial security. Most people face precariousness and overwork. 

- The pressures of meritocracy create psychological distress and health issues, even at elite institutions. Students feel intense pressure to achieve and curate a perfect image. 

- Places like Palo Alto, California demonstrate the extremes of meritocracy. Incomes and home values there vastly outstrip national averages. The public schools have immense resources. Students achieve at an extraordinarily high level.

- In contrast, a city like St. Clair Shores, Michigan has far fewer resources and opportunities. This shows the vast inequalities that can emerge in a meritocratic system.

- In general, meritocracy has led to a culture where "the alternative to victory is elimination," creating a "winner-take-all" society and economy with large inequalities and segregation based on education and skill. 

- Higher-income, college-educated parents are more likely to expose their children to arts and culture, enroll them in extracurricular activities, and converse more with them from an early age. 

- By age 3, children of professional parents have vocabularies up to twice the size of children from families on welfare. Children acquire language more quickly in higher-income homes.

- Higher-income parents are less likely to use physical punishment and more likely to show affection. These parenting differences contribute to long-term gaps in children’s health, education, and economic outcomes.

- Higher-income children are more likely to attend preschool, giving them a head start academically and socially. For example, at New York City’s Ethical Culture Fieldston School, where tuition exceeds $50,000 per year, only 7% of students come from families earning under $75,000. Admission to elite preschools is often more competitive than admission to top colleges.

- In summary, higher-income parents confer substantial advantages through differences in child-rearing practices, access to preschool, and enrollment in enriching activities.  These class-based differences in child-rearing and early education contribute to the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status. 

- Meritocracy has created inequality over generations and will take generations to fix. Studying the problem shows the path to reform.

- Reformers must target the two mechanisms that caused meritocratic inequality: education and work.

- Education reform: Make elite education open and accessible. Reduce competitiveness and intensity. Leverage unfairness of current system to push for reforms. Elite schools get huge tax benefits but functionally act as exclusive clubs that benefit the already privileged. Reforms could require schools to draw half their students from lower-income families to get tax exempt status. Funding could help schools expand to meet this requirement. This would spread elite education and shrink the gap between rich and poor education.

- Populists and elites should support education reform. Current system burdens elites and no child is safe. Reforms would increase number of rich students accepted, reducing competition. This would benefit elites. Inclusive education would benefit schools' mission and be better than likely populist alternatives. 

- Work reform: Promote ways of producing goods and services that favor middle-skill workers. Current policy ignores this. Possible policies include subsidies, grants, and tax benefits for companies that employ more middle-skill workers. Government funding for vocational training and education. Zoning and licensing changes to enable smaller-scale production. Antitrust enforcement to reduce concentration of industries that once depended on middle-skill workers.

- Generational reform is flexible, opportunistic, and pragmatic. It starts with education and work reform but adapts based on experience. The goal is democratic equality and shared prosperity. The path there can't be spelled out in advance but must be explored through action. 

New technologies typically build on and exploit the existing resources and assets of a society. This has been the case throughout history. Societies develop technologies suited to their circumstances, whether abundant water, land, labor, or other factors. 

In recent decades, human capital, especially elite skill, has become the most important economic resource. New technologies have developed to leverage these skills. In the 19th century, the new supply of unskilled labor in England drove the development of technologies suited to unskilled factory work. In contrast, the rise in college education and elite skilling beginning in the 1960s and 1970s drove the development of skill-biased technologies.

There was a lag between the rise in college education and the demand for and rewards to college skills. In the 1970s, the supply of college grads rose but their wages dropped. Beginning in the 1980s, the demand for and wages of college grads rose steeply. This pattern suggests that the new supply of college grads drove innovations to leverage and reward their skills. 

A similar pattern holds for elite, super-skilled workers. The supply of these workers rose from the 1970s due to meritocratic education reforms and a culture valuing hard work. Initially, the rewards to super-skills dropped. But then, beginning in the late 1970s and accelerating in the 1980s, the income share of the top 1% rose dramatically. Again, the new supply of super-skilled workers appears to have spurred innovations to leverage and reward their skills.

Germany provides a useful contrast. Germany educates its population broadly rather than concentrating investments in an elite. Germany provides intensive vocational education and training. As a result, Germany has not seen the same rise in inequality and division into gloomy and glossy jobs as in the US. The German system suggests that the US emphasis on elite education and neglect of vocational training has contributed to its inequality.

In summary, new technologies emerge to leverage the resources and assets in a society, including and especially its human capital and skills. The rise in elite education and skills in the US since the 1960s drove the development of skill-biased innovations that have concentrated rewards at the top. A broader, more equitable approach to education and training, as in Germany, could produce a more equitable distribution of economic rewards. Here is a summary of the sources:

- An October 2014 Business Insider article reported that the government spends more per student at private universities than public ones.

- According to a September 2017 email, a Yale University official said the school designed its new buildings to last indefinitely.  

- According to a 2015-2016 financial report and U.S. News & World Report, Princeton University is a top private university that serves mostly wealthy students.

- Elite private schools and universities should increase economic diversity by admitting more students from lower-income families. They could give admissions preferences to students from high schools with more economic diversity. Publications that rank colleges could consider schools’ economic diversity in their rankings. Some universities like Arizona State have increased enrollments while lowering costs.

- If elite schools became more inclusive, their student bodies might initially lack diversity since their typical applicant pools skew wealthy. It may be better to start increasing inclusiveness earlier, in K-12 schools. 

- The 2017 Republican tax bill imposed a 1.4% tax on private college endowments, which some politicians have argued do not adequately support students from lower-income families. However, some oppose these efforts due to partisan political motives or a desire to reduce competition for admission to elite schools.

- When Yale University first admitted women in 1969, it increased class sizes instead of displacing men, allowing it to maintain its reputation for training future leaders. Expanding elite schools could similarly reduce competition among wealthy applicants by increasing acceptance rates. However, elite schools aggressively resist even modest proposals that could reduce their wealth, such as taxes.

In summary, some argue elite private schools and universities should increase economic diversity but face obstacles including a lack of lower-income applicants and a desire to maintain selectivity. Taxing endowments could encourage more inclusiveness, but politicians' and schools' motivations are complex. Expanding elite schools might reduce admissions competition among the wealthy, as when Yale first admitted women, but schools aggressively defend their privilege. 

- Expenditures on higher education in the US have grown enormously, increasing from $142 billion (2.2% of GDP) in 1970 to $532 billion (3.1% of GDP) in 2014. This growth has far outpaced enrollment growth, so per-student spending has increased about 60% since 1970. Spending has grown fastest at elite schools, with top schools spending $92,000 per student per year, compared to $12,000 at less selective schools. 

- Much of this increased spending is subsidized, not paid for by students and families. The richest 10% of colleges get 80% of their funding from subsidies, while the poorest 10% of colleges get only 22% from subsidies. Government funding, endowments, and tax exemptions all provide subsidies. Subsidies to top schools have grown the most, with top schools getting $75,000 per student in 2007, up from $7,500 in 1967. Less selective schools get only about $5,000 per student.

- Graduate and professional school has become increasingly important for elite jobs. While elite jobs once did not require advanced degrees and provided extensive on-the-job training, now graduate degrees are typically required before getting elite jobs. Changes in the nature of work, corporate organization, and labor markets have reduced incentives for firms to provide on-the-job training and long-term job security. 

- Nearly all doctors now pursue medical residencies and fellowships after their MDs. Nearly all lawyers pursue JDs from law school. Nearly all elite managers and consultants pursue MBAs from business schools. While most top executives lacked even bachelor's degrees in the 1930s, now nearly all have at least bachelor's degrees, and most have advanced degrees. Graduate and professional school has become deeply entrenched in career paths to elite jobs.

- In summary, higher education in the US disproportionately benefits students from wealthy families, through increased spending, subsidies, and expanded advanced degree requirements for access to elite jobs. This system perpetuates inequality and limits upward mobility. 

- The middle class have little choice but to pay whatever taxes and follow whatever regulations the government imposes on them. The wealthy, however, have substantial resources and power they can leverage to resist government rules andtaxes. They can hire accountants, lawyers and lobbyists to help them shelter their income and avoid regulations. 

- Meritocracy has enhanced the power of the elite to resist government intrusion. It has created highly-paid private sector jobs like investment bankers, accountants and lawyers whose role is to help the wealthy avoid taxes and regulations. Historically, the most educated and skilled workers worked in government, the military or the church because the private sector did not value or pay for their skills. Now the private sector pays far more, so the talentedgravitate to those jobs.

- The salaries of lobbyists, top lawyers and bankers far outstrip government salaries. Elite government workers may make a good living, but they naturally envy and seek to join the truly wealthy elite in the private sector. Government jobs have become "barely disguised employment agencies" connecting officials to future private sector jobs. Many politicians become lobbyists when they leave office. 

- The flow of talent into the private sector jobs that influence government policy is enormous. The Washington D.C. area has seen a huge influx of rich households and college graduates due to this trend. An entire industry now exists to help the wealthy avoid taxes, regulations and other "ways of expropriating wealth." 

- The estate tax is a prime example. Aggressive lobbying and planning have weakened it so much that almost no one pays it. The tax rates on the wealthy have declined substantially. The rich are able to overcome even direct efforts to regulate them, as evidenced by the lack of prosecutions of Wall Street figures after the financial crisis. 

- In summary, meritocracy has given the elite the means to effectively resist government control and become ungovernable. This is reminiscent of the Middle Ages when nobles and the crown competed for the loyalty of knights, and social status was detached from secular political power. Private wealth can now directly challenge the state. 

- According to estimates, in 2012, 77 of the 1,226 people on Forbes’s list of billionaires were financiers and 143 were investors. Many had investable assets of over $30 million.

- Top finance professionals can earn very high salaries, often $500,000 or more per year. Their pay has risen much faster than for other workers. However, some reports indicate their pay may have recently declined.

- Historically, getting a loan or insurance claim approved involved personal judgment about a borrower's character and capacity to repay. Loan officers and claims adjusters had to evaluate applicants and claims carefully. 

- Over time, finance has become more automated and impersonal. Loans and claims are now evaluated and processed based on hard data and algorithms. This allows firms to handle much higher volumes but reduces human judgment. 

- Major regulatory, theoretical and technological changes enabled the growth of securitization and complex finance. Regulations like Glass-Steagall were repealed. Theories like portfolio optimization and options pricing were developed. And computing power and spreadsheets enabled large-scale data analysis and trading.

- Finance firms now evaluate and process loans, claims and other transactions in a routinized, assembly-line fashion based on algorithmic scoring models. This reduces the role of mid-skilled workers and their independent judgment. Higher-skilled "meritocrats" design the models and systems.

- In insurance, traditional claims adjusters who would investigate and evaluate claims are being replaced by deskilled workers who just input data into algorithms. The algorithms then determine whether and how much to pay for claims.

So in summary, the key points are the growth of large-scale, data-driven, and algorithmic finance; the declining role of mid-skilled workers and human judgment; the rise of a new technical and meritocratic elite; and the major changes that enabled these shifts. 

The sloping dark gray line shows that income inequality in the U.S. has increased sharply since the 1960s. The light gray line shows that inequality has decreased slightly for the bottom 70% of income. The dashed black line shows that inequality within the top 5% has skyrocketed. So, inequality has shifted to higher up the income distribution.

Figure 5 shows that rich households invest much more in education for their children relative to the middle class. Middle-income households do not invest more relative to poor households. Another series shows the super-educated invest more relative to the ordinarily educated. This corresponds to the income inequality trends.

Figure 6 shows that the achievement gap between rich and middle-income students has grown, while the gap between middle-income and poor students has stayed steady or declined. Again, this matches the income inequality trends. 

Figure 7 shows that the finance industry has shifted. Before the 1980s, finance grew by hiring more mid-skilled workers. Since the 1980s, finance’s share of GDP has grown while employment has declined. Finance workers have become more highly educated and paid. They earn a stable share of a growing pie, indicating they have become an elite.

Figure 8 shows a decline in mid-skilled jobs and an increase in high-skilled jobs over the past few decades. About a quarter of mid-skilled jobs have been lost. High-skilled jobs have increased by nearly a third.

Figure 9 shows income is highly segmented by education level. Very few people without a college degree earn as much as the median college graduate. Almost no one without an advanced degree earns as much as someone with an advanced degree. Those with less education struggle while those with more education prosper.

Figure 10 shows that consumption for the bottom 90% of households has steadily increased since the 1940s. Income rose with consumption until 1975, then stagnated. Debt began rising sharply in the 1970s to sustain consumption as incomes stagnated, indicating borrowing props up living standards in the face of inequality.

Figure 11 shows that countries with higher returns to college education (college wage premium) tend to have more unequal investments in education (measured by the effect of parent's status on child's skill). This indicates a vicious cycle of inequality. 

- Elite students today face significant “challenges” and mental health issues due to the intense competition and anxiety over their performance and futures. What was once a marker of elite status and privilege has become a relentless struggle to gain or maintain that status. 

- Critics argue this high-pressure environment produces students who lack purpose or meaning in life and see education as merely a means to an end. A study found elite students would be willing to do useless work for 15 hours a week just for a career advantage, showing how they have been trained to exploit themselves.

- However, these issues are not due to any moral failings of elite students or their parents. They are the inevitable result of an unequal, competitive meritocratic system where only exceptional students can afford to value education for its own sake. Most students must focus on the external rewards of education to succeed. 

- In the mid-20th century, elite jobs provided lifetime employment and pay was based primarily on years of experience. CEOs did not need to be highly ambitious or competitive. This has changed with meritocracy, as elite jobs now emphasize high skills, effort, and competition. Technological changes have polarized the job market into “gloomy” low-skill, low-pay jobs and “glossy” high-skill, high-pay jobs.

- Gloomy jobs provide little opportunity for reward or advancement. Glossy jobs appear desirable but often require long, stressful hours and pressuring people to value work over all else. As technology progresses, more jobs become gloomy and fewer become glossy.  
      
-  Historically, informal eateries employed mid-skilled workers and paid relatively well. Fast food chains initially followed this model, with McDonald’s employing 70 mid-skilled workers per restaurant in the 1960s. But new technologies have allowed chains to minimize staffing, so most jobs now require little skill and pay very little. A modern McDonald’s employs only 7 workers.

- In other sectors, new technologies have similarly polarized jobs into a few highly paid roles requiring advanced degrees and many low-paid roles requiring little training. Jobs in the middle have been decimated. This trend will likely continue, further diminishing mid-skilled work.  

In summary, new technologies and an unequal, competitive social system have polarized the labor market, diminished mid-skilled work and the middle class, and produced an elite class riddled with anxiety and lack of purpose. For most, the modern economy offers little opportunity for stability or advancement. 

- Life expectancy is increasing in wealthy nations but declining in poor nations, leading to a growing gap. For example, life expectancy for women in eastern Kentucky declined by over a year between 2007 and 2011. 

- The life expectancy gap between the U.S. and Nicaragua is four years. Curing all cancers would increase life expectancy by the same amount.

- Economic inequality is contributing to health inequality. Lifestyle and wealth shape a person's health and longevity. The rich and poor are living such different lives that they are almost like separate populations.

- Starting in the 1970s, stagnating wages prevented the middle class from increasing their income. However, social pressures and economic needs required the middle class to increase consumption. With tax cuts favoring the rich and rejecting redistribution, the middle class turned to borrowing and debt to fund lifestyle growth. 

- The government promoted policies that encouraged borrowing, especially for home mortgages. Households borrowed between 25 to 30 cents for every dollar increase in home value. Debt replaced income as the main funding source for middle-class consumption growth.  

- While income for the bottom 90% was stagnant after 1975, debt and consumption continued to rise. The scale of middle-class borrowing matched the flow of wages to the top. Economist Joseph Stiglitz argues this debt-fueled growth hid the impacts of inequality and stagnation.

- The growth of the financial sector was fueled by inequality-driven borrowing. The financial sector's share of GDP doubled since 1970 and now approaches manufacturing's share. Finance shifted the economy's center of gravity away from Main Street toward Wall Street.

- About one-quarter of financial growth came directly from rising household debt, especially mortgages. One-half came from serving the wealthy through asset management and securitization of debt. The housing market and inequality drove financial growth.

- At the same time, "rocket scientists" with advanced physics and engineering degrees joined Wall Street, bringing innovations that favored the skills of this elite workforce. Government funding for research had declined, leaving many with PhDs without academic jobs, so they went to Wall Street. 

. Albertsons 
•Albertsons acquired Safeway through a merger in 2014.

•Steven A. Burd served as CEO of Safeway for over 20 years, from1993 to 2013. Under his leadership, Safeway grew significantly through mergers and acquisitions in the transportation and energy industries.

. CEO compensation at Safeway 
•After Safeway's leveraged buyout in 1986, CEO pay increased dramatically, from 40 to 110 percent of base pay. CEO pay continued to rise over time. By 2015, the CEO's pay was over 350 times that of his predecessor in the 1960s.

. The Industrial Revolution and skill bias
•The Industrial Revolution introduced new technologies like the mechanization of textile production that replaced skilled workers with unskilled workers, depressing their wages. 
•Mass production using interchangeable parts dramatically reduced the need for skilled mechanics in industries like car manufacturing. The fraction of skilled workers declined while the demand for unskilled workers rose.
•Some economists and sociologists initially believed that technological change would decrease inequality by increasing the demand for unskilled labor. However, technology has increasingly favored and complemented skilled workers, contributing to rising inequality.

. Technology as a social product  
•New technologies do not arise in a vacuum but are shaped by social institutions and incentives. The technologies that are developed and implemented in a society depend on opportunities for profit, the availability of resources, and existing skills and productive techniques. 
•Cultural attitudes and social institutions have influenced the development of technology. For example, the availability of slave labor and the low social status of practical knowledge and skills inhibited technological innovation in ancient societies. Environmental and geographical factors also help determine a society's technologies of production.

•Economists distinguish between all theoretically possible technologies (the meta-production function) and the technologies that are actually developed and adopted in a society (the actual production function). The actual technologies developed reflect social and economic forces. 

Elite families today are fundamentally different from middle-class families in how they are composed, their legal structures, and their domestic habits. Elite families tend to intermarry, stay married, and raise children within marriage to serve the goal of passing on status to their children. Divorce is less common among elites because it is costly, distracts from work, and complicates raising high-achieving children. Children born outside of marriage are almost unheard of among elites. 

Elite ideals of family and marriage reflect these realities. Elite children feel pressure to achieve to advance their families’ status. Sibling rivalry is more intense in elite families. Elites view marriage more ideologically and report higher happiness in their marriages. Elites embrace more traditional sexual morality in their own lives while supporting more progressive values in the abstract.

Elite families are more involved in community activities, religious observance, volunteering, and report higher social connection and trust. Gender dynamics in elite families are complex. While elites embrace egalitarian values, elite jobs remain male-dominated. Elite women often leave the workforce to focus on raising children. Among non-elites, women are more likely to out-earn their husbands.

There are vast divides between how elites and non-elites understand challenges to and hopes for marriage and family. For elites, same-sex marriage is central, while for non-elites, the decline of opposite-sex marriage is paramount.

Meritocratic inequality also divides Americans’ cultures, including religion, politics, socializing, and leisure activities. Religions in the U.S. have become segregated by social class. Politics have also become more stratified, reflecting the hostilities of Trump-era populism. Food, shopping, and entertainment preferences are polarized by social class. In all these areas of culture, the rich and the rest inhabit separate worlds. 

- Michael Harrington's 1962 book The Other America documented the widespread poverty in the U.S. amid growing affluence. He estimated that about a quarter of Americans lived in poverty.

- Harrington and others sought to convey the human suffering involved. They provided details on how little the poor could afford and consume.  

- Harrington's book helped inspire the Kennedy and Johnson administrations to launch the War on Poverty. The War on Poverty led to a major reduction in poverty. By official measures, the poverty rate fell from 22.4% in 1959 to 11.1% in 1973. By other measures, poverty fell even more substantially. 

- The poor today have much higher living standards. They can afford more goods like air conditioners, dishwashers, and cars. They also have much more leisure time. Measures of health and lifespan have also improved substantially among the poor.

- However, poverty remains a serious problem. The War on Poverty stalled, poverty has worsened recently, and inequality has risen. But the early gains from the War on Poverty have endured. Poverty today remains far lower than in the 1960s by most measures.

- In sum, while poverty persists, living standards among the poor have risen substantially thanks to the legacy of the War on Poverty. But continued progress is still needed. 

- The profits earned by elite professionals like doctors, lawyers, and financiers far exceed $400,000 per year. Along with specialists like doctors, this group likely comprises about 1 million people who are in the top 1% of income earners. 

- Critics argue that inequality arises from the rich accumulating capital and exploiting labor. However, an examination of elite incomes shows that they now predominantly come from high-paying jobs, not returns on capital. The rich accumulate wealth through hard work and skill, not by being idle rentiers.

- The majority of the wealthiest Americans today earned their fortunes through work, not inheritance. Over 70% of the Forbes 400 richest Americans are self-made, compared to only 40% in the early 1980s. The share of income the rich get from salaries has increased by 50% since 1961. The rich today make their money in labor-intensive fields like finance, not capital-intensive manufacturing.

- Top executives, managers, doctors, lawyers, and financiers earn high incomes from their labor, not from owning capital. Hedge fund managers, CEOs, and other elite professionals earn millions per year in wages and bonuses, not returns on investment. They are winning in the “war between talent and capital.”

- Data on tax returns shows the richest Americans today earn a far greater share of their income from labor, not capital, compared to earlier decades. Even using methods that misclassify some labor income as capital gains, the top 1% and 0.1% earned half their income from labor in 2000, up from a quarter in earlier decades. Accounting for income from entrepreneurship, stock options, and other sources shows an even greater increase in the labor share.

- In sum, while the rich today are far wealthier than in the past, they accumulate that wealth through hard work and high pay, not by being idle rentiers. Their fortunes reflect merit, not the exploitation of labor emphasized in conventional narratives of inequality. The conflict driving inequality today is within the labor market, between elite professionals and ordinary workers, not between labor and capital. 

- Elites in the U.S., regardless of political party, tend to be socially progressive but economically conservative. Studies show the wealthy hold more liberal views on social issues like homosexuality and abortion but more conservative views on economic issues like taxation, regulation, and welfare.

- The attitudes of the truly wealthy, the top 1%, are particularly economically conservative. Surveys show they are much less supportive of policies meant to help the working class, like increasing the minimum wage or expanding the welfare state. They are also much more opposed to increased regulation of businesses. The very richest tend to be the most economically conservative.  

- The economic elite has an ideology that combines progressive social values with free-market capitalism. They believe in meritocracy, individual responsibility, and oppose redistribution. This worldview unites elites across partisan lines and explains their disdain for populists like Donald Trump.

- The lifestyles and habits of the wealthy also differ from those of the middle and working class. The rich spend less time in leisure and more time exercising. They socialize more with friends and less with family. They have broad but shallow social networks that cater to a “cosmopolitan” self, unlike the deep, rooted networks of the middle class. Even their conversations, cooking, and hobbies are distinct.

- In sum, there are deep divisions between the attitudes, ideologies, and lifestyles of the economic elite and the rest of the population. These divisions reflect the greater appeal of free markets and meritocracy to the affluent. They shape how the rich and the rest understand the world in fundamentally different ways. Here is a summary of the key points from your conversation:

- Inequality would likely stay the same or worsen without major policy changes.

- Frontline managers and "an unwavering commitment" to women's careers are key to improving gender inequality.   

- Income transfers from rich to poor are needed to remedy inequality but often face political obstacles.
   
- Only catastrophic events like war, revolution or collapse have historically reduced inequality in a major way.  
     
- The postwar decades show that policy choices can build a robust middle class and greater equality.

- Inequality's effects impact society as a whole, not just the disadvantaged.  

- Education reform should focus on closing gaps at the top, not just the bottom.   

- Including merit-based inheritances in estate taxes could help curb inequality.   

- Rich universities get far more public subsidies than poor colleges but act like "hedge funds with schools attached."  

- University endowments have grown much faster than household incomes.  

- Public universities get less government funding per student than elite private schools. 

- The word "meritocracy" was coined in 1958 by British sociologist Michael Young. He used it in a dystopian satire to warn against the dangers of a society that allocates advantages based solely on merit or ability. 

- Young worried that meritocracy would produce a rigid class system based on ability and merit. He thought this would ultimately lead to social unrest and violence. However, Young's warnings were largely unheeded and the concept of meritocracy became widely embraced.

- Young underestimated how profoundly meritocracy would transform society. It has reshaped values and ideals about equality, justice, and merit. Meritocracy now seems necessary and inevitable. This makes the problems of meritocracy, like inequality, hard to address. 

- To critique meritocracy, we need new norms and frames of reference suited to the meritocratic world. Although Young's original arguments fall short, his work helps point the way. The analogy between meritocracy and aristocracy is particularly illuminating.

- Like aristocracy, meritocracy isolates an elite class that passes on its advantages across generations. Meritocratic education and jobs create feedback loops that entrench the privilege of the elite. Although aristocracy was based on land and meritocracy is based on human capital, both allow elites to effectively inherit their status.

- Meritocracy has adapted the aristocratic impulse to today's world, where wealth depends on human capital, not land. Meritocratic education and elite training help pass status between generations. Laws around debt, inheritance, and education subsidize the transfer of advantage. Meritocracy reconstructs aristocratic privilege for the modern age, though perhaps in a less stable form.

- In summary, meritocracy resembles aristocracy in its dynastic nature and entrenchment of elite privilege. Recognizing this helps clarify why meritocracy leads to inequality and illuminates how we might escape the "meritocracy trap." 

- St. Clair Shores, Michigan, is a predominantly white, middle-class suburb of Detroit with higher rates of high school graduates and lower rates of college graduates compared to the U.S. average. 
- Highly educated populations are increasingly concentrated in large cities and affluent communities. About a quarter of the world's most educated people live in the 100 largest cities.
- There is a growing geographic segregation in the U.S. along lines of education and income. The college-educated and affluent are clustering in certain elite ZIP codes and cities. 
- There were also historical restrictions that prevented racial minorities and low-income groups from moving to more affluent, higher-opportunity areas. Although some of these restrictions have been lifted, barriers to mobility remain. 
- The increased segregation threatens social cohesion and democratic responsiveness. There is a risk of having "two nations" - one privileged and one deprived. The latter feel increasingly vulnerable and insecure. 
- Economic inequality has been rising in the U.S., with the top 1% gaining the vast majority of income growth since the 1970s. The bottom 75% of Americans have seen little if any income growth.
- The affluent have disproportionate influence over politics through campaign contributions and lobbying. The richest 1% contribute over half of campaign contributions. Corporate lobbying has also expanded dramatically, with spending exceeding $3 billion. This threatens the principle of equal responsiveness in a democracy.

In summary, rising income inequality and socioeconomic segregation pose risks to social cohesion and democratic values in America. The wealthy have disproportionate influence over politics, while large portions of the population feel increasingly economically vulnerable and politically alienated. Here is a summary of the categories studied by Aguiar and Bils:

1. Education expenditures: By 2008-2010, education expenditures became the single largest income elastic expenditure category, meaning that higher-income households spent a disproportionately large share of their income on education. 

2. Meritocracy in college admissions: Although students from low-income families have shown gains in measures used for college admissions, higher-income students have shown even greater gains. As a result, enrollment in selective colleges has become disproportionately made up of wealthier students. For example, in 2013 only 17% of students with top SAT/ACT scores and GPAs came from the poorest families. About a quarter of students at top schools come from families in the top 1% of income.

3. Inheritance of privilege: There is a high degree of correlation between the socioeconomic status of parents and their children in the US. The "skills gap" between children of college-educated parents and high school dropouts is 50% higher in the US than other OECD countries. This shows how privilege and status are inherited over generations.

4. Dynasties: Like the aristocracies of old, the wealthy classes in the US today are able to pass on their privilege to their descendants, enabling the creation of dynasties. Legal mechanisms like restricting the sale of human capital, similar to how aristocrats entailed land, help facilitate this.

5. Changes to the family: Meritocracy is remaking the family into a "site of production" where children are developed and cultivated to preserve and enhance family status over generations. This is similar to the role of aristocratic families in the past. 

6.College admissions: Elite high schools like New York's Hunter College High School are dominated by children of privilege, with up to 10 times more applicants than available spots. Admission depends heavily on performance on a single high-stakes test, disadvantaging those without access to test preparation. This system favors the already privileged.

In summary, the authors argue that categories like education, college admissions, inheritance, dynasties, families, and elite education have become mechanisms by which the privileged classes maintain and amplify their status over generations. This undermines equal opportunity and social mobility in US society. 

- There is a tension between the ideals of equality of opportunity and equality of outcome. Philosophers recognize that these ideals can come apart. 

- The phrase “slow, devastating decline” suggests a gradual worsening of some condition, like Philip Larkin’s metaphor of life as “an unbeatable slow machine that brings what you’ll get.”

- The U.S. Constitution specifies age requirements for elected offices like the presidency based on the view that more advanced age brings greater wisdom and stability. The framers worried about dynasties and wanted officials with life experience.

- A 2015 report on the Yale Law Journal described the journal’s selection process as reflecting “collective frenzy” and “collective anxiety.”

- Donald Trump’s inaugural address described “this American carnage” and appealed to “the forgotten men and women.” Polls found these themes resonated more with whites without a college degree.

- Views on major institutions like universities have become highly polarized along partisan lines. Some see them as bad for America. 

- The idea of “two Americas”—one for the rich and one for everyone else—has been a theme of progressive politicians and captures growing economic inequality. The social scientist Charles Murray’s book Coming Apart argues society is fracturing along class lines.

- Life expectancy fell in industrializing English parishes in the 1830s and 1840s to levels “not seen since the Black Death.”  

- In the early 19th century, the British working class faced very long work hours, up to 64 hours a week.  Americans worked over 50 hours a week in the early 20th century. The elite viewed physical labor with disdain. Though work hours have declined, jobs require more education and provide less leisure than in the past.

- Top jobs now commonly pay $500,000 to $100 million or more per year. A dominant path to wealth is through schooling and professional jobs, not physical labor or business ownership.  

- “Meritocracy” originally referred to a dystopian system where an intellectual elite dominated society. Now it refers to a system where talent and effort determine success. The “superordinate working class” consists of professionals who view long work hours as a “badge of honor.”

- Admission to top law schools like Yale is highly competitive and based heavily on college GPA and LSAT scores. About 80-85% of students accepted to Yale Law School enroll. 

- Luxury goods and services that were once aimed at the middle class are now exclusively for the wealthy. Prices of luxury items have increased dramatically. A middle-class person today likely cannot afford a luxury brand like Bentley or dine at an upscale restaurant. 

- The luxury market has expanded into new areas like healthcare, education, and experiences. There are now things like luxury dentists, hospitals, and schools that cater to the wealthy. Ticket prices for entertainment and events have also skyrocketed. 

- These trends are reinforcing each other and leading to greater segregation between the rich and the rest of society. The rich and middle class shop at different stores, eat at different restaurants, and send their kids to different schools. They even pay for things differently, with the wealthy using their income and savings rather than taking on debt.

- In the mid-20th century, most Americans lived in mixed-income communities. Neighborhoods were defined more by culture and history than economics. Income levels across the country were also converging. Today, places are increasingly segregated by class. The wealthy cluster in elite communities with other high earners.

- In summary, the increasing concentration of wealth is transforming consumption and geography. There is a fracturing into distinct realms for the rich and everyone else in terms of schools, healthcare, stores, restaurants, entertainment, and communities. Economic segregation appears to be rising in tandem with inequality of incomes and wealth. 

- The data indicate a correlation between parents’ income and children’s skills in literacy and math, though OECD has not published data directly on the effect of income on math skills.  

- There is a long-term trend of decreasing odds that children will earn more than their parents.

- The average age of first birth for women, life expectancy, returns on investments in the stock market, and economic growth have all increased over time.

- The data on these socioeconomic trends come from academic studies by Raj Chetty, the Yale economist Robert Shiller, Dimensional Fund Advisors, and others. 

- The Spirit of the Laws by Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu, analyzed different types of governments and legal systems. It helped establish the separation of powers theory that influenced the U.S. Constitution.

- The court culture in Renaissance-era Europe emphasized etiquette, manners, and performance over martial skills or athleticism. Castiglione’s The Book of the Courtier helped define this courtly ideal.

- In the 16th and 17th centuries, authors like Cervantes and Molière satirized the hypocrisy and ridiculousness of chivalry and courtly manners. They skewered the vanity and greed of the aristocracy.

- The “third-generation Yale man” represented the embedded privilege of elite U.S. institutions that were inaccessible to most. Aristocratic prep schools and colleges helped perpetuate the status of the upper class.

- The rise of standardized testing and meritocracy in the mid-20th century U.S. followed an earlier social revolution that dismantled aristocratic hierarchies. However, meritocracy created its own forms of inequality and unfairness. 

- Skills and talents are often dependent on the social frames and contexts that produce them. They do not exist in isolation. Meritocratic skills suit a particular set of social and economic conditions but do not necessarily benefit society as a whole.

- There are various proposed ways to measure the social value or productivity of high-paying meritocratic jobs, such as how much the economy would suffer without them or how their pay compares to median income. On most measures, these jobs do not seem to provide benefits that match their high compensation.

- To counter the negative effects of meritocracy, some proposals include: promoting well-being over constant achievement; rebalancing life ambitions away from money, status, and long work hours; and reforming elite education to emphasize ethics, caring for others, and cooperation over competition. Finding purpose and meaning can help alleviate feelings of inadequacy and endless striving. Here is a summary of the report:

- College enrollment rates have nearly doubled since 1970, but inequality in access to higher education has also grown. In 1970, students from the top income quartile were three times more likely to earn a BA than those from the bottom quartile. Now, they are six times more likely. 

- Students from the top income quartile are overrepresented at elite colleges by a ratio of 14 to 1 compared to students from the bottom quartile. At some of the most selective colleges, over 80% of students come from the top income quartile.

- The gap in college access between rich and poor students grew substantially between the early 1980s and 2000s. In the early 1980s, students from the top income quartile were 31 percentage points more likely to complete college by age 24 than those from the bottom quartile. By the early 2000s, that gap had grown to 45 percentage points.

- A very small number of elite colleges enroll more students from the top 1% of the income distribution than the entire bottom 60% combined. At Harvard and Yale, the ratio of students from the top to bottom income quintiles is about 3.5 to 1. Over half of Harvard and Yale students come from families making over $125,000 per year, while only about 15% come from families making under $40,000.

- The increased inequality in access to higher education, especially at elite colleges, undermines the American ideal of college as an "engine of opportunity" that promotes social mobility. While college enrollment has risen overall, the outsized gains at selective colleges for affluent students have exacerbated inequality.

In summary, the report shows that while college-going has increased over time, the benefits have accrued disproportionately to affluent students, especially at the most elite colleges. This trend poses a threat to equal opportunity and intergenerational mobility in American society. 

The middle class holds political power and access in a democracy but failed to act against the narrowing elite that burdened them. This was because meritocracy legitimized rising inequality. People felt those who worked hard deserved more rewards. The rich argued for lower taxes, and others accepted this. Meritocracy emboldened critics of redistribution, who said it just reflected resentment of the industrious. 

The elite prep school Groton once admitted nearly all applicants and valued family privilege. Elite colleges shared this view. They admitted most applicants and favored alumni families. Students from top families dominated but performed poorly.

Reformers promoted meritocracy and tools like the SAT to diversify elite education. Starting at Harvard, competitive admission and testing disrupted the old elite. Meritocratic ideals of talent and human capital investment spread.

Yale was slower to change but transformed under Kingman Brewster. Meritocracy guided Brewster’s reforms. Admissions director Inslee Clark rejected the old elite and sought “talent” to benefit most from Yale. They cut prep school admits and boosted diversity. The changes were quick and dramatic.

So in summary, meritocracy enabled the narrowing elite by legitimizing inequality. But meritocracy also inspired reforms to diversify elite education. Reformers used meritocratic tools and ideals to dismantle the old hereditary elite at places like Harvard and Yale. Here is a summary of the institutions and events mentioned:

The author acknowledged research assistance from students at Yale Law School and research support from the Yale Law Library.

The author's agents and editors also provided support in developing and improving the book. Here is a summary of the key points:

- New York City public schools have become more selective and less diverse. The schools admit fewer black and Hispanic students. The schools frequently change leadership. They have reduced homework to relieve student stress. 

-Students value elite education for the status and connections it signifies. Their demand for such education does not satiate. Elite education is a “positional good”—something people value largely based on how much of it they have compared to others.

-There is a continuum from ordinary goods to positional goods to luxury goods. Demand for the latter two categories remains steady or rises with income rather than declining as people acquire more of the goods. Education lies toward the positional end of the continuum.  

-Many elite college students experience anxiety, depression, and lack of purpose. Some critics argue elite schools produce “zombies,” “excellent sheep,” and “gutless, mercenary” graduates. Others argue such schools still provide opportunity.

-People now spend more of their careers navigating job changes, many unplanned or unwanted. Mid-20th-century career paths were more stable and linear. CEOs had more control and job security.

-Technological change and globalization have polarized the labor market into high-skill, high-wage work and low-skill, low-wage work. Routine jobs have declined. Most new jobs are at the high and low ends of the wage and skill distribution.

-McDonald’s provides an example of job polarization. Entry-level jobs there were once a means of advancement but are now increasingly automated or outsourced. Top executives were once promoted from within but are now more often external hires with elite credentials. McDonald’s Hamburger University trained employees in company operations but now focuses on new franchise owners.

-In summary, the case studies point to more instability and angst in careers and education. They show a separation of the elite from the mainstream on the basis of access to positional goods like elite schooling. And they show a polarized and precarious labor market in which the spoils increasingly go to those at the top and the bottom rather than the middle. 
- The post-WWII era saw rising affluence and growth of the middle class. Prosperity was widely shared, with median incomes nearly doubling between the 1940s and 1960s. Even those not in the elite were likely to surpass their parents’ economic status. This prosperity shaped culture and physical infrastructure like suburbs. 

- However, today meritocracy has negatively impacted the middle class. While the middle class today may be richer in absolute terms due to economic growth, they are worse off relative to the mid-20th century in other ways. Their world is stagnant, depleted, and shrinking. They have also declined in cultural importance and economic centrality.

- The town of St. Clair Shores illustrates this. Though not deprived, the median income there matches the national average. However, good jobs are scarce. The prosperous “privileged working class” of the post-WWII era, making the equivalent of $100,000 today, has disappeared. The 27-story Shore Club Highrise Apartments, built in 1962, symbolizes the former affluence but now struggles with vacancies.

- Meritocracy has made getting ahead increasingly difficult for the middle class. Top universities and jobs go to those with high test scores, grades, and achievements, which are strongly correlated with family income and resources. The meritocratic elite is disproportionately wealthy, and they use their advantages to prepare their children to also join the elite, creating self-perpetuating inequality.

- Though the meritocratic elite see themselves as deserving of their status, their success actually stems largely from unearned advantages like family resources, connections, relationships, and opportunities - not from being inherently more meritorious. Meritocracy ends up promoting class divides and inequality rather than opportunity.

- In a meritocracy, the elite benefit while the middle class struggles. The system is set up for the success of the elite at the expense of the middle class. Though the harms of meritocracy are unintended, its inner logic makes inequality and lack of opportunity inevitable outcomes.

So in summary, while post-WWII America saw a thriving and growing middle class, today meritocracy has depleted and marginalized the middle class. The system favors the elite, making social mobility increasingly difficult for the middle class. Though the harms of meritocracy are unintentional, they are built into how the system operates. Meritocracy ends up exacerbating inequality rather than providing opportunity. 

Materially and morally, meritocracy has weakened the state and empowered private elites. Historically, the state held a monopoly on force and public virtue while private elites dominated the economy. This division of power enabled the state to govern effectively. Now, the state and private elites directly compete for the most valuable human capital and virtues. Like medieval kings, today’s governments struggle against the influence of private wealth. 

Meritocracy distorts politics and civic values. It allows elites to dominate politics rather than serve citizens equally. Elites become complacent and detached while others grow resentful. Elites condemn prejudice but ignore other vices and show contempt for the middle and working classes. Meanwhile, the middle class embraces nativism and populism in response to their exclusion and wounded dignity.

Meritocracy deprives non-elites of an oppressor to blame and stokes resentment of minorities. It frames inequality as justified but leaves many feeling rejected and shamed. Nativism numbs the pain of social and economic exclusion. Populism lashes out at establishment institutions that confer merit and benefits on elites.

In summary, meritocracy has made elites arrogant and society polarized. It weakens the state, empowers private wealth, distorts politics, and spreads moral corruption. A system meant to reward ability and effort has generated nativism, populism, complacency, and contempt. 

Meritocracy produces intense inequality through a cycle of elite education and high-paying jobs. The elite are highly skilled and productive, but they also shape the economy to favor their skills, creating a narrow set of high-paying jobs and high incomes for themselves. This results in unprecedented levels of inequality, especially in the U.S. 

While meritocracy began by replacing aristocracy, it has become an aristocracy of its own that is hard to criticize. Meritocracy seems fair because it rewards effort and talent. It also produces economic growth by enabling the elite to be enormously productive. However, the inequality it produces is now greater than in many developing countries.

Critics argue this inequality shows meritocracy has failed, and success is really due to nepotism, social connections, or wealth. They say schools and employers favor the privileged, and the elite make money through fraud or rent-seeking. Others blame rising inequality on income shifting from labor to capital. 

These critics accept meritocracy’s ideals, just arguing it has failed to live up to them. It is hard to condemn inequality without seeming envious or complacent. Blaming failures of meritocracy makes the argument against inequality seem morally serious. However, meritocracy itself produces the inequality, through a self-perpetuating cycle of elite education and jobs.

Meritocracy has become common sense and inevitable, disguising its own contingency. It limits critical thinking about inequality and alternatives. Economic inequality and meritocratic ideology fuel each other, like an immune system producing ever more resistant parasites. Meritocracy has assumed the tyranny of “no alternatives.”

In summary, meritocracy produces and obscures massive inequality through a self-reinforcing system of elite education and work. It has become nearly impossible to critique, though it is neither natural nor just. Arguments against inequality largely accept meritocracy, just alleging it has failed. However, meritocracy itself is the root cause of inequality. It limits imagining alternative systems. 

- Jobs have polarized into high-skilled, high-paying jobs and low-skilled, low-paying jobs. Mid-skilled, middle-class jobs have declined. 

- 25% of mid-skilled jobs have disappeared since 1980. High-skilled jobs have increased by 1/3. The professional workforce has more than doubled.

- This trend is seen across developed nations. Low- and high-wage jobs grew in the 2000s and 2010s while mid-wage jobs declined. Mid-wage jobs suffered most in the recession. Future job growth is predicted to be in low- and high-wage jobs.

- This represents a sea change in the labor market and economy. Work used to support a large middle class but now divides society into the rich and the rest. The old democratic, unionized workforce has been replaced by a polarized, meritocratic one.

- The new meritocratic system favors the elite, who can provide elite educations for their children. Children from rich families are far more likely to end up in high-income, high-education brackets.

- Education is now the main sorting mechanism in the labor market. It maps strongly onto income, with little overlap between levels. The income and wealth gaps between levels of education are huge. The college wage premium and returns to elite degrees have skyrocketed.

- At the top levels, the gaps are even bigger. Graduates of elite schools, especially professional schools, make vastly more. Law school and business school graduates from top schools, especially, make many times more than average. This fuels massive inequality even within the elite professions.

- In summary, the new meritocratic system and polarization of work has led to a gulf between the rich, highly educated elite and the rest in terms of jobs, income, and opportunity. The elite are able to perpetuate their status, while upward mobility for the rest is limited. Here's a summary:

- Safeway's motto in the postwar era was "Drive the Safeway; Buy the Safeway" to convey quality, selection, and value. 
- Safeway had a simple business formula focused on high volume, low prices, and low operating costs. It avoided firing employees.
- In the 1970s, Safeway began programs to hire underprivileged minority workers and became more socially responsive.
- Safeway's CEO in 1965, Robert Magowan, worked his way up from a bakery helper. His pay was half the average CEO's but high for the era.
- Corporations increasingly financed operations through debt rather than profits or equity in the postwar era. They disbursed funds via buybacks and dividends rather than wage increases or reinvestment.
- The "shareholder revolution" began in the 1970s. It advocated maximizing shareholder value over other stakeholders' interests. Leveraged buyouts and activist investors pressured managers.
- The M&A wave of the 1980s led companies to adopt anti-takeover defenses. Private equity's rise allowed shareholders to target inefficient managers. 
- The shareholder revolution changed corporate culture. Midcentury managers supported civic life and good wages. Now managers focus on share price, and most workers aren't directly incentivized to boost it.
- CEO pay has shifted from fixed to equity pay, especially stock options, tying pay to share performance. Non-equity pay has barely risen, but equity pay has tripled.

So in summary, corporations increasingly financed themselves through debt, distributed more funds to shareholders over workers, faced pressure from activists to maximize shareholder value, changed their culture and practices in response, and tied CEO pay more closely to share performance. 

The flattening of corporate hierarchies and removal of middle managers that began in the 1980s was enabled by the rise of super-skilled workers, especially elite-educated managers and consultants. These workers developed and implemented managerial innovations that eliminated middle-management positions.

In the post-World War II era, innovation was thought to favor mid-skilled labor and equality. However, in recent decades, a rising supply of elite-educated, super-skilled workers has driven innovation in directions that favor skill and promote inequality. In particular, financial and managerial innovation has stripped power and incomes from ordinary workers and concentrated them at the top. 

Innovation tends to suit the interests and opportunities of innovators, who work within a social context. The supply of super-skilled labor has led innovators to develop technologies and techniques that benefit these workers, rather than mid-skilled labor. For example, elite consultants promoted reengineering and other processes that eliminated middle managers. Likewise, new financial techniques and metrics allowed top executives to gain huge windfalls while cutting average wages and employment.

In sum, the direction of innovation depends on the interests and opportunities of innovators, which are shaped by the conditions of the era. The rise of meritocratic education and super-skilled labor has driven a turn in innovation that favors skill and inequality over the mid-skilled labor that earlier innovation supported. Innovation is not an exogenous or disinterested process but rather is endogenously shaped to benefit dominant interests. 

- Elites today go through rigorous education and training to gain entry into elite professions. This was not the case for traditional elites like aristocrats. Elite degrees and jobs today require an intensity of work and competition unknown in the past. 

- Elite work today dominates the economy in a way that was not the case in the mid-20th century. At that time, mid-skilled labor dominated most sectors of the economy, from manufacturing to retail to finance. Today, technology and innovation have allowed elite workers to displace many mid-skilled jobs. Elite workers now have the skills and motivation to attract economic opportunity and dominate many industries.

- As an example, elite lawyers today work many more hours and have higher incomes than in the past. In 1962, lawyers worked around 1300 billable hours per year. Today, major law firms require 2400 billable hours per year or more. Lawyers at top firms often work 60-100 hour weeks. Similar trends are seen for elite finance workers and managers, who work far longer hours today than in the past. 

- The long working hours required of elites today would have been seen as degrading by elites of the past. But today, elite workers publicize and valorize their long, intense working hours as a badge of status and honor. Busyness has become a sign of being valued and needed.  

- Elite jobs today provide very high incomes. Top lawyers, doctors, finance workers, consultants, and managers commonly make several hundred thousand dollars a year, and often much more. The highest earners, like top hedge fund managers, can make hundreds of millions of dollars per year. The economic returns to elite education have skyrocketed.

- In many industries, middle-class employment has declined or become segregated between a small elite and a larger subordinate class. Innovation and technology have allowed elite workers to dominate, reducing opportunities for mid-skilled labor. Some displaced mid-skilled workers end up in “gloomy jobs” with little opportunity, while elite workers have “glossy jobs.”

In summary, elites today are highly educated and trained, work intensely long hours, dominate the economy, and as a result receive very high incomes. Their rise has displaced many mid-skilled, middle-class workers. A meritocratic elite has emerged that is capable and industrious in ways unknown in the past. Here's a summary:

- Mid-20th century management in the U.S. was broadly democratic, with executives, middle managers, and workers sharing responsibilities and rewards. Strong unions also gave workers more power and pay.

- Starting in the late 1970s, management became more concentrated at the top. New technologies gave executives more power to monitor and direct workers. Middle management declined, as executives could oversee workers directly. 

- Firms "downsized" middle management, cutting managerial jobs at nearly twice the rate of other jobs. Lifetime careers and full-time jobs gave way to short-term and part-time work with less responsibility. Some workers returned as contractors, replacing management.

- New firms were built around subcontracting, with few actual employees. Some firms contract out nearly all functions. In extreme cases, technologies reduce the distinction between employees and subcontractors, with workers selling outputs rather than labor.

- Top managers now have elite educations and training. Middle managers have been replaced by management consultants. Management has become concentrated in a small executive elite, separated from workers by kind, not just degree.

- The technologies enabling this concentration of power are complex, requiring intensive training. Only highly trained elites can implement them to coordinate production without traditional middle management.

So in summary, technology and ideology have enabled a concentration of managerial power and responsibility in a small executive elite. Middle management and worker autonomy have declined, contributing to inequality. 

- The availability of fossil fuels and the ability to dispose of their byproducts have strongly influenced industrial technologies and economic growth. For example, the internal combustion engine dominated over electric alternatives in the 20th century but electric vehicles are making a comeback in the 21st century. 

- The sources of wealth in industrialized countries have shifted from land and other physical capital to human capital over the past few centuries. However, some analyses of historical wealth exclude the value of human capital and focus only on physical and financial capital. 

- The populations of major industrial cities in Britain grew rapidly between 1811 and 1911. For example, London’s population grew from about 1 million to over 7 million, Manchester’s from under 100,000 to over 2.5 million, Birmingham’s from 71,000 to nearly 900,000, and Liverpool’s from 77,000 to over 700,000.

- Technological changes have tended to favor high-skilled workers who can perform complex, non-routine cognitive tasks. Low- and medium-skilled workers have been displaced from many of the jobs they once held. 

- The increasing complexity of business regulations and global trade regimes has increased the demand for high-skilled professionals and managers in both private companies and government agencies.

- Technological advancements build on each other and interact in ways that amplify their effects. This can result in high-skilled labor becoming even more valuable. 

- In the early 20th century, new labor regulations covered low- and medium-skilled workers but exempted high-skilled managers and professionals. This reinforced the rise of elite norms that set elite workers apart.

- The rapid expansion of higher education in the mid-20th century led to an oversupply of college-educated workers that reduced their wages. However, companies responded by developing new technologies that increased the demand for high-skilled labor. This caused the wage premium for college degrees to start rising again in the 1970s and 1980s.

- The incomes of top earners have also grown substantially since the 1970s. For example, the share of total income going to the top 1% of earners in the U.S. rose from about 8% in the 1970s to over 20% today. Much of this increase has come from rising high-skill wages rather than capital gains.

- The increase in elite wages was an unintended consequence of increasing access to higher education. This parallels earlier increases in high school wages that followed the expansion of public high schools. In both cases, new supplies of skilled labor drove innovations that then increased the demand for those skills. 

The average Palo Alto High School student scored in the 90th percentile 
nationally on standardized tests. Admission rates to top colleges like Stanford were 
4-5 times the national average. However, students also reported higher rates of drug
use, depression, and suicide. Studies show privileged youth may face higher rates of 
anxiety, depression, and substance abuse.

College students today report anxiety, depression, and "demoralization" at twice the
rate of 2000. Demands for excellence and the "pressure of perfection" contribute to 
these problems. People in other high-prestige, high-pressure jobs like banking, law, 
and tech also report extreme work hours, burnout, and health issues.

For example, Amazon's corporate culture emphasizes constant competition and 
 criticism to "deliver results." According to reports, "nearly every person" cried at 
work and burnout was common. Defenders argue Amazon's culture is not unique and 
high-performance workplaces necessarily involve stress. However, burnout  pervades elite workplaces, with executives reporting symptoms like "hitting the wall."

In summary, evidence suggests privileged youth and workers in prestigious high-
pressure jobs may face higher risks of mental health issues, stress, and burnout. A 
culture of relentlessly striving for excellence and perfection appears partly responsible. 

- In the 1960s, Yale University admitted students with much lower SAT scores in order to diversify its student body. This decision was controversial but helped change admissions practices at other elite universities. 

- Today, top universities like Yale, Harvard, and Princeton admit students who score above the 99th percentile on the SAT. These schools admit very few applicants, in some cases fewer than 5 percent.

- The United States has a large gap between its most and least educated citizens. The difference in skills between Americans with a college degree and those without a high school diploma is much greater than in other developed nations.

- There is a "Matthew Effect" in education, where the most privileged students gain access to the best resources and opportunities, further advancing their advantages. Elite families are now much more likely to send their children to top colleges.

- Marriage patterns show increasing "assortative mating" in the U.S., where people tend to marry others with the same level of education. In 1960, only about 4 percent of married couples had both partners with a college degree. Today, that number is nearly 30 percent.

- Assortative mating contributes to income inequality, as high-earning men and women join their incomes through marriage at higher rates. They also tend to have children later in life.

- Out-of-wedlock birth rates have increased for all education levels since 1970 but much more dramatically for women without a college degree. Today, the majority of births to women without a bachelor's degree occur outside of marriage. Here is a summary of the Washington Post article from March 23, 2017:

The article examines research showing increased mortality and declining health among middle-aged white Americans, especially those without a college degree. Two Princeton economists found that white non-Hispanic Americans between the ages of 45 and 54 without a college degree were less healthy and had higher suicide and drug overdose death rates in 2015 compared with 1999. They call this rise in deaths "deaths of despair." 

The researchers attribute this despair to the decline of stable middle-income jobs for those with only a high school education. Competition for ever-scarcer high-status positions has increased stress and health issues. While other developed nations provide more social support for those struggling with job loss and economic hardship, the U.S. safety net is less comprehensive. Many in this demographic group face unemployment, chronic pain, and addiction without much help.

The article argues that as good jobs for less-educated Americans become scarcer and as the stigma of being unemployed rises, health declines and mortality increases. The U.S. economy and healthcare system are not addressing this sea of despair, requiring a policy response to meet both economic and healthcare needs. More social support could help curb the worrying rise in deaths from drugs, alcohol and suicide.

The key elements in this summary are the rise in mortality and decline in health for middle-aged white Americans without a college degree, the link to lack of stable job opportunities and economic hardship for this group, the comparative lack of an adequate social safety net in the U.S., and the call for policy responses to address both economic and healthcare needs. I apologize, but I do not have enough context to summarize the concept of "l investment elite childhood." Without more details about what this refers to, I cannot provide a useful summary. Here is a summary of Chapter 4:

- Income inequality in the U.S. has risen substantially since the mid-20th century. In 1965, CEOs earned about 20 times as much as average workers; today CEOs earn about 300 times as much. Doctors and lawyers also used to earn just 5-7 times as much as nurses and secretaries, respectively; today they earn 7-40 times as much. 
- The increasing pay of superordinate workers (CEOs, doctors, lawyers) relative to subordinates (average workers, nurses, secretaries) illustrates the trend of "exploding wages for superordinate workers." This trend has concentrated income gains at the top. 
- The widening income gap has slowed or reversed the growth of median incomes. Although the economy has grown substantially, a child born today has only a 50% chance of earning more than their parents, compared to over 90% for a child born in 1940. 
- The town of St. Clair Shores, MI illustrates the harms of inequality and "meritocracy." Although its median income matches the national average, most residents live in small houses and struggle to maintain middle-class status. The town emphasizes meritocracy through strict rules and committees, but this does little to address the underlying economic insecurity and difficulty of upward mobility.

In summary, Chapter 4 discusses how increasing inequality and a focus on meritocracy have made it more difficult for the middle class to maintain or improve their economic status. Income and wealth have concentrated at the top, while those in the middle increasingly struggle. 

- Meritocracy is a system where people are ranked and rewarded based on merit, usually measured by educational credentials and achievements. 

- While meritocracy is appealing in theory, in practice it leads to increasing inequality and class conflict. It concentrates income and status at the top, while excluding most people from opportunity.

- The elite and the middle class become locked in a "hostile embrace." The middle class resents the elite for commandeering opportunities and status. The elite look down on the middle class but also feel insecure in their own position. 

- These resentments and anxieties have major social impacts. They fueled the rise of Donald Trump, who tapped into anger against meritocratic elites and institutions. They cause the elite to become arrogant yet insecure, clinging to whatever reinforces their superior status.

- Though the elite and middle class seem to inhabit "separate worlds," they are actually caught in the same "meritocracy trap." Their burdens arise from the same system that ruthlessly excludes most people while damaging the few who succeed. 

- The system generates unprecedented frustration and anxiety. Though meritocracy appears to reward ability and effort, in reality it leads to a rigid class hierarchy that harms society as a whole.

- The book aims to show how people across classes can recognize their common experience living under such a system. Though the charisma of meritocracy obscures its effects, its discontents unite the population in a shared predicament. The book chronicles how meritocracy damages lives to help readers understand its evils.

In summary, the key argument is that meritocracy ironically undermines the American Dream by concentrating opportunity and status at the top while excluding most people. It binds society in class conflict and mutual harm, even as it promotes an ideal of progress and justice. 

The government influences the economy in many ways, including regulating health care, law, finance, and corporate governance. These regulations shape what jobs exist and how much workers in those industries are paid. Reforming regulations to promote mid-level jobs could help reduce inequality. 

There are examples of reforms promoting mid-level jobs, like using nurse practitioners and physician assistants instead of doctors, using paralegals instead of lawyers for routine legal work, and limiting complex financial products in favor of traditional community banking. Policymakers should consider the impact of regulations and reforms on the distribution of jobs. A review process could help coordinate reforms to promote mid-level jobs.

The tax system also shapes the job market. The payroll tax, especially the cap on taxable income for Social Security, burdens mid-level workers more than the wealthy. Eliminating this cap would raise substantial revenue, reduce incentives for companies to replace mid-level jobs with high-paying jobs, and generate funds to further promote mid-level work.

The reforms would work together to counter forces driving inequality. Open access to education would increase opportunity and supply educated workers, putting downward pressure on high salaries. Reforming taxes and providing wage subsidies would make mid-level jobs more appealing to companies. This combination could be far more effective than either policy alone.

In summary, policy reforms aiming at health care, law, finance, education, taxes, and wage subsidies could significantly boost mid-level, middle-class jobs. Thoughtfully combining these reforms could reverse the trend toward inequality from a top and a bottom. 

- In the 1970s, Wall Street firms began hiring physicists, engineers and mathematicians to develop complex financial models and products. These "rocket scientists" enabled innovations that were previously theoretical, like options pricing models. 

- The influx of these highly-skilled workers drove significant changes in the finance industry. Banks moved away from traditional lending models that employed many mid-skilled workers. Instead, they developed securitized products and high-frequency trading platforms that required fewer but highly-skilled employees.

- The new models were very profitable, attracting more competition and spurring further innovation. The finance industry grew rapidly, but employed a smaller share of the total workforce. At the same time, wages in the industry skyrocketed, especially at the high end. The elite finance workers at the top became extremely wealthy.

- This trend exemplifies a broader pattern across the economy. The increasing demand for highly-skilled, college-educated workers leads to higher incomes for those at the top. Their high incomes and wealth in turn spur investments in education for their children. This cycle perpetuates and exacerbates economic inequality across generations. 

- The summary then provides the example of Safeway, a supermarket chain founded in the early 20th century. For decades, Safeway embraced a "midcentury model" that aimed to benefit producers, employees and consumers. But by the 1970s, this model gave way to one that favored the highly-skilled over the mid-skilled.

The key argument is that the increasing premium on high skills and advanced degrees has fueled a cycle of rising inequality in both income and opportunity. At the top, the highly-skilled are able to command much higher pay, while those in the middle face job insecurity and stagnant wages. Over time, this dynamic can seriously exacerbate inequality in society. 

The passage discusses the meritocratic regime of elite education and its dynastic effects. Meritocracy is supposed to promote social mobility and equal opportunity.  However, the regime of meritocratic education in practice sustains and even enhances the intergenerational  privilege of elite families.

There are several reasons for this:

1. Human capital (education and skills) is structured to resist dissipation across generations. Children do not inherit their parents’ debts and education is often paid for during childhood. This allows human capital to be passed down dynastically. 

2. Elite families gain nearly monopolistic control over pathways to high-status jobs and income.  They are able to pass down privilege through education and access to high-status work. 

3. The meritocratic system closely mirrors an aristocratic hereditary system. Education plays the role that breeding played in aristocracies. Access to elite professions plays the role that land ownership did.

4. The meritocratic system produces an “educational arms race” in which elites constantly try to outdo each other through lavish investments in education.  This benefits no one and causes immense stress, anxiety, and harm.

5. The meritocratic system leads to the exclusion and diminished opportunities of the poor and middle class. As elites gain greater control and invest more in education, others have less chance of upward mobility.

In summary, the passage argues that meritocracy has failed to achieve its promise of equal opportunity and social mobility. Instead, it has produced a dynastic, hereditary-like system of privilege through generationally perpetuated advantages in education and access to high-status work. This system creates enormous costs, harms, and inefficiencies. Overall, meritocracy has become a mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of privilege rather than a force for openness and fairness. 

- The share of employees in finance with a college degree rose from about 20% in 1980 to over 60% in 2006. At the same time, the share of compensation going to finance rose from about 5% to over 15% of GDP. A smaller, more educated elite came to dominate finance. 

- While finance grew more skill-intensive, other sectors like manufacturing became more routine-task intensive. Middle-skill, middle-wage jobs declined. Earnings grew much more for the college-educated, especially those with postgraduate degrees. The median worker earned little more in real terms between 1980 and 2010, while incomes soared for those at the top.

- As incomes stagnated for most Americans, consumption and debt levels rose sharply. Household debt as a share of disposable income rose from about 65% in 1980 to over 135% in 2007. Much of the additional consumption was fueled by borrowing against increasing housing values and rising debt. This amounted to an implicit “safety net” as income alone could not sustain consumption.

- The increasing reliance on debt to finance consumption mirrors the logic of payday lending and reflects the declining ability of wages alone to support a middle-class lifestyle. The model is unstable and contributed to the financial crisis. Americans consume at a level far beyond counterparts in other nations, facilitated by borrowing much of the world’s excess savings. 

- Education and skill are increasingly rewarded in the job market. Adults with tertiary-educated parents earn 31% more on average across OECD countries. They are also much more likely to work in high-skilled jobs. Unequal access to high-quality education has reinforced inequality. Reading skills strongly predict the ability to “participate in society” and access economic opportunity. 

- In summary, these trends show how financialization and inequality have interacted. A more skilled, highly paid financial elite emerged as income and opportunity polarized in the broader economy. Consumption was fueled not through wage gains for most but through debt. This model supported global demand but also crisis. Unequal access to education and high-reward skill sets has been central to the story. Policies promoting more equal opportunity and wage gains may help establish a more stable foundation for growth. 

- Today, wealthy parents invest heavily in their children's education and training to prepare them for high-paying jobs. This "meritocratic inheritance" has replaced passing down physical and financial wealth as the main way the elite upper class maintains its status across generations. 
- This meritocratic inheritance can be valued at around $10 million per child. It provides elite children with advantages that allow them to outcompete others, especially those from middle and lower-class backgrounds.
- Although meritocracy was originally meant to increase social mobility and opportunity, it now does the opposite. The meritocratic inheritance allows the wealthy elite to hoard opportunity and maintain their dynastic privilege. 
- Elite parents spend far more on their children's education compared to middle-class parents. This results in elite children systematically outperforming others at every stage of education. By the time they are adults, the elite is made up predominantly of people from elite families. 
- There are too few high-achieving students from non-elite backgrounds for them to make up a large portion of students at elite colleges. Even if more qualified students from middle and lower-class backgrounds attended elite schools (a concept known as "matching"), they would still be outnumbered by students from elite families.
- Elite colleges admit the vast majority of the highest-achieving students. The students who get into the most competitive colleges and postgraduate programs are overwhelmingly from elite, wealthy families. 
- Whereas inherited wealth can lead to its own squandering over generations, the meritocratic inheritance inspires the discipline needed to build and maintain human capital. Laws also prevent people from extracting value from their human capital without continuing to work and improve their skills.

In summary, the meritocratic inheritance has allowed the modern elite upper class to hoard opportunity, gain advantages over each generation, and maintain their privileged status in a way that undermines the promise of meritocracy and equal opportunity.  

In the 1960s, Kingman Brewster led an effort as president of Yale University to make admissions more merit-based and less biased towards candidates from elite backgrounds. In Yale’s first year of its new merit-based admissions policy, the share of admittees from alumni families dropped significantly. The new class of 1970 had many more public school students and far outperformed previous classes academically. 

The old elite opposed these changes, but meritocracy eventually prevailed. Elite colleges today are far more selective, admitting less than 10% of applicants on average. Students at top schools like Harvard and Yale now have extremely high SAT scores, with many above the 99th percentile.

The merit system has led to increasing inequality, however. The skills and opportunities gap between the most and least educated Americans is larger than in other developed countries. The elite can now pass their status to their children through education and opportunity in a “Matthew Effect.” Even before elite children are born, their parents make choices that benefit them. Elite, educated parents today are more likely to marry each other, creating a “multiplier” effect that increases inequality. They are also more likely to stay married, which provides major benefits to their children.

In summary, the move to merit-based college admissions initially increased opportunity and diversity. But it has led to a new self-perpetuating elite that can hoard and pass on advantage through strategic choices in education, marriage, and child-rearing. While the old aristocracy passed on privilege through birth, the new meritocracy reconstructs families and children to perpetuate dynasties of its own. Here is a summary of the key points:

- The difference in per-student spending between competitive colleges and noncompetitive colleges has grown dramatically over the past 50 years, from about $14,000 to about $80,000 (in constant dollars). This gap partly reflects the fact that competitive colleges must provide luxurious amenities to attract affluent students. 

- The rising cost of college has been disproportionately borne by poor students, not affluent students. At private colleges today, poor students pay only slightly more than half of what affluent students pay, compared to paying about half in 1999-2000.

- Historically, higher education was meant to signify one’s preparedness to take on leadership roles in society. Today, a college degree has become virtually required for most middle-class jobs. Graduate and professional schools have also become the primary path to the professions, though this was not always the case.

- Midcentury American firms typically hired workers with a high school degree or less and provided substantial on-the-job training. Today, companies provide little training and expect workers to arrive with the necessary skills, acquired through higher education. This transfer of training from the workplace to the school applies to both elite and non-elite workers.

- Economic mobility has declined in recent decades. It used to be common for people to rise “from the mail room to the corner office,” but today economic outcomes are increasingly determined by one’s educational attainment and family income.

In summary, higher education today plays a much larger role as a mechanism of both occupational selection and the intergenerational transmission of economic status. The rising cost of college, combined with its increasing necessity for most careers, means that access to higher education has a greater influence than ever before on one’s economic prospects. 

- The data on income and work hours shows a rising gap between the elite and non-elite. The trends are clear though the data is imperfect. Many other studies confirm this trend using different methods. 

- It is hard to calculate the consumption share of the top 1% due to data limitations. Some studies show only a modest rise in consumption inequality.

- The figure shows the ratio of high, middle and low incomes over time using post-tax incomes to capture people's true circumstances. 

- The Gini coefficients were calculated in three ways using post-tax incomes. Most studies show little rise in inequality for the bottom 99% of the population.

- The ratio of education expenditures by income and education levels are imperfect due to data limitations. But shorter, alternative data series validate the overall trend.

- Studies of achievement gaps by Sean Reardon show 90/50 gaps rising while 50/10 gaps held steady. Reardon had to adjust data from different tests to make them comparable, though the overall trends are robust.

- Data on the GDP share, employment share, and relative income and education of the finance sector show it gaining substantially compared to the rest of the private sector from 1947 to 2005. The series on relative education is scaled for visual comparison though the correlation is unaffected.

- In summary, the key trends are a rising divide between the affluent and the rest in incomes, work hours, consumption, education expenditures and achievement. The finance sector has gained disproportionately. Though data is imperfect, the overall trends are clear and confirmed by many studies. 

- Elite high schools send about 30% of their graduates to top colleges like Ivy League schools, Stanford, and MIT. These elite high schools enroll mostly students from wealthy families. 

- College attendance and graduation rates have increased for Americans overall since WWII, but the increases have been much greater for students from high-income families. Students from wealthy families are now much more likely to attend and graduate from college than middle-class and low-income students.

- Students from wealthy families disproportionately attend the most selective and prestigious colleges. At the most elite colleges, students from the top income quartile outnumber students from the bottom income quartile by 14 to 1. At the most competitive colleges, the ratio is 24 to 1.

- The disparities in college attendance and graduation between income groups have been growing over time. The gap between high-income and middle-income students is much larger than the gap between middle-income and low-income students.

- The student bodies at elite colleges are dominated by students from high-income families. At some of the most elite schools like Harvard and Yale, students from the top income quintile outnumber students from the bottom two quintiles by 3.5 to 1. At top schools like the Ivies, Stanford, MIT, and Duke, more students come from the top 1% of families than the entire bottom half of the income distribution.

- In summary, being born into a wealthy family is almost essential to getting into an elite college. College itself widens the gap in investment in human capital between high-income and middle-income people. Rich students receive massive investments in their education at elite colleges while most poor and middle-class students receive little investment beyond high school. Here is a summary of Ally Financial:

Ally Financial is the descendent of General Motors’ auto finance division, founded in 1919 as General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC). It grew rapidly during the postwar era, enabling increased consumption by financing auto and household loans. By 1970, GMAC held over $13 billion in auto finance assets. GMAC was a model of 20th-century finance, focused on originating and holding loans. 

In the 1980s and 1990s, GMAC transformed into an institution focused on securitizing and distributing financial assets. It began bundling and selling auto loans and mortgages to investors, freeing up capital to originate even more loans. This shift allowed GMAC to substantially increase lending and profits. By 2000, GMAC held over $150 billion in assets. But distributing loans also disconnected GMAC from the ultimate performance and risk of those loans.

The financial crisis of 2008 hit GMAC hard. Its residential mortgage arm, Residential Capital, collapsed and filed for bankruptcy in 2012. The US Treasury invested $17.2 billion to save GMAC during the crisis.

In response, GMAC restructured and rebranded as Ally Financial. It exited the mortgage business to focus on auto finance. Today, Ally is again growing rapidly, with $180 billion in assets, largely in auto loans and leases. About half of all US auto dealers work with Ally to finance their customers’ vehicle purchases.

Ally Financial’s history illustrates key themes in 20th-century finance. It shows the rise of automated consumer lending after World War II, the shift from originate-and-hold to originate-and-distribute models, the growth of shadow banking, and the high compensation attracted to the financial sector. Ally continues to demonstrate the ongoing centrality of finance to consumption. Overall, Ally Financial has been at the center of major trends that have shaped the development of modern finance in America. 

According to an open letter by Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, his intention in 
creating the company was to “advance human potential.” However, although Facebook may have enabled new forms 
of connection, its business model also relies on encouraging people to spend as much time as possible using the 
platform so that their attention and data can be sold to advertisers. This model contributes to the “busy 
culture”—the societal expectation that being constantly occupied and overworked is a virtue.

The culture of busyness is linked to perceptions of social status. Being busy is now seen as a “badge of honor” that 
signals someone is ambitious, hardworking, and successful. This was not always the case. In Thorstein Veblen’s time, 
leisure and conspicuous consumption were markers of high status. But there has been a “remarkable historical reversal” where busyness now confers status in a way that leisure once did. 

Elite professionals, especially, feel pressure to work extreme hours to signal their commitment and justify their high 
compensation. Investment bankers, lawyers, and managers often work 60- to 100-hour weeks and describe  themselves as “workaholics.” They “wear their commitments” like a “badge of honor,” even though overwork has damaging effects. 

The culture of busyness also serves managerial interests. When professionals internalize the idea that constant work is virtuous, it helps companies extract longer work hours without properly compensating employees. Professionals come to see overwork as a “fair trade” for high pay and status, even if it leads to poor health, lack of leisure, and family strain. In this way, busyness acts as a “disciplinary tool” to increase productivity.

The culture of busyness has spread throughout society but serves the interests of the corporate elite. While 
professionals sacrifice their time and well-being to overwork, the wealthy are able to enjoy lavish leisure. The spread of technologies like social media may accelerate expectations of constant availability and busyness for ordinary  people. There is a need to challenge these dynamics and reassess our societal attitudes toward work, leisure, and  status. Here is a summary of the passage:

- Meritocracy has increased economic inequality and transformed politics. Progressives have been slow to recognize these changes and populists have exploited them.

- Demagogues like Trump promise to restore a mythical golden age by attacking outsiders and the establishment. Others sell false solutions to the elite like work-life balance programs. But these are not real solutions. 

- Progressives can’t properly address these issues either. They dismiss middle class concerns as nostalgia and elite concerns as luxury. This drives the middle class to populists and the elite to ineffective solutions.

- Conventional views on reducing inequality see it as a competition where helping one group requires hurting another. This makes it hard to build political will and craft good policy. Most experts are pessimistic inequality can be reduced without catastrophe.

- However, the US did reduce inequality in the past with the New Deal. And the conventional view is mistaken. Progressives can address the concerns of both groups, who have a shared interest in reducing inequality. 

- Meritocracy has created a trap where the rich and middle class have separate discontents. But they can only escape together by dismantling meritocracy and building a democratic and equal social order that benefits everyone. 

- Progressives have fought for equality before and know that real equality elevates everyone. They now need to apply this to the economy and dismantle the meritocracy trap, bringing the rich and middle class together to flourish. This will require comprehensive changes to government, culture, and more - “the work of a civilization.”

The key arguments are that meritocracy has created a trap of inequality and separate discontents for the rich and middle class, but progressives can bring them together around their shared interests in real equality and democracy. Comprehensive reforms across society will be needed to accomplish this. 

- Students at elite high schools and colleges face immense pressure to achieve and this has led to high rates of anxiety, depression, and even suicide. The meritocracy has created an intense “competitive frenzy” surrounding admission to top schools that directly threatens students’ mental health. 

- The pressures of the meritocracy do not end after students graduate. Elites face similarly intense pressures in their jobs which lead to exhaustion, burnout, and health issues. Elite jobs require extraordinarily long hours and “relentlessly high standards.” Workers frequently break down crying at their desks or continue working through serious injuries and illnesses. 

- The material benefits of being part of the elite cannot overcome the psychological stresses and unhappiness that result from the meritocracy. Two-thirds of elite workers say they would turn down a promotion that required more of their time and energy. There are calls for better “work-life balance” but little substantive change.

- The burdens of the meritocracy are becoming intolerable even for elites. Like the Vietnam War turned public opinion against the draft, the costs of meritocratic inequality and competition are souring elites’ views. However, elites remain trapped in a cycle of earning higher salaries that require longer hours that then demand even higher pay. Meaningful reform has not yet happened.

- In the post-WWII era, there were fewer economic class distinctions in the U.S. Incomes and standards of living were more evenly distributed across the country. Places like Palo Alto and St. Clair Shores were quite similar. But today, economic inequality has rend the U.S. apart and created vastly different life experiences for elites and the middle class. The U.S. is moving toward a “coming class war.”

In summary, the key ideas are: 1) Meritocracy has imposed unbearable psychological pressures on elites. 2) Elites are calling for change but remain stuck in a cycle of overwork and burnout. 3) There used to be more economic equality and shared experiences across classes in the U.S. but today the country is increasingly polarized by class. 4) These tensions could 

- The 1968 slogan “Same Bosses, Same Fight” was inaccurate. At the time, there were still vast differences between rich students and poor workers in terms of their material conditions and life chances. 

- Today, meritocratic inequality harms both the elite and the middle/working classes. The elite are trapped in a destructive “tournament” to maximize their human capital, while the rest are condemned to “imposed idleness.”

- A recognition of the harms of meritocracy could unite these groups in support of greater equality. The elite would regain authentic freedom and leisure, while the middle class would regain income, status, and dignity. This would be a “win-win” rather than a “leaky bucket.”

- Achieving this will require political organizing and activism, not just theorizing. But theory can help by revealing the “ideological traps” that meritocracy creates, blinding people to their real interests. Reflection shows that the elite and middle/working classes can only escape meritocracy’s harms together.  

- In sum, the book argues for a “new politics of democratic equality” to counter meritocratic inequality. This would require cooperation between the elite and middle/working classes, who have a shared interest in reducing the concentration of “human capital and industry in an ever-narrowing elite.” Greater equality would benefit both groups. 

- McDonald’s founded Hamburger University in 1961 to train employees. It has graduated over 275,000 students. In 2011, in celebrates its 50th anniversary. 

- McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook, like most CEOs and top executives, has never done frontline work in the fast food industry. In 2016, Easterbrook made over $15 million, more than 500 times the minimum wage. This huge gap is due, in part, to the market for executives and technology enabling greater productivity and profits.

- Finance has become an increasingly elite industry. Before 1980, finance workers were little more educated or higher earning than average. Now, finance workers tend to be highly educated and very highly paid. The incomes of elite finance workers have grown enormously, far outpacing other sectors. 

- The financial sector and its elite workers exemplify “meritocratic inequality”— very high pay for those at the very top, with pay based more on education, skills, and job performance than in other sectors. The pay of top hedge fund managers and Wall Street executives has increased tenfold since the 1970s. 

- Finance and its elite now dominate the upper reaches of the income distribution and the ranks of billionaires. About 20% of billionaires work in finance. Over 10% of the 50 richest Americans are financiers or investors. 

- Though new technologies likely contribute to inequality, they may also boost wages for some low-skill service jobs by increasing demand. Minimum wage laws and the social safety net have also helped address poverty.

So in summary, the article argues that finance has become an elite industry with enormous pay that contributes significantly to inequality, though technology and policy also shape the distribution of wages. The huge pay of top executives, like McDonald’s CEO, relative to average workers further demonstrates the large inequalities in the U.S. economy. 

Meritocracy is an oppressive system that harms both the middle class and the elite. For the middle class, meritocracy excludes them from opportunities for achieving social and economic success. It concentrates resources and advantages in an increasingly narrow elite. Although meritocracy was supposed to promote social mobility, it now stifles it. The middle class cannot afford the high-quality education and training that the elite can. Jobs increasingly require elite credentials and education, putting the middle class at a disadvantage. 

Meritocracy also burdens the elite by requiring them to constantly work to maintain their status. Unlike hereditary aristocracies, elite status is not inherited but must be earned by each generation. The elite pour resources into educating their children from an early age to ensure they can get into top schools and jobs. The intense competition and demands of this system lead to anxiety, despair, and exhaustion in the elite, even as they enjoy material success.

In these ways, meritocracy divides society. It cuts off the middle class from achieving their aspirations while burdening the elite with intense demands to preserve their privilege. The ideology of meritocracy obscures these harms, making the system seem fair and just when in reality it promotes inequality. There is a growing discontent with meritocracy that provides an opening for critical perspectives exposing its flaws. Overall, the essay argues meritocracy itself, not its imperfect implementation, is the source of many of the problems in modern society. Here is a summary of the two sources:

- There are large gaps in school funding between wealthy states and poor states in the U.S. The top 5 wealthiest states spend almost $16,000 per student, while the poorest 5 states spend around $9,000 per student. These gaps have widened over time in parallel with income inequality. 
- Even within states, poorer school districts receive less funding than wealthier ones. In Pennsylvania, wealthy districts receive 33% more funding per student. In Connecticut, there is still a 10% gap, even after litigation aimed at equalizing funding.
- Privately raised funds for public schools, like PTAs, have increased greatly and disproportionately benefit wealthier schools. In 1995, private groups raised $197 million for public schools. By 2010, this had increased to $880 million. Some wealthy schools raise over $2,300 per student, and single fundraising events can raise $400,000. This exacerbates inequality, as these private funds are outside of the pool that must be distributed equally within a state.  
- Some high-wealth public schools have been called "public privates" because they have extravagant facilities and resources more akin to private schools. For example, Scarsdale High School, in an affluent New York suburb, spends nearly $30,000 per student, while a poor district only 30 miles away, Barbourville Independent, spends only $9,000 per student. 
- While Barbourville receives most of its funding from state and federal sources, over half of Scarsdale's funding is local. The median home value in Scarsdale is over $1 million, allowing for high local property tax funding of schools. In contrast, the median household income in Barbourville is only $20,000. 
- On average, schools that serve poorer students have less resources and less experienced teachers compared to schools that serve affluent students. There are systematic advantages for students in wealthy schools and districts.

In summary, there are large inequities in public school funding in the U.S. that disproportionately disadvantage poorer schools and districts. Local funding, private fundraising, and gaps between states widen these inequities. Students in affluent, well-funded schools enjoy significant advantages over students in poorer, under-funded schools. Here is a summary of the source:

- The exit polls from the 2016 election show that Trump’s base of support came disproportionately from white voters without a college degree. Trump outperformed Romney’s 2012 results most strongly among this demographic. 

- Trump performed well in areas affected by economic anxieties and job losses, especially in routine jobs. However, his support seemed to also come from cultural and social factors outside of economic self-interest.

- Trump’s rhetoric and policies appealed to white working-class voters’ sense of dignity and self-worth, which had been challenged by economic changes. 

- The shift to Trump was largest in places like Macomb County, Michigan, and Santa Clara County, California, that had once been strongly Democratic but have become more Republican.

- The Founding Fathers believed that democracy depended on the material security and independence of citizens. Trump’s base felt that they had lost this security and status.

- The “working rich” and Wall Street financiers have not engaged in physically demanding labor or production since at least the early 20th century. They represent “conspicuous leisure” and consumption as a marker of high social status, as described by Thorstein Veblen.

- Before the 1930s, poverty rates in the U.S. were estimated to be as high as 78%. Government programs like the New Deal and War on Poverty significantly reduced poverty and inequality in the mid-20th century.

- In the early 20th century, Wall Street operated on a leisurely schedule, with bankers working from 10 AM to 3 PM. They epitomized Veblen’s “leisure class.”

That covers the key highlights and arguments from the source. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this summary. Here is a summary of the critiques of meritocracy discussed in the pages you specified:

Critiques of the ideology of meritocracy (pp. 55, 65):
- Meritocracy ideology wrongly assumes that success and failure are solely the result of individual merit and hard work. In reality, luck and circumstance play a large role. 
- Meritocracy ideology is used to justify inequality and the status quo. It suggests that people end up at the top because they deserve it due to their merit, rather than because of unequal opportunities or advantages.

Critiques of public schools (pp. 126-28, 133, 151-54):
- Public schools promote meritocracy ideology by emphasizing standardized test scores, grades, and college admissions as the primary measures of student success and promise. This ignores the role of circumstance in outcomes.
- The U.S. public education system is highly unequal, with significant disparities in funding, resources, and teacher quality between schools in wealthy and poor areas. This undermines the notion that the system provides equal opportunity based on merit.
- The college admissions process favors privileged students by relying heavily on factors like test scores, GPAs, and extracurricular activities that strongly correlate with family income and wealth. This calls into question whether admissions are based primarily on merit.

Critiques of public sector wages (pp. 55-56): 
- The claim that pay in the public sector is based on merit and value is undermined by the fact that public sector wages have failed to keep up with private sector wages for comparable work. Public school teachers, for example, are paid significantly less than private sector workers with similar education and skills. This suggests their pay is not wholly determined by merit or the value of their work.

In summary, the critiques argue that meritocracy is more an ideological belief than an accurate description of how opportunity and success are allocated in society. They challenge the notion that factors like hard work, natural talent, and merit alone determine outcomes. Instead, circumstance, luck, inequality, and systemic barriers and advantages also play a substantial role. Here's a summary:

- According to several studies, elite colleges admit many more students from wealthy families than poor ones. For example, some research finds Harvard and Princeton admit 25 wealthy students for each poor student. While some elite schools are more economically diverse, all are still heavily skewed toward the wealthy. 

- Combinatorics helps explain why having wealthy parents is nearly essential yet far from sufficient for getting into an elite college. In a hypothetical society with steady population size, if one-sixth of children from the top 1% of households by income attend the elite colleges, they would fill half the spots, while the remaining half would be distributed among the other 99% of the population. So wealthy parents would be almost necessary but not nearly enough.

- U.S. higher education spending has skyrocketed, growing much faster than enrollment. In 1970, the U.S. spent $23 billion on higher ed (in 2014 dollars). By 2014-15, that had grown to $536 billion. Higher ed went from 0.7% of GDP in 1929-30 to 2.6% in 2014.

- Elite college spending has also soared. From 2001 to 2015, Ivy League enrollment rose 12% while spending rose 102% (in constant dollars).  

- The huge increases in higher ed spending have far outstripped growth in faculty or facilities, going instead to administration and student services. Critics argue this spending arms race fuels rising college costs while contributing little to educational quality. Supporters counter that spending improves the college experience and education.

The summary outlines the key facts and arguments around increasing higher education spending, lack of economic diversity at elite colleges, and the necessity of wealthy parents for admission to top schools. The assistant identifies the most important points, statistics, studies, and counterarguments in the source material. 

- Views on social questions are shaped by one's social position. The affluent tend to support free markets while the less affluent support unions and government intervention. 

- Silicon Valley promotes a myth of meritocracy to justify vast income inequality. In reality, success depends heavily on social connections and access to elite education.

- Goldman Sachs shifted in the 1980s to aggressively pursue wealth over all else. This contributed to a "locker room" culture indifferent to clients and counterparties.

- Elite universities like Yale oppose unions for staff and graduate students. They claim unions disrupt their culture of "shared governance" while exploiting cheap labor.

- The leisure gap between rich and poor has widened. The rich have more leisure time, while the poor have less. Fitness and wellness have become status symbols for the elite.  

- Social lives differ by class. The rich have more active social lives, while the working class nurtures "rooted" relationships with family and long-time friends. The rich discuss travel and culture; the working class discuss health problems, religion, and guns.  

- Consumption patterns differ dramatically by class due to inequality. The rich buy expensive, artisanal goods, while the poor buy mass-market and discount goods. Consumption data can now predict income.

- Homeownership was once a middle-class aspiration but is now concentrated at the top. It rose in the mid-20th century but has stalled since the 1970s. 

- Companies like Sears and Ford once paid high wages so workers could buy goods, fueling economic growth. Today's low-wage companies weaken aggregate demand. Automation may worsen this trend without redistribution.

In summary, there are deepening divisions across society in attitudes, lifestyles, and opportunities based on class.  Greater inequality has coincided with a clustering of elites detached from the rest of society. These trends pose risks to social cohesion, health, and economic vibrancy. Reducing inequality may require policy reforms and efforts to cultivate cross-class understanding. 

Elite spending on luxury goods and lavish dining in Washington, D.C. is extremely high compared to 
any other major city in America. Dinners regularly cost $200 per person or more, not including wine. 
Elites have found “ways of expropriating wealth” through trusts and offshore tax havens. Nearly $18 
trillion of assets are held offshore, allowing elites to avoid taxes. 

Top tax rates on the wealthy have fallen by a third since the 1950s. Billionaire Warren Buffett pays a 
lower tax rate than his secretary. The U.S. tax code has become effectively flat. The SEC failed to 
severely punish Goldman Sachs for its role in the financial crisis.

Prominent commentators have referred to poor white Americans as "economically useless" and "the stagnant pool."
Politicians like Paul Ryan have called them "takers." Both liberal and conservative politicians like Mitt Romney, Barack Obama, 
and Hillary Clinton have made insensitive comments about poor white voters that they later regretted.

Many poor white Americans feel like "strangers in their own land" who have waited patiently for prosperity only to see others 
like blacks, women, and immigrants advanced through government aid. Studies show these voters believe they have faced discrimination 
and that the Democratic party favors minorities over them. They see themselves as "stay-at-home migrants" whose values remain fixed as society changes around them.

Friedrich Nietzsche referred to religion as an "anesthesia" or "narcotic" for dulling the pain of life's hardships. Similarly, the deep story 
described by Arlie Hochschild provides an explanation that dulls the pain of stagnation and lack of opportunity for poor whites. Here's a summary:

Nietzsche argues that for slave morality, expressing emotion is a way to find relief from suffering. Slave-owning societies denied language of victimhood to slaves. Jamie Walsh, a Trump voter, says “the whole idea” of privilege is wrong because “you’ve got people busting their asses every day.” Meritocracy ties status to education, casting the intellectualism of non-elites as betrayal. An intellectual reflects that in her middle-class upbringing, displays of learning were suspect. 

Joan Williams says Trump voters “are more educated” but see elites as “skilled manipulators.” The white working class faced rising addiction, overdose and suicide rates. Obama's diverse, Ivy League-educated cabinet contrasted with Trump's "blue-collar billionaire" appeal. Trump said “I love the poorly educated.” J.D. Vance said Trump “under[stood] the depth” of working-class suffering. Trump voters agreed elites “look down on” them and minorities are “less deserving.” Alec MacGillis says Trump tapped a “profound contempt” for elites.

Trump won white voters making $50-100K by 39 points. His appeals to victimhood and attacks on meritocracy and pluralism resonated. 

The term “meritocracy” was coined in the 1950s by Michael Young to describe a system where people achieve positions of power and influence based on talent and effort rather than social class or wealth. Although originally intended as a dystopia, the concept of meritocracy has been embraced widely. 

Meritocracy has preserved and recreated social hierarchies. It allows the upper classes to maintain political and social power by emphasizing credentials and skills over inheritance. Privileged families are able to pass down advantages to their children through education and opportunity. Although meritocracy claims to reward ability and hard work, it often perpetuates the influence of elite universities and socioeconomic status.

Like aristocracy, meritocracy combines economic, political and cultural power. Originally, land ownership was the main source of wealth and status. The Industrial Revolution led to competing hierarchies based on physical capital, skills, and credentials. Now, meritocracy is unifying these through an emphasis on higher education and high-skilled labor. As it overcomes other hierarchies, meritocracy is becoming more entrenched and unequal.

Meritocracy resembles aristocracy in claiming greater virtue and ability as the basis for power and status. However, unlike aristocracy, meritocracy is based more on competition and gaining rewards through effort and skill acquisition rather than inheritance. Although meritocracy claims to benefit society as a whole by allowing the most talented to achieve positions of influence, it primarily benefits the upper classes by allowing them to perpetuate their power based on the ability to cultivate skill and credentialing. Overall, meritocracy has replaced aristocracy as a system of hierarchy and social closure using new norms that legitimize inequality.

In summary, meritocracy has become a new mechanism for the concentration and perpetuation of power and privilege, despite claims that it rewards ability and benefits society as a whole. Like aristocracy, it combines economic, political and social hierarchies in a self-reinforcing system. However, it does so based on the acquisition of skill and educational credentials rather than the inheritance of land or social position. 

1. Acemoglu discussed how newly invented office machinery reduced the demand for high school clerical skills in the early 20th century, though he did not claim this induced these innovations. In contrast, Goldin and Katz found the return to high school fell from 1915 to 1945, too long for induced innovation. This disagreement may be because Acemoglu studied high school degrees while Goldin and Katz studied years of post-elementary schooling. 

2. Other factors beyond education and work contribute to US income inequality, though they often complement the mechanism focused on here. 

3. The US has a GDP per capita of $50,000.  Countries with GDPs over $50,000 and large university-educated populations have seen rising inequality.

4. Germany has expanded university access, with university attendance rising from 5% to 33% of adults since 1970. But Germany also has a strong vocational education system, with 70% of young workers getting training. Apprenticeships commonly cost $10,000 per year.  Worker turnover is lower in Germany, with workers holding 1-2 jobs in their first 10 years versus 6 in the US.

5. Germany’s childcare costs are capped at $90 per month. Capital investment in Germany has focused on complementing high-skilled workers, even within industries. This has decreased wage inequality by a third compared to the US.

6. The returns to skill and inequality rise and fall together across nations. Proxies suggest parental investment in children’s education also rises with income. The growing meritocracy in elite US education is "by design."

7. The affluent in the US are "pulling the ladder of opportunity up behind them." This is similar to the "resource curse" in developing nations, where resource wealth limits opportunity. 

- Late 1980s hostile takeovers and leveraged buyouts of firms increased CEO job insecurity and led CEOs to cut costs aggressively to boost short-term share prices. Downgrades in stock analysts’ recommendations increased the chance a CEO would be fired within 6 months. CEO firings quadrupled between 1995 and 2005. 

- Investment managers, seeking short-term gains, pressed firms to cut costs and increase share prices. Employers increasingly opposed unions and were more aggressive in deterring unionization. They moved away from managerial paradigms that emphasized job security and benefits in favor of “meritocratic” hierarchies that empowered executives to maximize personal pay.

- Management became "financialized" as executives aimed to maximize share prices. Law and consulting firms that handled mergers and acquisitions grew, hiring top graduates. These firms reshaped management by providing advice on downsizing and cost-cutting. 

- Consulting firms like McKinsey expanded in the 1970s. They hired almost exclusively from elite schools and MBA programs. They gave advice that "broke down" organizations and eliminated middle managers, contributing to executives amassing more power and pay while jobs were cut. The advice was aimed at swift cuts to boost short-term gains rather than long-term strategy.
 
- Executive pay rose dramatically while typical workers’ pay stagnated. CEOs made 300 times typical workers. The top 1% gained a large share of income and stock ownership. Safeway cut jobs and replaced its motto of "Safeway Offers Security" with "Targeted Returns on Current Investment" after a leveraged buyout.

- In summary, these trends led executives to gain more power and prioritize short-term gains over long-term financial health or job security. Their actions and the consulting advice they followed often had detrimental effects on workers, jobs, and firms. 

The town of St. Clair Shores, Michigan was once a prosperous middle-class community, but it has been in decline for decades. Its population and economy have stagnated since the 1970s. Household incomes are around the national median, and poverty is below average, but there is little opportunity for economic growth or social mobility. Residents embrace a vision of an idyllic, civic-minded community, but in reality, the town has little to look forward to and much to fear regarding its future. 

The midcentury manufacturing jobs that built the middle class are gone and are not coming back. St. Clair Shores has little new business investment or job opportunities. Few residents have college degrees, and there are virtually no high-paying or elite jobs in the town. As a result, incomes have remained flat, and the gap between the town’s richest and poorest residents remains small.

The town’s culture and amenities have stagnated. There are no new or stylish businesses. People go to the same diners and shops that have been there for decades. The town depends on the accumulated wealth of older residents to preserve existing institutions like the library, but budgets have declined, and facilities are outdated.

The fate of St. Clair Shores demonstrates how meritocracy has harmed middle-class communities across America. Technological changes and globalization have eliminated millions of middle-class manufacturing jobs. The spoils of economic growth have gone mostly to the highly educated elite, while median incomes have barely risen in decades. At the same time, elite families are able to invest heavily in educating their children, locking in their advantages. Middle-class children face diminished opportunities and prospects for upward mobility.  

The story of St. Clair Shores is a window into the lived experience of meritocracy for the middle class. While proponents argue meritocracy is fair and just, in reality, it has led to economic and social stagnation for communities like St. Clair Shores. Meritocracy has morally insulted and debased the middle class, even as it has provided massive rewards for the elite. 

- Meritocracy has made competition for elite positions much more intense. Admission to top schools and jobs has become very selective. Success requires immense effort and sacrifice. 

- The elite are trapped in an endless struggle to achieve and maintain their status. Their incomes and jobs are precarious, depending on constantly outperforming competitors. This creates immense anxiety and insecurity.

- The elite acquire their high incomes not through unearned privilege but through their human capital— their skills, training, and education. This requires constant intensive work to exploit. Unlike traditional forms of wealth, human capital provides little freedom or leisure. It enslaves rather than liberates.

- The elite are dominated by the need to build and demonstrate their merit through achievement. Their self-worth and identity become entirely defined by status and success. They lose touch with other life pursuits andvalues. 

- The single-minded focus on gaining and keeping elite status leads to alienation from oneself, one’s relationships, and any intrinsic worth or meaning in one’s work. Life becomes solely about gaining a higher rung on the ladder. Everything is a means to that end.

- Though the elite enjoy immense rewards, their lives are burdened by the need to constantly achieve and perform to gain those rewards. The narrow elite simply cannot shoulder the psychological and social costs of a system centered around their intensive production. 

- In short, meritocracy imposes a “heavy human tax” on the elite even as it enables their lavish material success. It strips away freedom, identity, meaning, and balance in favor of status. 

- The incomes of the wealthy in America have shifted dramatically toward capital over the last few decades. Estimates suggest the top 1% now receive over half their income from capital, up from less than half in the 1960s and 1970s. The top 0.1% receive over 65% of their income from capital.   

- Several factors have driven this shift:

1) The incomes of founders and executives of large firms have become dominated by stock, stock options, and carried interest. This is counted as capital income but is economically a return to labor. 

2) Income from pensions and housing, which stems from labor, has declined as a share of the wealthy's income. 

3) The financial sector's share of income has increased, and much of its income (like carried interest) is counted as capital gains but is economically a return to labor.

4) The wealthy are now working later into their lives, so even retirement income stems more from labor. 

- Although capital's share of total national income has increased modestly, the wealthy own a large and increasing share of capital. So any increase in capital's share of income disproportionately accrues to the wealthy. 

- In summary, while the tax code may treat the incomes of the wealthy as increasingly derived from capital, economically the majority still stems from labor. The wealthy have simply devised legal mechanisms, like stock grants and carried interest, to have their labor income taxed at lower capital gains rates. So it remains appropriate to say that the wealthy, in a fundamental sense, remain workers - they have just gained more of the profits from their work. 

- In the 1950s, Yale University embraced meritocratic admissions reform, moving away from a system that privileged students from elite boarding schools. The new admissions policies, pioneered by admissions director R. Inslee “Inky” Clark, emphasized standardized test scores, academic achievement, and potential for success at Yale. 

- By 1955, the percentage of Yale students coming from top prep schools dropped from over 60% to under 20%. This represented a radical change that opened up Yale to new groups of high-achieving students. Yale president A. Whitney Griswold supported these reforms, saying he did not want Yale to be an “extended luxury cruise line” for prep school graduates.

- Clark aimed to find students who would benefit most from Yale, regardless of their background. However, ability to pay tuition remained a consideration in admissions. The meritocratic changes resulted in a more socioeconomically and geographically diverse student body at Yale.

- Similar meritocratic reforms took place at other top universities like Harvard around the same time. The growing use of standardized tests like the SAT enabled these schools to evaluate students in a consistent way, rather than relying primarily on admissions officers’ personal connections and judgments.

- The meritocratic turn represented a major change in how elite higher education in America operated. It opened up these institutions to new groups of students based on their potential and achievement. However, the merit system was still imperfect, as admissions policies continued to favor those who could afford elite college tuition. The legacy of meritocracy at Yale and other top schools shaped higher education for generations.

That covers the key highlights around Yale’s transition to a meritocratic admissions model in the postwar period. Please let me know if you would like me to explain or expand on any part of this summary. 

- Safeway was a socially responsible company in the mid-20th century. It invested in employee development and had managers that worked their way up from entry-level positions. CEO pay was relatively low compared to today. 

- Starting in the late 1970s, financial, legal, and managerial innovations transformed corporations and management. Companies started relying more on debt financing instead of reinvesting profits. This subjected them to pressure from creditors and shareholders to maximize profits. 

- New legal frameworks enabled hostile takeovers and activist investing on a large scale. Investment banks and private equity firms used leveraged buyouts and other tactics to take over companies and pressure managers. The threat of takeovers led companies to adopt measures to increase shareholder value.

- These financial and legal changes drove managerial innovations that displaced the midcentury “democratic” management model in favor of a meritocratic one concentrated at the top. Investors could effectively monitor and incentivize top managers but not lower-level employees. This led companies to flatten hierarchies and give more power and pay to top executives. 

- The innovations behind these changes were developed by highly skilled, meritocratically educated professionals in finance, law, and management. Corporate raiders relied on expert managers and the prospect of replacing incumbent managers. Elite law firms and investment banks cultivated meritocratic cultures and sought out top talent.

- In summary, financialization and the rise of meritocracy led to a new corporate focus on shareholder interests, hierarchy flattening, concentration of pay and power at the top, and reliance on highly skilled professionals. Midcentury corporations with more democratic and socially-oriented management gave way to a new meritocratic model. Here is a summary of the entries:

- Meritocracy is the idea that people should advance in society based on their abilities and efforts, not based on their family background or other inherited privileges. 
- Meritocracy seemed appealing as an alternative to aristocracy, promising equality and fairness. But meritocracy has failed to deliver on its promises. 
- Today, meritocracy contributes to inequality by giving advantages to children from wealthy families and elite schools. It blames those who are less successful for lacking merit, even though the system is rigged against them.  
- Meritocracy also harms the elite by pushing them into a relentless competition for status through excessive work and lavish spending on elite education. 
- Meritocracy has led to a divide between the elite and the middle class, breeding resentment, dysfunction, and disrespect in society.
- The author is a product and agent of meritocracy, having attended elite schools and now teaching at Yale Law School. But he argues that meritocracy’s promises are false. 
- Meritocracy claimed to replace aristocracy by allowing people to achieve status through talent and effort. But in reality, it has become a mechanism for concentrating wealth and privilege, creating a new aristocracy.  
- Meritocracy’s rhetoric and rituals, like graduation ceremonies, aim to show how it promotes justice and benefits society. But these ideals mask the harms meritocracy inflicts. 
- In summary, the taproot of society’s troubles today is too much meritocracy, not too little. Merit itself has become an idol, and meritocracy has betrayed its democratic promise.
