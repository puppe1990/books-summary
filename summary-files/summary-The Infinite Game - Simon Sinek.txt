 

- There are two paths, one leading to Victory and one leading to Fulfillment
- The path to Victory is focused on winning, competition, and achieving an endpoint. It provides a thrill but is fleeting.
- The path to Fulfillment is a long journey. It requires perseverance but allows one to enjoy the process. It attracts others to join along the way and continues even after one is gone.  
- The key choice is between a finite game focused on winning or an infinite game focused on fulfillment.

The metaphor suggests that we have a choice between short-term thinking focused on competition and endpoints versus long-term thinking focused on meaning, purpose, and continuity. The finite path is more superficial and temporary while the infinite path leads to something deeper and lasting. The direction we choose depends on whether we want to simply win in the moment or find true fulfillment and meaning.

 

- There are two types of games: finite games and infinite games. 
- Finite games have fixed rules, players, start and end. The aim is to win. Examples are sports matches.
- Infinite games have unknown players, no fixed rules and no end. The aim is to perpetuate the game. Examples are business, education, politics. 
- Leaders often have a finite mindset and talk about “winning”, “beating competition” and “being number one” even though infinite games have no finish line. 
- A finite mindset leads to decline in trust, cooperation and innovation. An infinite mindset leads to higher levels of these and benefits.
- The game of business is an infinite game. Though companies set metrics and timelines to evaluate themselves, the game itself has no end. 
- To succeed in business, we must stop thinking about winning and focus on building organizations that can perpetuate themselves for generations. This also often leads to better short term performance.
- Microsoft and Apple are examples of the two mindsets. Microsoft was focused on beating Apple. Apple focused on advancing their cause of helping teachers and students. 
- The value of an organization with an infinite mindset is measured by others' desire to contribute to its continued success, not its success based on arbitrary metrics. Leaders work to inspire continued effort, investment and contribution rather than take something to meet metrics.
- The infinite mindset aims to leave organizations better than found them. Examples are Lego, which created a timeless toy, and Tesla, which aims to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.

The key differences in the mindsets and benefits of finite and infinite games are illustrated through examples. The infinite mindset and game are argued to be superior for business success and benefit.

 

- Leaders and companies that take an infinite perspective play to keep playing, not to win or end the game. They build organizations that can survive beyond current leaders and consider the impact of decisions on stakeholders beyond themselves. 
- In contrast, finite players aim to win and end the game. They fear surprises and disruption, react to competitors, and make self-serving decisions that often fail to benefit the organization or community in the long run.
- Infinite-minded leaders embrace surprises and innovation, focusing on advancing a vision that benefits all rather than fixating on finite goals. Companies led this way often see greater success, resilience, and ability to adapt to change. 
- Victorinox is an example of an infinite-minded company. Despite major disruption after 9/11, it avoided layoffs, invested in innovation, and found new markets. Now much stronger, its CEO thinks "in generations." In contrast, the U.S. misunderstood and underestimated its enemy in Vietnam due to a finite mindset.
- The benefits of an infinite mindset include innovation, brand loyalty, resilience, and longevity. The detriments of a finite mindset include lack of adaptation, short-term thinking, and failure to understand others or the bigger picture.

In summary, the key distinction is between building to win and end the game (finite) versus building to continue playing (infinite). An infinite perspective, openness to surprises, and consideration of stakeholders beyond oneself tend to serve organizations and communities better in the long run. A finite perspective of trying to defeat others often backfires or causes organizations and leaders to misunderstand situations and miss opportunities.

 

- The US approached the Vietnam War with a finite mindset, assuming it had clear objectives and an endpoint. But the North Vietnamese were playing an infinite game, fighting for their long-term survival. The US exhausted resources and will trying to "win" a game that had no end.

- Microsoft made the same mistake with the Zune. It focused on competing for market share and "beating" the iPod, rather than building something to advance a long-term vision. The Zune failed quickly. 

- Finite-minded leaders prioritize short-term metrics, reacting to competitors, and "winning." They employ harmful strategies like cost-cutting, layoffs, and acquisitions. This damages company culture and long-term viability. Employees become self-interested and risk-averse.

- Infinite-minded leaders focus on building company value and culture for the long run. They have a vision beyond any individual product, metric, or timeframe. This leads to more sustainable success, as with Apple's focus on possibilities and Microsoft's original vision "to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more."

- Steve Ballmer epitomized a finite mindset as Microsoft CEO. He defined success around beating competitors in a 13-year timeframe. An infinite leader would have focused on strengthening Microsoft to thrive for generations. Ballmer left the company poorly equipped to survive long-term challenges.

- Finite goals like market share, rankings, and short-term profits do not equal long-term success. Infinite-minded leadership is required to build an organization that can perpetually learn, adapt, and advance a vision. This is the only path to sustainability.

 

- Leaders and companies that operate with a finite mindset become obsessed with short-term gains and quarterly results. This leads to a decline in cooperation, innovation, and trust within the organization. 
- Microsoft suffered from this under Steve Ballmer's leadership. Although the company remained dominant for a while due to Bill Gates' legacy, it lost its vision and innovation. 
- The average lifespan of S&P 500 companies has dropped significantly, in part due to too many finite-minded leaders. 
- Finite-minded leadership has become the norm in business and is taught in business schools. This has led to more volatility and instability.
- We have to choose whether to join a game and whether to play with a finite or infinite mindset. To thrive in the infinite game of business, we need to play with an infinite mindset.
- To lead with an infinite mindset, we must:

1. Advance a just cause 
2. Build trusting teams
3. Study worthy rivals 
4. Prepare for existential flexibility
5. Demonstrate courageous leadership

- Maintaining an infinite mindset is challenging but essential. We will stray at times due to human failings and the seduction of finite games. But we must resist the urge to abandon the infinite mindset. 
- We need to be transparent about the mindset we choose so others can understand the implications and adjust accordingly. When people see we have adopted the five practices of infinite leadership, they will want to join us.

 

- During World War 2, the city of Leningrad endured a Nazi siege for over 2.5 years. Over a million citizens died, many due to starvation. 
- However, hidden within the city was a seed bank containing enough food to feed the population. It was collected by Nikolai Vavilov, a botanist devoted to ending hunger.
- Vavilov traveled the world collecting crop seeds and studying genetics to breed more resilient crops. His vision was to create a seed bank as "backup for all the world's food". 
- Vavilov built up the seed bank as head of the Department of Applied Botany, though he was later imprisoned and died under Stalin. However, his team protected the seed bank.
- Though surrounded by edible food, Vavilov's team refused to eat it, willing to die to protect his vision. They felt part of a greater "Just Cause" to help humanity. 
- A Just Cause is a vision of a future state that motivates sacrifice. It gives work and life meaning beyond any one person or short-term wins. Leaders need a clear Just Cause.
- Unlike winning, a Just Cause provides lasting fulfillment. It makes people willing to sacrifice to advance the vision, whether by accepting less pay, long hours, or even risking their lives.
- The motivation behind a Just Cause is not to win but to keep advancing the vision. It is bigger than any one organization or person.

In summary, the story of Vavilov and the Leningrad seed bank illustrates the power of a Just Cause to motivate and inspire sacrifice. When people feel part of something greater than themselves, they will go to extreme lengths to advance that vision. Leaders must have a clear Just Cause to lead effectively in the "Infinite Game".

 

- We will love our jobs if we work for an organization with a Just Cause. We may like our jobs some days, but we will always love the Just Cause. 

- A Just Cause is different from our WHY. Our WHY comes from our past and is our origin story. A Just Cause is about the future and the world we hope to build. We can have only one WHY but many Just Causes. Our WHY is fixed but a Just Cause can evolve.

- A WHY is like the foundation of a house. A Just Cause is the vision of the ideal house we want to build. Working toward a Just Cause gives our work meaning. It inspires us to look beyond short-term rewards.

- We know a Cause is just when we are willing to sacrifice for it so others can continue the work. Examples include the US founders and Nikolai Vavilov's work to preserve crop diversity. 

- Many organizations have purpose or mission statements but few qualify as a Just Cause. A Just Cause must be:

1. For something - affirmative and optimistic. It inspires hope rather than opposition. 
2. Inclusive - open to all who want to contribute. 
3. Service-oriented - primarily benefiting others.
4. Resilient - enduring political, technological and cultural change. 
5. Idealistic - big, bold and ultimately impossible to fully achieve.

- "For something" ignites the human spirit. "Against something" elicits reactions and focuses on enemies. "For something" focuses on the unbuilt future. Fighting poverty is against something. Fighting for the right of all to provide for their families is for something.

- The US founders stood against Britain but fought for the ideals of liberty and equality. The Declaration of Independence leads with the vision they were fighting for.

 

The passage discusses attributes of a “just cause” that make it inclusive, service-oriented, and resilient:

Inclusive:
- A just cause invites people to join a cause bigger than themselves. It gives people a sense of belonging and purpose. 
- A clear vision of the future that a just cause articulates attracts believers and ignites passion in people. Generic or vague causes fail to do so.
- Organizations should hire, attract customers and investors who share passion for their just cause. This builds a loyal base.

Service-oriented:
- A just cause benefits contributors (e.g. employees, investors) and beneficiaries (e.g. customers, communities). But the primary benefit flows to the beneficiaries. 
- If the primary benefit goes to the contributors, it is not a just cause but a “vanity project.” Leaders and organizations should adopt a “servant leadership” mindset.  
- A service orientation builds loyalty from employees, customers and investors, which gives an organization longevity and strength.

Resilient:
- A just cause needs to endure changes in politics, technology and culture. Leaders and organizations should make decisions to equip themselves for the long-term infinite game. 
- Short-term finite thinking focuses on benefiting primarily from rewards and compensation. It lacks resilience. 
- Resilience comes from building a loyal base of stakeholders committed to the just cause. Money alone cannot provide this.

In summary, a just cause should be inclusive, service-oriented and resilient. It articulates a vision that ignites passion, benefits beneficiaries first, and endures change through building loyalty. This allows organizations and leaders to succeed in the long run.

 
- A Just Cause is timeless and enduring, like the Declaration of 
Independence. It inspires people for generations.
- A Just Cause is greater than any products or services. It is the 
reason an organization exists. If defined around products, the 
organization risks becoming obsolete.
- Leaders should articulate the Just Cause in writing to 
preserve it for the future. Without it in writing, the Cause may fade 
or become diluted over time.
- Many organizations mistake other purposes for a Just Cause, 
such as corporate social responsibility, being the best, growth, or 
moonshots. These may work in the short term but not for surviving 
the Infinite Game.
- To have a Just Cause, an organization must meet five criteria:

1. Idealistic - Big, bold, and ultimately impossible to achieve.  
2. Durable - Can withstand change and crisis.
3. Just cause - Making a just cause for why the organization 
exists. 
4. Measurement - Having a clear way to track how well the 
infinite cause is served. 
5. Dignifying - Give meaning to people, honors human dignity
    
- The idealized journey of a Just Cause feels like an iceberg - we 
only see what has already been accomplished, but there is always 
more beneath the surface to achieve. Leaders must remind people 
of how much farther there is to go.
- Without a Just Cause, an organization lacks purpose and direction.

 

- A false cause will not sustain an organization in the long run. It is better to recognize a false cause early on.

- A true just cause is deeply personal for those who believe in it and advance it. It cannot just be used as a branding tool. 

- Big, audacious goals like moonshots are inspiring but finite. They are not a just cause in themselves which is infinite. A just cause provides the context for such finite goals.

- Vision statements that are egocentric and focus primarily on being the "best" or the "leader" do not provide a just cause. They are inward-focused and miss opportunities to provide real value to customers. They often lead companies to cling to outdated business models.

- A just cause should drive the business model, not the other way around. Companies too focused on their products or technologies often miss bigger opportunities and do not utilize all their employees fully.

- "Being the best" is a temporary position and a weak foundation. Infinite-minded leaders aim to keep getting better rather than focus on being the best.

 

- The author argues that “better” is a better goal than “best” because it suggests constant progress and invites people to contribute to improvement. 

- The author uses an analogy of a neighbor going on “vacation” without specifying a destination to show that “growth” is not a good enough goal or purpose on its own. Growth needs a larger context or purpose to be meaningful. Money and growth are means to an end, not ends in themselves. 

- The author argues that corporate social responsibility programs are not a good enough purpose or “cause” on their own. They need to be part of a broader strategy to advance a real purpose or cause. A company’s cause should guide both how it makes and gives away money. 

- The author uses the example of Walmart to show how a company can lose its way when it loses sight of its real purpose or “just cause.” Under its founder Sam Walton, Walmart’s purpose was to serve average Americans by offering low prices. But later leaders focused more on growth, profits, and efficiency over purpose. 

- The author argues that Walmart’s later CEO Mike Duke was the wrong choice to revive the company’s real purpose based on his focus on managing growth and returns over serving people. The order in which Duke described the company’s priorities revealed his actual focus.

- Under Duke’s leadership, Walmart’s stock price rose for a while but the brand was hurt by various scandals related to how it treated people. The author implies this was the result of losing sight of the company’s original purpose.

In summary, the key ideas are:

1) A good purpose or “cause” is necessary for meaningful or sustainable growth and progress. 

2) Corporate social responsibility is not a sufficient purpose or cause on its own.

3) A company’s stated priorities and goals reveal its actual purpose and focus, for better or worse. 

4) Losing sight of a company’s original noble purpose can lead to a decline in its brand and relationships.

5) “Better” is a better goal than “best” because it suggests constant progress.

 

- Walmart faced numerous problems in the 2010s, including class action lawsuits, employee protests and walkouts, community protests against new stores, a congressional investigation, and declining morale. These issues were caused in part by finite-minded leadership focused on growth and short-term gains rather than the company's vision and purpose. 

- Many companies put executives focused on finite goals in leadership roles that require an infinite mindset, with damaging results. Examples include John Sculley at Apple, Robert Nardelli at Home Depot, and Kevin Rollins at Dell. While skilled executives, their finite mindsets caused harm. In contrast, infinite-minded leaders like Steve Jobs and Michael Dell were able to repair the damage.

- The responsibilities of executives like CFOs and CTOs are clear from their titles. But the title of CEO does not specify responsibilities, contributing to confusion over the role and a tendency to focus on finite goals. The title of Chief Vision Officer or CVO would better convey the need to focus on the company's vision and purpose.

- Traditionally, CFOs and COOs are seen as next in line for the CEO role. But while they understand company operations intimately, they often have a finite mindset focused on growth and profits. In contrast, an infinite-minded CVO focuses on the company's vision and purpose. The CVO and COO/CFO roles require different mindsets and skill sets, though they can work well together in partnership. 

- Some CFOs and COOs have reached the limit of their skills and are not equipped to lead at the forefront, though they remain vital to operations. While the CVO role often receives more publicity and praise, both the CVO and COO/CFO must recognize their partnership and shared purpose. Like the relationship between military officers and enlisted ranks, they have different career paths and responsibilities but work toward the same end.

- For a CFO or COO to succeed as CVO, they must adapt to the new role by developing an infinite mindset and learning new skills focused on vision and purpose. Otherwise, they will likely default to their existing finite skills and mindset.

 

- The average lifespan of companies has declined dramatically, from over 60 years in the 1950s to less than 20 years today. This is often blamed on disruptive technologies, but the root cause is actually shortsightedness and a finite mindset in business leaders. 

- Milton Friedman promoted the idea that the sole purpose of business is to maximize profits for shareholders. This theory of “shareholder primacy” has been dominant since the 1970s but is flawed and finite-minded.

- Adam Smith and early capitalists had a more infinite view. Smith said the goal of business should be to serve the interests of consumers, not just producers or shareholders. But he recognized people also act in self-interest (“the invisible hand”).

- Before shareholder primacy, US corporations and executives saw themselves as stewards serving shareholders, bondholders, employees, communities - not just maximizing shareholder profits. This led to more stability and shared prosperity.

- The modern form of capitalism focused on short-term gains and shareholder profits is an “abuse” of capitalism that looks nothing like what Smith envisioned or how companies operated for most of the 20th century. It is finite-minded, not infinite.

- The summary outlines how a shift to finite, short-term thinking in business and embrace of “shareholder primacy” theory led to a more abusive form of capitalism focused on immediate profits over long-term interests of companies, employees, communities and society. An infinite mindset is needed to fix this.

 

The author argues that the current view that the sole purpose of a company is to maximize profits and shareholder value is flawed and damaging. This view, promoted by Milton Friedman and others, has led to a “broken” form of capitalism that benefits a few at the expense of the many and long-term societal progress. It encourages unethical behavior and short-term thinking in the pursuit of profits. 

The author says companies should have a “Just Cause”—a purpose beyond just making money, like improving lives. Having a purpose leads to more value and profits in the long run. Capitalism should be about progress, not just prosperity.

Public companies and executives face immense pressure to boost stock prices and profits in the short term. Their pay is often tied to share price, so they pursue actions like cost cutting, layoffs, and share buybacks that prop up the stock price temporarily but damage the company in the long run. They follow the “ethical custom” and laws, but these just reflect and legalize the status quo, not real ethics. They often exploit loopholes until outlawed.

Executives know this short-term focus is bad but yield to the pressure. The financial crisis of 2008 and economic insecurity show the results. Investment banks and private equity firms, seeking profits, force companies into harmful actions. Entrepreneurs also face pressure to show fast growth to raise money, even though constant fast growth is unrealistic. Investors say they support the “Just Cause” but will abandon it to sell at a profit.

Infinite leaders, unlike finite leaders chasing fast growth, see growth as a variable to adjust. Slowing growth can help a company prosper long-term by avoiding problems and training to operate well. Infinite leaders look beyond growth plans to act prudently based on circumstances. The summary of the author’s view is that companies need an infinite, long-term mindset focused on purpose and progress, not a finite mindset chasing quick profits and constant growth. The latter may seem pragmatic but is shortsighted and damaging.

 

Something is not right with the current capitalist system and stock market. They are imbalanced and benefit a small group of people at the top disproportionately. This imbalance and unfairness is causing unrest and disillusionment, especially among the middle class. Leaders and those inside the system need to make changes to correct this imbalance before the people force more abrupt changes from the outside, as has happened historically in populist uprisings and revolutions. 

Companies and leaders say they exist to serve a higher purpose and their people, but in reality, they primarily serve executives and short-term investor interests. This contradiction is another source of discontent. People want to feel their work and lives have meaning and be treated fairly. They want to share in the wealth they help produce.

There were calls in the past for companies to focus on long-term impact and building strong companies, instead of reacting to short-term pressures. However, these calls fell out of favor and companies focused more on short-term gains to satisfy renter-like investors. Leaders need to go back to seeing themselves as stewards building companies to last, serving all stakeholders, not just a few. Contributions from both employees and investors are necessary and should be rewarded. Profit should go first to serving customers, which enables growth and rewards for all.

Some leaders, like BlackRock’s CEO, are again urging companies to embrace a sense of purpose beyond profits. Changes are needed to balance the system and address the sources of discontent before unrest and outside forces demand abrupt changes. The stock market works best when allowing average people to share in wealth, not just a few. Correcting imbalance and building trust should be a priority to avoid further exodus from the system.  Failure to voluntarily change an imbalanced system often results in the people forcing change, sometimes violently.

 

The Occupy Wall Street movement began in September 2011 to protest inequality and the influence of money in politics. Though the protests fizzled, the movement highlighted the fact that the system disproportionately benefits the wealthy. Five years later, populist candidates like Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump gained prominence by criticizing the system as “rigged.”

The author argues that Milton Friedman's conception of a business's sole responsibility as maximizing profit is outdated. There is a growing movement promoting alternative conceptions of business that benefit all stakeholders, not just shareholders. The author proposes that a business's responsibility should be:

1. Advance a purpose: Offer employees and customers a sense of meaning and belonging. 

2. Protect people: Operate in a way that protects employees, customers, and the environment.

3. Generate profit: Make enough money to continue achieving the first two responsibilities.

The author compares this framework to the responsibilities of a nation-state: protect citizens, give them a sense of shared purpose, and enable economic opportunity. Likewise, businesses should provide psychological safety, meaningful work, and financial opportunity.

The author argues that business goals should align with human goals. Employees deserve to feel valued, share in the fruits of their labor, and work for the benefit of something greater than themselves. Where Friedman focused on maximizing profits for shareholders, business should empower all stakeholders.

To illustrate, the author shares an anecdote about an encounter with Noah, a barista at the Four Seasons in Las Vegas. When asked if he liked his job, Noah replied enthusiastically that he loved his job. The author inferred that Noah felt an emotional connection to the purpose and mission of Four Seasons, not just the money or work itself. The author asked Noah what specifically he loved about working for Four Seasons.

 

- Noah, an employee at a luxury hotel, loves his job at the Four Seasons. He feels supported and cared for by the managers, who regularly check in on him and see how they can help. At another hotel where Noah also works, the managers are primarily focused on catching employees doing something wrong. As a result, Noah does not feel he can be himself and just wants to get through the day to collect his paycheck. 

- The difference in Noah's experience highlights the importance of leadership and environment. Noah is the same person at both jobs, but he performs much better when he feels supported. Leaders should focus on creating an environment where people can do their best work, rather than trying to extract maximum output from them.

- There are two essential "currencies" for any organization: will and resources. Resources refer to tangible, financial assets. Will refers to intangible factors like morale, motivation, and commitment. While both are important, leaders must prioritize one over the other. Leaders with a "finite" mindset tend to prioritize resources, while "infinite" minded leaders prioritize will.

- Prioritizing will over resources does not mean resources are unimportant. But when forced to choose, infinite-minded leaders will opt for options that protect will, even if the financial benefits take longer to realize. They understand that will drives discretionary effort and innovation, which are crucial for long-term success. 

- Some leaders see investing in people as an "expense" rather than understanding the costs of not investing in people, like high turnover and low productivity. However, studies show that the incremental cost of investing in people can be zero when factoring in savings from lower recruiting and training costs. Leaders should adopt an "infinite" mindset and prioritize will over resources.

 

Costco pays their employees well above average wages and provides good benefits. While this costs them more, they make up for it through lower turnover, higher productivity, better customer service, and higher sales. The better treatment of employees leads to loyal, long-term staff and happy customers. 

Many companies were negatively impacted by the 2008 recession, including The Container Store, which saw a 13% drop in sales. To cut costs, they froze wages and stopped matching 401(k) contributions. However, employees voluntarily found ways to save the company money, like downgrading travel expenses. The company's good treatment of employees over the years led the staff to rally together to help in hard times.

In contrast, Rick Fox, who was in charge of Shell's URSA offshore oil platform, had a "tough guy" management style and was intolerant of weakness. He cared most about safety and maximizing oil production. However, Shell hired Claire Nuer, a management consultant, to help improve team dynamics before the launch of the URSA platform. At first, the crew resented the time spent on her team-building workshop, but it ended up helping them work together in a crisis.

Companies that treat their employees well and build a culture of trust and shared purpose tend to have employees that voluntarily go above and beyond to help the organization succeed, especially in difficult times. This leads to greater resilience and long-term success.

 

• Claire Nuer, a leadership consultant, proposed an unconventional solution to improve safety and performance on Shell's URSA oil rig: helping crew members express their feelings and become more vulnerable with each other. 

• Rick Fox, the rig manager, was initially skeptical but agreed to try Nuer's approach after attending one of her workshops improved his relationship with his son.

• Over the course of a year, Nuer guided the URSA crew through exercises where they shared personal stories, admitted mistakes and weaknesses, and gave each other feedback. This helped build trust and psychological safety within the team.

• The results were remarkable. The URSA had one of the best safety records in the industry and outperformed production goals. As Nuer's techniques spread through Shell, accidents declined 84% company-wide.

• While the idea of vulnerability and expressing emotions can be off-putting, especially in male-dominated cultures, it is essential for building high-performing teams. Leaders need to help their people feel psychologically safe to admit mistakes, ask for help, and share concerns.

• The Navy SEALs evaluate candidates based on both performance (technical competence) and trust (character and how they treat teammates). The ideal team member ranks highly on both scales. Low performers who are also untrustworthy should be avoided.

• Trust is the foundation for performance. When people feel safe being vulnerable with each other, information flows freely, problems get solved, and the team can achieve at a high level. But trust cannot be mandated - it grows through small moments of reciprocal vulnerability over time.

• Leaders often resist building trust and psychological safety, believing their role is to drive performance, not make people feel good. But there is no separating emotions from work. The healthiest teams acknowledge feelings and use them to build connections. With trust, performance follows.

 

- The SEALs value trust over performance. They found that high performers who have low trustworthiness (“toxic” team members) negatively impact team dynamics. 
- Business culture often overly values high performance. Leaders like Jack Welch focused on performance metrics and internal competition at the expense of trust and teamwork. 
- Although high performance is easy to measure, trustworthiness is harder to quantify. However, toxic team members are easy to identify - just ask others who the “asshole” is. Trusted team members may not be the highest performers but help the team overall.
- Good leaders evaluate whether underperforming or untrustworthy team members can improve with coaching before removing them. They aim to develop skills and build trust so each team member can contribute fully. 
- The story of Officer Jake Coyle illustrates how lack of trust and psychological safety harmed workplace culture. His colleagues ostracized and bullied him, and he wanted to leave. 
- When Jack Cauley became the new police chief, he found a culture focused on metrics and obedience over trust and support. He held listening sessions and built a new culture of trust, valuing officers’ input and wellbeing.

In summary, while high performance is important, trust and team dynamics are even more critical for success. Toxic behaviors and culture can seriously damage organizations even if some high performers are achieving results. Good leadership, coaching, and a culture of trust and psychological safety are needed to enable sustainable high performance.

 

- The parking lot at the Castle Rock Police Department headquarters felt unsafe for staff and officers at night. For years, management ignored their concerns.
- When Chief Cauley took over, he built a "Circle of Safety" by erecting a fence around the parking lot. This showed staff he cared about their wellbeing. 
- Cauley gave Problem Officer Jake Coyle a second chance instead of firing him. He told Coyle he believed in him and Coyle was determined to prove himself. 
- Cauley coached and supported Coyle. Coyle took responsibility for his actions and the department's culture transformed. Coyle became one of the most trusted officers.
- People act from fear instead of confidence when they feel unsafe. This leads to poor decision making and avoiding the truth. 
- When Alan Mulally took over as Ford CEO, executives were afraid to admit problems and hid the truth. Mulally introduced weekly business plan reviews but executives only reported "green" statuses.  
- Mulally persisted in asking for the truth. Finally, Mark Fields showed a "red" status and Mulally supported him. Other executives then felt safe to report problems. 
- Mulally depersonalized problems, telling executives "you have a problem, you are not the problem". He could then support them properly.  
- Once the Circle of Safety was built, the executives worked as a team to improve statuses. Honesty and support are needed for high performance. Leaders must model this behavior.

 

- Culture is defined as values plus behavior. To build a culture of trust requires work. It starts by creating a psychologically safe environment where people feel comfortable being themselves. 

- Chief Cauley transformed the Castle Rock Police Department by focusing on trust and performance over metrics. He changed the evaluation and recognition systems to focus on problem-solving, impact, and community trust.

- Officers are now given more discretion and freedom to solve problems. They take initiative to build community trust through programs like “Dirt, Jumps and Doughnuts” where officers ride bikes and share donuts with local kids. 

- The department takes a “one-by-one policing” approach, solving problems incrementally through consistent action over intensity. For example, instead of raiding an alleged drug house, officers increased neighborhood presence, and the tenants left. This approach is better suited for the “infinite game” of policing.

- Focusing on internal culture and trust has improved officer morale, judgment, and community trust. Anecdotally, the community shows more appreciation and willingness to cooperate. Chief Cauley sees the department as “problem solvers” not “enforcers.”

- The Castle Rock model could work for other small police departments struggling with trust and community issues. While more work is needed, the culture is significantly healthier. 

- In any field, an overemphasis on metrics and short-term thinking can damage long-term performance, employee trust and willingness. This applies to both policing and business.

 

- Ethical fading occurs when people act unethically while believing they have not compromised their morals. It often starts small but grows over time.

- Organizations focused on short-term results are particularly prone to ethical fading. They intensely pressure people to meet targets, even if it means cutting corners. Those who do so are rewarded, sending the message that results matter more than ethics.

- People rationalize unethical behavior to mitigate guilt. Common rationalizations include: "I have to provide for my family," "It's what management wants," "I have no choice," and "Everyone else does it."  

- Our ability for rational thought allows ethical fading. We make sense of unethical acts by coming up with justifications for them. Over time, these rationalizations become normal and we become desensitized to the unethical behavior.

- To prevent ethical fading, organizations must:

› Focus on building an ethical culture, not just meeting targets. Reward integrity, not just results.  

› Leaders must model ethical behavior and call out unethical acts when they see them. They shape culture through their words and actions.

› Foster open communication. Create an environment where people feel safe speaking up about ethical concerns without fear of retaliation.  

› Provide ethics training. Help employees develop a sensitivity to ethical issues and give them the tools to navigate them.  

› Review incentive systems. Make sure they don't disproportionately reward unethical behavior or overemphasize short term results over ethics.

› Conduct audits. Put systems in place to detect unethical behavior, not just illegal acts. Take action when unethical behavior is found.

› Consider how new policies or incentives might lead to unethical behavior before implementing them. Unintended consequences are common without ethical review.

That covers the key points around ethical fading and how to prevent it. Let me know if you would like me to explain anything in the summary in more detail.

 

- We have an innate capacity for rationalization that allows us to justify unethical behavior to avoid guilt. This can lead to a snowball effect where unethical behavior becomes widespread in an organization.  

- A 1973 study found that pressure and incentives can negatively impact ethics. When seminary students were put under time pressure, far fewer stopped to help someone in distress. Employees at Wells Fargo were under extreme pressure to meet sales quotas, leading them to open fake accounts.

- Ethical fading happens gradually over time, not suddenly. Wells Fargo had warnings about its toxic culture and unethical practices for over a decade but failed to act. Leadership knew about issues as early as 2002 but did nothing. They resisted oversight and scrutiny.

- The unethical practices were widespread throughout Wells Fargo, not just in retail banking. The company faced issues in its auto loans, wholesale banking, and mortgage lending as well.

- Though Wells Fargo was fined $185 million, it was a tiny fraction of their profits and revenue. No individuals were held criminally liable or even indicted. Executives like the CEO left with huge payouts, showing there were few consequences for overseeing the unethical culture.

- The case of Mylan increasing the price of EpiPens shows how incentives and a drive for profits can lead to unethical behavior. Mylan raised the price of the essential drug by 500% over 6 years. The CEO showed no remorse, blaming "the system." Bonuses of up to $100 million for executives drove these price hikes.

- The summary outlines how rationalization, pressure, incentives, and a slow descent into unethical behavior over time can negatively impact organizations and create harmful cultures. Lack of consequences and accountability allows these practices to spread.

 

- Accountability means taking responsibility for one's own actions, not blaming external factors.
- The CEO of Mylan denied wrongdoing and blamed the healthcare system for EpiPen price hikes. 
- Self-deception allows people to rationalize unethical behavior. 
- Euphemistic language can distance people from the impact of unethical actions. For example, "enhanced interrogation" vs. torture. 
- Blaming external factors, like "the system," allows people to avoid responsibility. For example, blaming consumers for choices under "caveat emptor."
- Fulfilling legal obligations does not release companies from ethical responsibility. For example, tech companies are partially responsible for addictive products, even if use is legally consented to.
- The "slippery slope" allows unethical behavior to gradually become more severe as norms change. Incremental changes at Mylan led to massive price hikes. 
- An excessive focus on "the finite game" and performance metrics can lead to ignoring ethical issues. Mylan executives probably focused on bonuses from price hikes.
- Mylan and Wells Fargo show extreme examples of ethical fading for instructive purposes. But ethical fading is common, in tricks like complex rebates, creative accounting, and exaggerating health benefits.

 

• Ethical fading refers to engaging in unethical behavior while believing we are acting ethically. It often stems from self-delusion and rationalization. 

• Ethical fading is very common and can happen in any organization. It is hard to reverse once it takes hold.

• Finite-minded leaders often apply finite solutions like excessive rules, process and bureaucracy to fix ethical fading. But this approach does not work and often makes the problem worse.

• Excessive process and demands can pressure people into lying and cheating while still believing they have high integrity. This was seen in a study of the U.S. Army.

• “Lazy Leadership” refers to leaders who rely on process rather than building support for their people. Process seems objective but often just tells leaders what they want to hear.

• An infinite mindset is the best way to prevent and fix ethical fading. Giving people a meaningful purpose and trusting them to advance it leads to a culture where people naturally consider ethics and impact.

• Ethical fading happens because of self-delusion, not because people have bad moral compasses. Anyone in any role can succumb to ethical fading without realizing it.

• Public scandals often expose ethical fading but a spotlight alone does not fix the underlying issues. Deep cultural change is required. Leaders must understand the root causes that enabled the unethical behavior.

• Promises to fix culture are easily made but hard to fulfill. Ethical fading is difficult to reverse, especially using a finite approach. Infinite solutions that transform mindsets and purpose are required.

That covers the key highlights and main takeaways from the summary on ethical fading. Please let me know if you would like me to explain or expand on any part of the summary.

 

- When people feel part of a trusting team working towards a shared purpose or cause, they feel a sense of accountability to their teammates and the organization. They want to meet high ethical standards and make their leaders proud. 

- As social animals, people tend to act in accordance with the norms and standards of their environment and culture. Put someone in an environment with high ethical standards, and they will act ethically. Put them in an environment where ethical standards have faded, and they become susceptible to ethical lapses. Leaders shape culture, so they are responsible for ethical standards.

- Creating an ethical culture requires hard work, patience, devotion to a cause, and nurturing trusting teams. It can take a long time, but must then be vigilantly guarded. Ethical lapses happen, but ethical fading is a leadership failure and can be controlled.

- Patagonia took out an ad telling people not to buy their jacket due to its environmental impact. They aim to make high-quality, long-lasting products that cause minimal environmental harm. They admit their imperfections but are constantly trying to improve to work towards their cause.

- Patagonia goes out of its way to close loopholes and improve ethical standards in its supply chain. It even audits second-tier suppliers, which most companies don’t do. Rooting out forced labor is difficult but Patagonia is committed to constant improvement and ethical action in pursuing its cause.

- Finite-minded companies may worry that Patagonia's approach could hurt profits or reputation. But as a private company, Patagonia has more freedom and is willing to take big risks to work towards its purpose. Its approach builds trust in the brand and inspires employees and customers.

The key ideas are: culture shapes behavior; leadership shapes culture; and a devotion to purpose inspires constant improvement and high ethical standards. Patagonia demonstrates these principles in action through its business practices and supply chain efforts.

 

- Public companies are driven to maximize short-term profits to please shareholders. Patagonia, as a certified B Corp, aims to balance profits with social impact.
- Though Patagonia is a for-profit business, they see making money as a means to achieving their greater purpose of environmental and social good. 
- To be certified as a B Corp, companies must formally commit to social and environmental values and responsibilities, not just maximizing shareholder profits. 
- Patagonia believes that upholding these values and responsibilities will drive long-term business success. By focusing on purpose over profits, Patagonia has seen major growth.
- Patagonia aims to set an example for other companies in how to "do business differently" - in a way that contributes value to society and the environment. 
- There is a point at which Patagonia's growth may create more problems than solutions. Patagonia is thinking about how to address this. 
- The author discusses his experience of seeing a colleague as a competitor, which made him feel insecure and envious. He realized this view said more about his own weaknesses than about the colleague.
- In an infinite game, other players should be seen as Worthy Rivals, not competitors. Worthy Rivals are respected players from whom we can learn. 
- Choosing Worthy Rivals strategically and focusing on self-improvement, not winning, leads to greater resilience and innovation. Obsessing over beating competitors can stifle growth.
- Worthy Rivals push us in a way a coach cannot and elevate our game. For example, tennis players Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova made each other better players through their rivalry.
- Seeing strong players as Worthy Rivals, not competitors, helps keep us focused on ethics and the reason we are in the game. Obsessing over winning can lead to "cheating" and harm.

 

- When we view competitors as Worthy Rivals rather than adversaries to defeat, it removes the pressure to win at all costs and act unethically. We focus more on upholding our values. 
- The author originally saw Adam Grant as a competitor but shifted to seeing him as a Worthy Rival. This helped the author focus on advancing their shared cause rather than comparing rankings. They became friends and want each other to succeed. In infinite games, multiple players can succeed. 
- When Alan Mulally became Ford's CEO, he admitted a Lexus was the finest car, showing Ford's products needed improvement. He had executives drive rivals' cars to learn from them, not just outsell them. Mulally saw Toyota as a Worthy Rival that Ford could learn from to improve. 
- During the financial crisis, Mulally could have pushed for GM and Chrysler to fail but instead endorsed bailing them out. He knew their survival helped suppliers and Ford. Ford's rivals were part of the broader ecosystem. Infinite leaders aim to keep the game in play.
- In the early 1980s, Apple's rival IBM helped clarify Apple's cause and rally people. IBM's entry into personal computers reminded people why Apple existed - to be pirates disrupting established players like IBM, "the navy." 
- Rather than panic at IBM's arrival, Apple welcomed them to show they were not intimidated. Apple remained dedicated to giving individuals the power to be creative. IBM's actions reaffirmed Apple's cause and spirit. Rivals can strengthen our dedication.

So in summary, viewing competitors as Worthy Rivals helps leaders and organizations uphold values, learn and improve, clarify their cause, and strengthen dedication. It leads to a healthier, more ethical, and more purposeful competition.

 

- Apple welcomed IBM into the personal computer market in a full-page ad in 1981. Rather than viewing IBM as a competitor, Apple saw them as a “Worthy Rival” that could help advance their shared cause of increasing access to technology. 

- IBM’s dominance in the business market allowed them to sell personal computers to large companies, making IBM the safe and obvious choice for most buyers. IBM’s decision to allow other companies to clone their operating system led to the PC becoming the industry standard.

- While IBM helped popularize personal computers, Apple used them as a foil to clarify what they stood for: individuality, creativity, and thinking differently. To followers, IBM represented the past while Apple represented the future. This turned the competition into a “game of religion.”

- Normally, incumbents panic when a strong new player enters their market. But Apple responded differently by viewing IBM as a Worthy Rival rather than a competitor. In contrast, BlackBerry viewed the iPhone as a competitor and lost sight of their vision in an effort to copy Apple. Their decline highlights the dangers of a finite mindset.

- Worthy Rivals help leaders clarify their cause by providing an ideological contrast. As technology changed, Apple found new Worthy Rivals in Microsoft, Google, and Facebook. But “Cause Blindness”—losing sight of others’ strengths and your own weaknesses—blunts learning and growth. The author cautions against dismissing players you disagree with as “unworthy of comparison.”

- In summary, having Worthy Rivals aids vision and purpose but requires leaders to maintain an open and humble mindset. Copying competitors is a finite game that often ends badly.

 

- Worthy Rivals push us to constantly improve. Having strong rivals is in our best interest, even if we disagree with them.

- Declaring victory when a rival drops out of the game is a mistake. In infinite games, there is no winning. New rivals will emerge. 

- After the Soviet Union collapsed, the U.S. suffered from "cause blindness" and acted without restraint. It failed to identify new rivals and neglected weaknesses.

- There are three tensions governing the Cold War: nuclear, ideological, and economic. During Cold War 1.0, the Soviet Union represented all three. Now, in Cold War 2.0, there are many rivals across these tensions, like China, North Korea, extremists, and Russia.

- Failing to adapt to new rivals can lead to downfall, as seen with Blockbuster, publishers, taxi companies, Sears, and Myspace. Without strong rivals, infinite players risk losing humility, agility, and purpose.

- The key message is that we must continuously identify and learn from our rivals to avoid stagnation and stay sharp. Strong rivals push us outside our comfort zone and force us to grow.

 

- Walt Disney was an innovative leader who was accustomed to taking risks and advancing his “Just Cause” of transporting people to idyllic worlds through his art and imagination. 
- Disney’s Just Cause was inspired by fond memories of his childhood in Marceline, Missouri.
- As Walt Disney Productions grew into a successful company, Disney became frustrated with the increasing bureaucracy and restrictions. He felt the company could no longer effectively advance his Just Cause.
- In 1952, Disney made an “Existential Flex” - he liquidated his assets, quit Walt Disney Productions, and started over with a new company called WED to build Disneyland. 
- Disneyland was a place where people could fully immerse themselves in a perfect illusion and escape everyday life, advancing Disney’s Just Cause.
- An Existential Flex is an extreme disruption initiated by an infinite-minded leader to better advance their Just Cause. It requires vision, flexibility, and a willingness to take risks. 
- Existential Flexibility recreates the passion of a startup and rejuvenates leaders and followers. It happens when a company is already successful, not at its founding. 
- To outsiders, an Existential Flex seems “existential” or risky. But to the infinite-minded leader, it is necessary to advance their vision and Cause.

The key themes are Walt Disney’s vision and passion for advancing his Just Cause, his frustration with the restrictions of his own successful company, his bold Existential Flex to start over and build Disneyland, and the attributes of Existential Flexibility as a concept.

 

- Existential flexibility refers to making a major shift in strategy to advance one's cause or purpose. Infinite-minded leaders are willing to take this risk, even if it disrupts their current business model. Finite-minded leaders are reluctant to make such a shift because it threatens their current profits and stability. 

- Leaders like Alan Mulally and Steve Jobs made existential flexes by looking outside their industries for new ideas and opportunities to advance their vision. Though risky, their employees trusted these leaders' judgment. In contrast, "shiny-object syndrome" refers to chasing every new idea without a clear vision or purpose.

- In the early 1980s, Steve Jobs insisted that Apple invest in developing a graphical user interface, even though it meant abandoning their current work and destabilizing the company. Jobs believed this was necessary to empower individuals through personal computing. The Macintosh resulted and revolutionized the industry.

- George Eastman founded Kodak to make photography accessible to average people. Kodak went on to make many innovations advancing this vision. However, when Kodak engineers invented the first digital camera, executives lacked Eastman's vision. They stuck to their current business model based on film and paper, fearing digital photography would threaten profits. Lacking a sense of purpose, they failed to see how digital could advance their original cause.

- The key message is that infinite-minded leaders, guided by a clear vision and purpose, are willing to disrupt their companies and take existential risks in order to advance their cause. Finite-minded leaders are too focused on near-term stability and profits to make major strategic shifts, even if the status quo ultimately threatens the organization. Vision and purpose are required to navigate disruptive change.

 Summary: Kodak’s executives lacked the vision and courage to transition the company to digital photography. They were focused on short-term gains and keeping shareholders happy instead of the company’s long-term vision. When digital photography eventually disrupted the film industry, Kodak was unprepared and went bankrupt.

In contrast, CVS showed courage and vision when it stopped selling cigarettes to align with its purpose of helping people become healthier. Despite short-term revenue losses and criticism, the decision strengthened CVS’s brand, opened up new partnerships, and contributed to an overall drop in cigarette sales. CVS’s choice demonstrated its commitment to the infinite game and helping society in the long run.

 

- Wall Street and shareholders primarily care about short-term gains and metrics like quarterly earnings. But employees and customers care more about the long-term success and purpose of a company. Loyal employees and customers tend to drive more success and shareholder benefit. 

- CVS's decision to stop selling cigarettes provides an example. Analysts predicted a drop in stock price, and it did fall initially. But in the long run, the stock price doubled as the company became more successful. Key metrics like earnings per share also rose substantially.

- Adopting an infinite mindset focused on long-term purpose can be risky in a world obsessed with short-term gains. Leaders face immense pressure to prioritize the short-term. It takes courage to ignore that and focus on the long game.

- There are two ways to develop an infinite mindset: 1) A life-changing experience that shifts your perspective. 2) Find a meaningful purpose and community of like-minded people to motivate you. The second approach offers more control and simply requires faith, discipline, and practice.

- Doug Parker, CEO of American Airlines, provides an example of finding purpose. After 9/11, the company was struggling and Parker felt like a failure. But after talking to a flight attendant named Mary, he realized how much the airline's survival meant to her and others. This gave him the motivation and passion to fight for a government loan and eventually merge the company to ensure its success. 

- However, after achieving stability, Parker again felt aimless. He realized that giving employees job security was a milestone, but not an infinite purpose that could drive him for life. After learning about a CEO focused on employee well-being, Parker determined that creating an environment where employees feel cared for should be his higher purpose. This could motivate him and the company for the long run.

- In summary, short-term pressures are immense, but true success and motivation come from focusing on long-term purpose that serves others. Finding the courage and community to adopt an infinite mindset is challenging but can lead to greater impact and fulfillment.

 

- Doug Parker, CEO of American Airlines, shifted the company to an infinite mindset by focusing on people over numbers. 

- The previous leadership had violated employee trust and negotiated wage cuts while protecting executive pay. Parker aimed to rebuild trust.

- In 2015, American negotiated higher pay for pilots and flight attendants. But competitors then offered even higher pay, leaving American employees behind.

- Rather than wait until the next contract, Parker gave employees mid-contract raises of 5-8% at a cost of $900 million, to demonstrate trustworthiness.

- Wall Street analysts criticized the move, saying labor was paid "first again" and shareholders got "leftovers." American's stock dropped 9% but recovered.

- Parker said they have to ignore short-term chatter and focus on long-term goals. Caring for employees leads to caring for customers and shareholder value.

- American is attracting more long-term investors like Berkshire Hathaway, which rarely sells investments. Berkshire is now American's largest shareholder.

- CVS showed courage by removing cigarettes to match its purpose. Walgreens and Rite Aid say health is a priority but still sell cigarettes, lacking conviction.  

- Smoking causes more U.S. deaths than HIV, drugs, alcohol, etc.combined. Walgreens

 

- Cigarette smoking kills 480,000 people annually in the US which is more than the number of US military deaths in WW2. 
- Smoking-related healthcare costs US taxpayers over $300 billion each year which is nearly 50 times the entire cost of the NASA space shuttle program over 30 years.
- 70% of smokers want to quit but struggle to do so. Removing cigarettes from stores could help make quitting easier. 
- Leaders and companies should act with integrity by doing what they say and living up to their purpose and mission. If they don't, their statements are just empty marketing.
- When companies justify unethical actions by saying they are legal, it shows a lack of integrity and trustworthiness.
- True leadership requires courage to do the right thing, not just follow the law. It means words and actions align. 
- Integrity means acting before public outcry, not just reacting to scandals. Waiting for opinions shows lack of courage.
- Even with success, infinite-minded leaders stay focused on their cause. Finite leaders play defense and chase domination and profits. 
- Disney, Microsoft and Walmart strayed from their infinite paths at times but new CEOs helped get them back on track.
- Events like leadership changes or IPOs can force companies to choose finite or infinite paths. But straying from an infinite path is common as people constantly stray from their own paths.

In summary, strong and courageous leadership focused on purpose and integrity is key to overcoming humanity's imperfections and keeping organizations on the path to serving their cause in an ethical, trustworthy way.

 

- Organizations often stray from a healthy path when leaders become more interested in themselves than the organization's purpose or "Cause." Leaders start believing their own hype and thinking the company's success was due to them, not their people. 

- Management becomes disconnected from employees, trust breaks down, and performance suffers. To "fix" things, leaders rely more on processes than people. The company becomes rigid and decision making is taken from those on the front lines.

- Facebook started with the infinite purpose of "giving people the power to build community and bring the world closer together." Now it's accused of privacy violations, tracking users, and maximizing ad revenue. Facebook may have veered off course due to pressure to please Wall Street, over-reliance on ads, leaders losing sight of the Cause, or hubris. Facebook only acted on scandals after public outcry, not proactively. They seem to have a more finite mindset now.

- Companies like Microsoft, Walmart, and Disney have veered off course but found their way back. Not all companies can afford to veer off for long. Infinite leadership - purpose, trust, accountability, service - helps stay the course.

- Admitting failure and changing one's mindset requires courage, especially when many choices will be bad. But finding others who share beliefs and responsibility makes courage possible. Courageous leaders know they don't have all the answers but have each other and a Cause. Weak leaders think they control all and have all the answers.

- Our lives are finite but life continues infinitely. We can choose a finite mindset - focused on beating others  - or an infinite one - advancing a Cause bigger than ourselves, building trust, helping others rise. Parenting, careers, friendships, creativity are infinite games too. A finite parenting approach pushes kids to always be the best. An infinite approach helps them discover passions, values service, builds trust and accountability.

 

- Living an infinite life and developing an infinite mindset means thinking long-term, considering how our actions today will impact the future, and focusing on continuous learning and growth.  
- Infinite games, like life, have no fixed rules or timelines. The goal is to perpetuate the game, not win it.
- Leaders and brands playing the infinite game are focused on serving others, not beating competitors. Their purpose is to inspire people and make a positive impact.  
- Finite games are played to win according to fixed rules. Players are concerned primarily with their opponents and coming out on top. This mindset leads to short-term thinking and limits growth and progress.
- Successful brands playing the infinite game, like Apple, LEGO, and Victorinox, have a clear purpose and vision beyond increasing profits. They aim to meaningfully serve customers and society over the long run. 
- Teaching children an infinite mindset and preparing them for continuous learning and growth is one of the greatest contributions we can make. Our education and development never stop. 
- When we live with an infinite mindset, we think about how our decisions today will impact others far into the future. We aim to serve and make a lasting positive difference. Life becomes less about individual gain or victory and more about perpetuating progress.

The key message is that adopting an infinite mindset focused on purpose, growth, and serving others leads to greater long-term success, progress, and impact. We should aim to inspire future generations and make decisions that positively shape the future. Life is a game meant to perpetuate, not win.

 

Over the last five years of Steve Ballmer’s tenure as CEO, Microsoft lost its way and momentum. It became obsessed with competition and missed big technology shifts. 

According to studies, most big companies don't last longer than 40-50 years. Professor Richard Foster says companies have a "mortality rate" of over 99% over a 50-year period. After the 1929 crash, new regulations gave companies more stability but also allowed inefficient companies to last longer.

Successful companies need a strong sense of purpose - a "Just Cause" - to help guide them over the long term. For example, the Russian botanist Nikolai Vavilov was motivated by ending famine and building seed banks. 

Without a strong purpose or mission, companies drift and struggle. They go into "survival mode" with no long term vision. Startups also need purpose to drive them through the challenges of scaling up. 

A leader's key job is to be a "keeper of the cause" - to clearly articulate and reinforce the company's purpose and mission. When Mike Duke passed the reins to Doug McMillon at Walmart, McMillon pledged to re-instill Sam Walton's original mission.

There is debate over the responsibility of business. Milton Friedman argued that the only responsibility of business is to maximize profits. But others argue that business relies on healthy societies and environments, so it must consider its impact and role in social issues. The financial crisis showed how business can negatively impact society if unchecked.

Transforming a company requires will and resources. Resources without will are useless, just as will without resources is futile. Apple retail chief Angela Ahrendts built will by paying employees well and focusing on their passion. Walmart is trying to do the same.

Building strong, trusting teams is essential for any leader or company. Psychological safety - the ability to be vulnerable without fear of being punished - is key. General Stanley McChrystal focused on "team of teams" and learning to trust others. Alan Mulally helped turn around Ford by building trust and "working together as a team."

Ethical fading - the slow normalization of unethical behavior over time - is a risk for any company. The 2016 Wells Fargo scandal showed how leadership and incentives led to major ethical fading and fraud over many years without proper oversight or consequence.

 

An internal investigation found that senior executives at Wells Fargo, including former CEO John Stumpf, were aware of the unauthorized accounts scandal years before it became public. Stumpf lost his job and had to repay $134 million. Other executives were also fired and had pay claws back. The scandal damaged Wells Fargo’s reputation and cost it billions in fines and settlements. 

At the pharmaceutical company Mylan, CEO Heather Bresch tied executive pay to aggressive profit targets. The company raised the price of EpiPens over 15 times, making an EpiPen two-pack cost over $600. Mylan falsely claimed it was losing money on EpiPens to justify price hikes. The company paid $465 million to settle claims it overcharged Medicaid. Experts say the scandal shows how unethical behavior can start small but spread in companies.

Patagonia, an outdoor gear company, has successfully built a culture of social responsibility and environmental stewardship. The company is driven by its vision to make high-quality and sustainable products, using renewable energy and recyclable materials. Patagonia has encouraged customers not to buy new products unless necessary. The company received certifcation as a B Corp, meeting high standards of social and environmental performance. Patagonia’s CEO says its mission has boosted growth.

The rivalry between tennis players Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova was built on mutual respect and constant self-improvement. They made each other better players, similar to how corporate rivals can drive innovation. Under CEO Alan Mulally, Ford improved by focusing on its own processes rather than worrying about market share relative to rivals GM and Chrysler. Mulally helped Ford avoid bankruptcy during the financial crisis.

Walt Disney overcame failures and tragedies to build one of the world's most successful media and entertainment companies. Like other “infinite companies,” Disney has shown existential flexibility—the ability to reinvent itself through creativity and risk taking. In contrast, companies like Kodak failed to adapt to change and went bankrupt.

CVS Health stopped selling tobacco products in 2014 to align its brand with health. The move cost CVS $2 billion in annual revenue but strengthened its reputation. CVS’ CEO argued that selling tobacco undermined the company’s purpose. The decision showed courage and long-term thinking, even though critics predicted it would hurt the stock price.

 

- CVS's decision to stop selling tobacco products in 2014 was met with mixed reactions. Some applauded the health-conscious move while others criticized the potential loss of revenue and customer inconvenience. 
- An internal study found that the tobacco ban led some customers to quit smoking. CVS's revenue and stock price initially dropped but then rebounded. 
- Companies like Irwin Naturals filled the shelf space vacated by tobacco products. CVS has since renovated many stores to focus on health and wellness.
- Despite calls to follow CVS's lead, competitors like Walgreens and Rite Aid continue to sell tobacco products due to perceived customer demand and revenue benefits. However, smoking causes over $300 billion in annual health care costs and nearly half a million deaths per year in the U.S.
- Doug Parker, CEO of American Airlines, aims to create a customer-focused company culture and avoid past mistakes that led to executive scandal and bankruptcy. By investing in employees, American Airlines has become very profitable. However, some analysts criticize the wage increases and bonuses given to executives.
- Most companies wait to take a stance on social issues until public opinion has clearly shifted to avoid backlash and controversy. CVS chose to stop selling tobacco products before a majority of Americans supported such a ban.
- James P. Carse defined "finite" and "infinite" games. Finite games have fixed rules and endpoints, while infinite games continue the play. Most companies operate with a finite mindset focused on quarterly results and shareholder value. But some companies like CVS and Disney tap into a sense of infinite purpose.
- Walt Disney overcame a difficult start and financial struggles to build an entertainment empire based on storytelling and experience. His "infinite" vision and perseverance created a legacy that lives on today.

 Here’s a summary of the page:

- The section covers a wide range of topics related to business, leadership, and society. Some of the major themes include:

- Having an “infinite mindset” focused on purpose and long-term thinking rather than short-term gains. This leads to more innovation, resilience, and ethics. 

- Defining a company’s “Just Cause” - its vision and reason for being beyond profits. A good Just Cause is idealistic, inclusive, resilient, and service-oriented. Leaders must communicate it to inspire others.

- Building “Trusting Teams” through vulnerability, honesty, and a focus on purpose over performance metrics. This leads to a healthy company culture where people feel safe and motivated.

- Learning the skill of “Worthy Rivals” - choosing competitors that push you to improve rather than enemies to defeat. But be wary of losing a Worthy Rival or gaining one focused only on victory. 

- Many business concepts and leaders are referenced as examples, both positive and negative, such as infinite games, stakeholder capitalism, Alan Mulally, John Stumpf, and Kip Tindell.

- Historical and cultural references provide context, including the founding of America, the siege of Leningrad, the Vietnam War, and the civil rights movement.

- The section ends emphasizing that business is an infinite game, where the goal should be long-term progress rather than defeating others. With the right mindset and values, business can drive positive change.

That covers the essence and main takeaways from the summary. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.
