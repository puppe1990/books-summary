- The narrator recalls a happy memory of spending time with his family at Balmoral Castle in Scotland during the summer of 1997. He was there with his grandmother, grandfather, brother William, and father. His mother was on holiday elsewhere, apparently with a new “friend.” 

- The narrator remembers a recent fun trip to St. Tropez with his mother and brother. During that trip, his mother’s new friend appeared and gave her an expensive gift, a diamond bracelet. The narrator and his brother were okay with this, as long as their mother was happy.

- Going from the sunny south of France to the chilly Scottish Highlands was an abrupt change. The narrator’s first week at Balmoral was likely spent mostly outside. His family liked outdoor pursuits like fishing, shooting, walking, and riding. 

- The narrator recalls August 30, 1997 as a particularly happy day. The weather was nice, and he went walking with his brother and father. Though they didn’t always get along, on this day they seemed to be in agreement and enjoying each other’s company. However, the narrator felt a “keen poignance” during their walk, aware of the fragility of this moment.

- The walk ended at the Royal Burial Ground, where many royals were buried. The narrator’s father and brother then confronted him about why he had left. The narrator tried to explain but found himself unable to fully tell them the reasons. His brother claimed not to know why the narrator left. Stunned, the narrator realized his family may never have truly known or understood him. Though upset, he resolved to tell them the truth another day.

- The narrator reflects that there were always “stories” about Balmoral, indicating its surreal and strange nature. However, as a child he had seen it as an idyllic place, like Paradise. Now he recognizes a “poignance” and sadness there too.



 

- The narrator has strong memories of the physical spaces in Balmoral Castle, including vivid descriptions of the entrance, hall, grand staircase, and bedrooms. However, the narrator has trouble remembering specific dates, events, or conversations from that time. 

- The narrator suggests that this tendency to remember spaces over events could be due to genetics, trauma, a combination of factors, a desire to assess spaces tactically, or a need to navigate the world. The narrator acknowledges that memory is subjective.

- The narrator describes in detail two second-floor rooms at Balmoral: the nursery, which the narrator shared with Prince William, and an adjacent round sitting room with an old-fashioned bathroom. The narrator recalls taking hot baths there while gazing out at the starry sky and perfect lawn. 

- On August 30, 1997, the narrator and Prince William hurried through their baths and evening meals to watch television. Footmen brought them trays of food to eat while watching TV.

The summary covers the key details about the narrator's spatial memory, rooms at Balmoral, bathing routine, and events of August 30, 1997. The level of detail is fairly high but focused on the essential points to convey a sense of the narrator's experiences there.

 

- The narrator describes eating dinner under a silver dome as a child with his brother at their grandmother's estate in Scotland. Their father, who they call Pa, comes to say goodnight before going down to a formal dinner. 

- The narrator describes going to bed in a four-poster bed. In the middle of the night, Pa comes in and tells the narrator that his mother, Mummy, has been in a car crash. Although Pa says she was taken to the hospital, she did not survive. The narrator does not cry upon hearing the news.

- The next morning, the narrator and his family go to church as usual. Afterward, they stop at the gates of the estate where people have left flowers and stuffed animals in condolence. The press is there taking photos of the narrator reaching for his father's hand.

- Pa leaves for Paris with Mummy's sisters to learn more about the crash and arrange for Mummy's body to be returned. The narrator continues to insist to himself that Mummy is not actually dead, that this is all a trick she has staged to escape her miserable life of being hounded by the press.

- The details given about the lavish estate, formal dinners, and royal family connections suggest the narrator comes from an aristocratic background. His mother seems to have been a public figure, hence the persistent attention from the paparazzi that contributed to her unhappiness.


 

- The narrator initially thinks his mother faked her own death as a diversion so she could run away and start a new life. He finds relief in this idea but also has doubts.

- The narrator's father and aunts return from Paris. His aunt gives him and his brother locks of hair as proof that their mother has really died. Though saddened, the narrator still holds onto the hope that she is alive. 

- The narrator and his brother greet crowds of mourners outside Kensington Palace. Though the crowds are emotional, the narrator struggles to cry. He questions how well the public really knew his mother.

- The narrator sees his mother's coffin draped in a Union Jack flag. He wonders about his mother's true feelings about Britain. He still hopes to see her again someday.

- The narrator and his brother are made to walk behind their mother's coffin during her funeral procession to garner public sympathy. Their uncle argues against making them do this but the narrator wants to support his brother. 

- During the funeral at Westminster Abbey, Elton John sings "Candle in the Wind" which nearly makes the narrator cry. His uncle delivers a eulogy condemning those responsible for his sister's death. The coffin is draped in the Royal Standard flag, indicating the Queen has forgiven the narrator's mother.

- The narrator continues to grapple with the reality of his mother's death.

 

- The narrator and his brother watched their mother’s funeral procession on TV. Her coffin was carried to a small island on their uncle’s estate and buried there. The narrator broke down crying at the burial, even though he told himself he didn’t actually believe his mother was in the coffin.  

- After the summer, the narrator returned to boarding school. He turned 13 shortly after and got an Xbox as a gift from his aunt, supposedly something his mother had bought for him before she died. The narrator’s memory of events around this time seems hazy.

- The boarding school was run largely by women called matrons, who acted as surrogate mothers to the boys. The narrator had crushes on some of the younger matrons. The matrons bathed the younger boys, helped them with lice infestations, and tucked them in at night. The narrator interacted frequently with a matron named Pat, who was strict and seemed to find little joy in life. The narrator and other boys would mock Pat, even though they knew she suffered from medical issues. Sometimes Pat would laugh along with their mocking.

- On certain days of the week, the boys would get candy and sweets at school. The narrator devised a way to maximize his sugar rush by mashing all his candy into one massive gumdrop and cramming it into his mouth.   

The summary covers the key details around the narrator dealing with his mother’s death, returning to school where matrons acted as surrogate mothers, interacting with and mocking the strict matron Pat, and enjoying candy and sweets on certain days at school.

 

The narrator describes having to write letters to his divorced parents as a child, which was difficult. After his mother disappeared, he had to write a “final” letter to her, though he wished he had expressed how much he loved her. 

The narrator then describes going on a trip to South Africa with his father, who wanted good publicity. The narrator attended a Spice Girls concert where he was bombarded by journalists. Though intimidated, he was glad to spend time with his mostly absent father. 

The next day, the narrator and his father went to a lodge where they listened to a historian describe the Anglo-Zulu war. Though the narrator was too young to fully understand, he was inspired by the stories of courage and British power. He felt the trip was a success and brought him closer to his father, though his life did not change much afterwards.

The key ideas are:

1) The narrator had a difficult relationship with his divorced parents, especially after his mother disappeared. 

2) The narrator’s father took him on a trip to South Africa for good publicity, though the narrator was mainly glad for time with his father.

3) The narrator was inspired by stories of the Anglo-Zulu war, though he was too young to fully grasp the nuances and criticism. 

4) The narrator hoped the trip would improve his relationship with his father, but his life remained mostly unchanged.

 

- The narrator describes some of his teachers at Ludgrove. Some, like Mr. Dawson and Mr. Little, were kind and understanding. However, his history teacher, Mr. Hughes-Games, frequently embarrassed him in class by quizzing him about his royal family’s history, even though the narrator had no interest in learning about it. The narrator eventually asked Mr. Hughes-Games to stop singling him out, and Mr. Hughes-Games apologized.  

- The narrator and his friend Henners would sometimes sneak out of their dorms at night and roam the school grounds. Once, they snuck onto a nearby farm and ate strawberries. They were caught by a teacher with strawberry stains on their hands. The narrator did not seem to mind the resulting punishment.

- Another teacher, Mr. Marston, frequently used a bell to try and get the boys’ attention during meals, but the boys ignored it due to the noise in the dining hall. The narrator found it absurd. 

- The narrator’s father once visited a psychiatric hospital and encountered a patient there who claimed to be the Prince of Wales. The narrator’s father joked that perhaps the real Prince of Wales was in the hospital, or that he himself was not really the narrator’s father. The narrator did not find this joke funny, given rumors at the time that his real father was Major James Hewitt.

In summary, the passage describes some of the narrator’s experiences with teachers and his father during his time at boarding school. Although some teachers were kind, his history teacher frequently embarrassed him, and his father made an insensitive joke referencing rumors about the narrator’s paternity.

 

- The press and public were delighted by the unfounded rumor that Prince Harry was not actually Prince Charles’s son. They found humor in mocking the young prince’s life. The story was frequently brought up even though it had been disproven. 

- Prince Harry’s mother, Princess Diana, said there were three people in her marriage, referring to Prince Charles’s mistress Camilla Parker Bowles. But Prince Harry and his brother Prince William were also affected by the problems in their parents’ marriage and their mother’s disappearance. 

- After Princess Diana’s disappearance, Prince Charles brought Prince William and Prince Harry together with Camilla Parker Bowles. The princes promised to accept Camilla into the family as long as Prince Charles did not marry her, fearing controversy and renewed press interest in Princess Diana. However, Camilla began a campaign to eventually marry Prince Charles and gain the crown. 

- Prince Harry found attending Eton College profoundly shocking. The rigorously academic environment was overwhelming for him, and he struggled to keep up. He asked to be placed in slower classes, but teachers and students assured him he would adjust. His brother Prince William asked him to pretend they did not know each other so Prince William could maintain the separate life he had built at Eton. Although they were in the same house, Prince William sought to avoid Prince Harry.

- Many of the other boys at Eton were as unwelcoming as Prince William. Prince Harry was unsettled by their ease and indifference in the environment, unlike his previous school where he had learned to navigate the space. At Eton, he felt like an outsider struggling to find his place.

The summary covers the key details around the rumors about Prince Harry’s paternity, his parents’ troubled marriage and mother’s disappearance, his difficult introduction to his father’s mistress, and his challenging transition to attending Eton College where he felt out of place. The details are condensed while retaining the overall sense and sequence of events.

 

- The narrator has started at Eton, an elite boarding school in England, after attending Ludgrove School. He finds the transition difficult, as the culture and rules at Eton are unfamiliar. He struggles to make friends and fit in.

- At Eton, students are required to wear formal attire and follow many traditions. The narrator finds some of these customs tedious and struggles to adjust. He throws himself into sports, especially rugby, to cope with the difficulties. 

- The narrator eventually makes some friends at Eton who treat him normally and don't draw attention to his royal status. They sometimes escape school to smoke cigarettes under a bridge. The narrator goes along with it to fit in, even though he's not really interested. 

- One day, the narrator's friends convince him to let one of them shave his head. He instantly regrets it when he sees his reflection and runs to his brother William's room for comfort. William just laughs at the narrator's mistake. 

- A tabloid newspaper publishes a story about the narrator's head shaving, calling him "Harry the Skinhead." They later publish another exaggerated story about him breaking his thumb, falsely reporting that he's seriously injured. The narrator is upset by the media's treatment of him. 

- The narrator reflects that the royal family used to be revered but are now treated like "insects" by the media, who manipulate and mock them for entertainment. The tabloid's writing and reporting are poor quality, showing a lack of care or ethics. The narrator struggles under the media's bullying at a vulnerable time in his life.

 

- The narrator recalls encountering a journalist whose writing he didn't think was very good. He can't remember the journalist's name now.

- As a teen, the narrator was labeled as the "naughty one" in the royal family. He didn't want to be seen that way but struggled in school, in part because of trouble concentrating due to grief over his mother's death. His father was disappointed in his lack of interest in education and literature. 

- The narrator did enjoy the novel Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck. He related to the story of friendship and loneliness. He wanted to share it with his brother William, who was ignoring him at the time.

- In 1999, when the narrator was on a school break, his father sent him and William on a safari in Botswana, led by a man named Marko. They were accompanied by their nanny, Tiggy. The Okavango Delta in Botswana, their destination, was filled with wildlife. 

- Upon arriving at their campsite in the Okavango Delta, they were greeted by many guides and trackers. The narrator lists some of their names.

The summary covers the key details around the naughty label given to the narrator, his struggles in school, enjoying the novel Of Mice and Men, going on a safari in Botswana, and arriving at the campsite. The journalist in the first paragraph is omitted from the summary given the lack of relevance to the rest of the details.

 

- The narrator describes Marko, one of the guides on the Botswana trip, as gregarious, loud, and always laughing. Marko has red hair and a big personality. The narrator wants to find a way to make Marko laugh.

- The narrator decides to play a prank by putting Tabasco sauce in Marko’s pudding. Before the prank can unfold, however, a leopard appears outside the dining tent, frightening everyone. The narrator walks toward the leopard, but Marko stops him. The adults realize the narrator was in danger and are alarmed at the thought of him being injured. The narrator thinks his mother may have sent the leopard as a sign. 

- The narrator reflects on the difference between the formal distance and lack of physical affection in the royal family versus the closeness of living things in Africa. In Africa, life is teeming all around. The narrator is in awe of all the animals, birds, insects, and the Okavango River itself.  

- Adi, one of the guides, teaches the narrator about the local wildlife and warns him about the dangers of the river, especially crocodiles and hippos. Around the campfire one night, the guides share stories about the river. The smell of marijuana arises, and the narrator asks to try some, bragging about his alcohol experience to convince the others.

 

- The narrator is a young royal who goes on hunting trips with various adults, including a woman named Tiggy. 

- On a trip to Norfolk, the narrator and his brother Willy often get into violent scraps with four other boys that result in injuries. The fights are partly make-believe battles but become increasingly dangerous, eventually involving firearms and explosives.

- On drives with just his brother and father, the narrator and Willy sometimes get into physical fights with each other. His father tends to punish the narrator without explanation. 

- On the narrator's first kill, a rabbit, Tiggy smears its blood on the narrator's face as a "blooding" ritual to mark his transition to becoming a "stalker."

- At age 15, the narrator goes deer stalking at Balmoral with an old guide named Sandy. After the narrator kills a stag with one shot, Sandy pushes the narrator's head inside its carcass, covering him in blood and viscera. Sandy says this is the "ultimate blooding."

- The narrator feels proud to have given the stag a quick, clean death that preserved its meat. He believes properly managing the deer population and providing food for the community are good things.

The passage gives a disturbing glimpse into the narrator's violent upbringing and his normalization of killing as a royal "sport." His desire to please the adults around him and achieve a sense of maturity seem to drive him to participate in these cruel practices without much protest.

 

- The narrator and his family are driving to the Balmoral estate in Scotland for the summer. 
- They pass by landmarks around the estate, including the home of the Queen Mother. 
- Once they are deep within the estate, the narrator is allowed to drive the car. They arrive at Inchnabobart Lodge, an old stone hunting lodge. 
- The narrator's great-grandmother, referred to as Gan-Gan, arrives for dinner. Despite being 101 years old, she is still sharp and joins the narrator in having a cocktail.
- The narrator and Gan-Gan have a deep conversation over dinner. The narrator wishes he had asked her more questions about her long, eventful life. She had been Queen during World War II, known Churchill, and lived through immense change. 
- Though Gan-Gan could seem unseemly or abrasive at times, the narrator loves her dearly, as does his father. The narrator is able to make Gan-Gan laugh during their conversation, pleasing his father.
- Overall, the passage focuses on the narrator's deep connection to his great-grandmother and his family's estate in Scotland. Though he doesn't fully appreciate it at the time, he is aware he is in the presence of living history.

 

The narrator's favorite person was his grandmother, whom he called Gan-Gan. He taught her phrases from popular culture, like "Booyakasha" from Ali G, just to make her laugh. Interacting with her and making her laugh made him feel included in his family in a way he usually didn't. 

Weeks later, the narrator was at school when the 9/11 terrorist attacks occurred. He and his classmates watched the news coverage in stunned silence, realizing the world they knew was changing. Shortly after, the narrator turned 17.

The narrator held out hope that his mother, who had been gone for four years, might return someday. He had recurring dreams that she would come back in disguise and reveal herself to him. Though part of him knew she was gone, part of him refused to believe it without concrete proof.

The narrator and his friends at Eton regularly smoked marijuana together in a small upstairs bathroom. They knew it was wrong but couldn't stop. One night while smoking, the narrator saw a fox outside and felt a strong connection with it, as if it had been sent as a messenger. 

When home from school, the narrator often hid away. He played video games for hours and hid in a basement area he and his friend Willy had dubbed "Club H." They and other friends would drink and listen to loud music there, though they avoided doing drugs. Club H provided the narrator solitude, mischief, and peace when he needed them.

 

- The tabloid editor who published false stories about Harry being a drug addict is referred to as “Rehabber Kooks.” Her stories caused embarrassment and heartbreak for Harry. 

- Princess Margaret, Harry’s great-aunt, was ill. Though they were related, Harry didn’t know her well and found her intimidating. During a Christmas gift exchange, Princess Margaret made a cutting remark that made clear her low opinion of Harry.

- Queen Elizabeth II, known to Harry as “Gan-Gan,” was also ill. Though reserved, she had always shown Harry love and support. Her illness and frailty saddened Harry.

- The royal family was no longer growing. There were no new marriages or babies on the horizon. A sense of stasis had set in, though this was interrupted by the illnesses of Princess Margaret and the Queen.

- Harry felt upset by the spin doctor’s strategy of throwing him “under the bus” to improve the reputation of Prince Charles. The stories published about Harry’s supposed drug use and rehab caused embarrassment for the royal family.

- Harry’s brother, William, known as “Willy,” offered sympathy and support. Though William was angry about how Harry was treated, he said there was nothing to be done. This was how royal life worked.

- A friend of Prince Charles asked to see “Club H,” the cellar space where Harry and friends would hang out. Though Harry told her the tabloid stories were untrue, she persisted in believing the place “smelled of weed.” Her willingness to believe the false reports saddened Harry.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key details and events described in the passage? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 

• Aunt Margo, Prince Harry's great-aunt, died in early 2002. Her death was hard on Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, Harry's great-grandmother, who was also ill. Despite this, The Queen Mother insisted on attending Margo's funeral. Soon after, The Queen Mother took a bad fall and was confined to bed. 

• Days later, Harry received a call informing him that The Queen Mother had died. Harry and William had to attend another funeral at Westminster Abbey and walk behind her gun carriage. Seeing The Queen Mother's crown on top of her coffin, with the famous Koh-i-Noor diamond, brought back memories of their mother's funeral.

• Months later, the royal family celebrated the Queen's Golden Jubilee, marking 50 years of her reign. Though the celebrations were extravagant, the Queen seemed unperturbed. Harry, however, was nervous due to a threat of blackmail—a newspaper editor claimed to have photos of Harry doing cocaine and demanded a meeting. Harry denied the claim and refused to meet the editor. Though Harry had used cocaine at the time, the threat of exposure during the Jubilee led him to realize it wasn't worth the risk. The editor's threat turned out to be a bluff.

• The Jubilee culminated in a church service and events where the Queen rode in a golden carriage. Despite the grandeur, Harry's favorite part was a concert the night before where stars like Paul McCartney and Brian May performed for the Queen, who seemed to genuinely enjoy the modern music. The Jubilee highlighted how much admiration and affection the public had for the Queen after 50 years as monarch.

 

- The narrator sits with his father, Prince Charles, to discuss his plans after finishing at Eton. The narrator considers various unconventional options like working at a ski resort or as a safari guide, but ultimately decides to join the army. His father agrees this is a good path.

- Before joining the army, the narrator decides to take a gap year to travel. He plans to spend six months working on a farm in Australia and six months doing AIDS outreach work in Lesotho, a small country in southern Africa. 

- The narrator meets up with his friend Henry van Straubenzee (“Henners”) in Edinburgh. Henners is also taking a gap year, working part-time at their old school, Ludgrove, and planning to join the army. They make plans to meet up again during their travels.

- Tragically, just two months later, Henners is killed in a car accident after leaving a party. The narrator and his brother attend the funeral, where they hear details about the foggy, late-night crash that led to Henners’ death at only 20 miles per hour. The narrator notes that the accident reminds him of their mother’s death.

- Before the narrator can begin his gap year, Eton requires him to participate in the school play, Much Ado About Nothing, in order to graduate. He is given only a minor role, leading the press to poke fun at him.

 Here is a summary of the passage:

- The narrator completes his education at Eton in June 2003 after years of hard work and tutoring arranged by his father, Prince Charles. However, soon after he is falsely accused of cheating on an art project. Though he is later cleared, the damage is done and he is labeled “Prince Thicko” by the media. 

- Upset by this, the narrator talks to his father who tells him not to read negative press coverage. Though the royal family claims not to read such press, the narrator knows they do. 

- To escape, the narrator’s friend Marko helps him find a summer job as a “jackaroo” or ranch hand in Australia at Tooloombilla farm owned by Noel and Annie Hill. The Hills were friends of the narrator’s late mother, Princess Diana. The narrator stays with the Hills and works with their son George.

- The Australian outback is an unfamiliar and harsh environment for the narrator who is used to a cool, temperate climate. However, he finds escape from his worries through the hard physical labor on the farm. The work demands stamina, skill with animals, and strong horseback riding abilities, all of which the narrator develops. 

- A typical day begins before dawn with various chores. The narrator and George then round up cattle that have wandered off, moving them to different locations as needed. Keeping the cattle together is challenging but important work. At times, the narrator and George have to chase after stray cattle, risking injury. The goal is to not let these chases last too long so as not to reduce the cattle’s value. Resources like food, water and grass are scarce.

- Overall, the passage depicts the narrator learning independence and valuable skills during his difficult time in Australia that contrast with his sheltered upbringing. The demanding ranch work provides an escape where he can avoid the troubles from home.

 

- The narrator, Prince Harry, spent nine weeks working on a cattle station in Australia owned by a family called the Hills. He loved the hard work and simplicity of the life. He bonded with the son, George, and earned the nickname “Spike.”

- Harry had to leave abruptly when paparazzi started sneaking onto the farm. He didn’t want the paparazzi to disrupt the Hill family’s privacy.

- Upon returning home, Harry went out to clubs, thinking the paparazzi didn’t know he was back yet. However, they spotted him leaving a club one night with a young woman. The next day, paparazzi nearly caused a car accident trying to get photos of him. The media focused on the fact that the woman was a “page-three girl” who posed topless, rather than on the reckless driving of the paparazzi. 

- Harry felt relieved to get away from England again. He decided to go to Lesotho for a gap year and invited his friend George, the son of the Australian cattle farmers, to join him.

The key details are:

1) Harry bonded with an Australian family while working on their cattle farm for 9 weeks. He earned the nickname Spike. 

2) He had to abruptly leave when paparazzi started intruding on the farm. 

3) Upon returning home, reckless paparazzi nearly caused a car accident trying to photograph him with a woman they deemed inappropriate due to her occupation. 

4) Harry felt a desire to escape England again. He invited his Australian friend George to join him for a gap year in Lesotho.

The summary gives the essential details of Harry’s time in Australia, his troublesome return home, and decision to embark on another escape, this time to Lesotho with his new friend George.

She agrees to come over with her girlfriend and brother. The narrator finds Chelsy refreshingly uninterested in his royal status. They bond over a shared love of Africa. The narrator invites Chelsy and her girlfriend to join him, George, and others on a trip to Botswana.

- In Botswana, the group goes on a three-day walking safari, mingling with wildlife. The narrator and Chelsy share their first kiss. George falls for Chelsy’s girlfriend.

- Around this time, the narrator, Prince Harry, goes on a training exercise with the British Special Boat Service with his brother Prince William.

The Palace announces the injury was from playing rugby, though Harry enjoys the lie.

- Harry attends a fancy dress party with a "natives and colonials" theme with William and William's new girlfriend Kate.

Though treated as a joke at the party, photos emerge and cause a media firestorm, with Harry vilified and ashamed of his foolish choice.

- Harry speaks with his father, Prince Charles, who is sympathetic and compassionate. Charles acknowledges it was the foolishness of youth and that everyone makes mistakes and bad choices when young and still growing up. Harry is grateful for his father's tenderness and understanding.

The summary outlines the progressively more intense phases of military training the narrator goes through over weeks and months, and his complex feelings of embracing the hardship and seeing it as a privilege, while also coming to realize the dangers and life-threatening risks.

 

- Prince Harry was deployed to southern Iraq in early 2007 as an armored reconnaissance troop leader.

- The public and media reaction was mixed. Some criticized sending a royal into a war zone, while others said he should serve like any other soldier. 

- Iraqi insurgents issued threats against Harry, saying they would kidnap, torture or kill him. One said Harry would return without his ears. Another said Harry's "blood will flow into our desert."

- Harry's girlfriend Chelsy was largely unaware of these threats because she avoided media coverage. 

- Two months after announcing the deployment, the head of the British Army canceled it due to the threats and Harry becoming too high of a target. He blamed the media for intensifying the threats with their coverage.

- Harry was disappointed his deployment was canceled and felt he was ready to serve. But he understood the decision was made for his safety and the safety of those around him.

- The threats and cancellation made Harry question whether his royal role would always prevent him from active military service. But he was determined to find a way to fulfill his duty as a soldier.

 

- Prince Harry was disappointed when he was pulled from his military deployment in Afghanistan. He felt guilty leaving his team and worried how they would fare without him. 

- Harry considered quitting the military altogether. He spoke with his girlfriend Chelsy and brother William about it, but they had mixed feelings. Harry turned to drinking to cope with the stress and disappointment.

- To honor the 10th anniversary of Princess Diana’s death, Harry and William organized a concert at Wembley Stadium. Though businesslike while planning, they became emotional during the event. Elton John performed “Your Song” in Diana’s memory. Harry and William appeared onstage but were too overcome to speak, showing how raw their grief still was.

- Harry went to Botswana with Chelsy to visit his former nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke, her husband, and his friend from Eton Adam Bidwell. Calling Tiggy “Mom” felt right to Harry, though he was careful to call her Mom rather than Mum, reserving that for his late mother. Though the visit was happy, Harry continued to struggle with stress and drank heavily.

 Here’s a summary:

The narrator is Prince Harry. He returns from a difficult tour in Africa struggling with guilt, anger issues and alcoholism. He asks his commanding officer, Colonel Ed, to allow him to return to combat operations. Colonel Ed suggests becoming a forward air controller (FAC) in Afghanistan as a safer option. 

Harry goes through intensive training to become an FAC at RAF Leeming in the Yorkshire Dales. The training involves coordinating mock air strikes over the beautiful landscape. Harry enjoys the poetic nature of the work and learning to guide others to see the world through his eyes.

To become combat-ready, Harry has to master 28 combat “controls” - scenarios coordinating with aircraft. Due to publicity concerns, he does the training in secret at Sandringham, his grandmother’s estate. He stays at a nearby hotel, Knights Hill, reveling in the privacy and focus of his work. However, he struggles to connect with his girlfriend Chelsy, who feels unseen in his single-minded pursuit of this goal.

Though focused, Harry knows his father Prince Charles is nearby at Sandringham and may check in on his progress. Harry looks forward to eventually deploying to Afghanistan, hoping the time will come soon.

 

- The narrator receives an invitation to attend the semifinal of the 2007 Rugby World Cup in Paris.

Going through the tunnel brings him a sense of closure but also renewed pain. 

- After a night of drinking, the narrator wanders off from his bodyguards. He walks around Paris in the early morning, seeing landmarks like the Seine river and the Champs-Élysées. Though a few people recognize him, he is left alone.

- The narrator talks with his brother Willy, who has also driven through the tunnel. They criticize the official inquest into their mother’s death as absurd and insufficient. They want to call for the inquiry to be reopened but are talked out of it.

- A month later, the narrator secretly boards a military transport plane to an undisclosed location. He hides in a bunk behind the cockpit, bringing only a small backpack and his packed duffel bag. Though he usually always has armed bodyguards, this time he is venturing out into the world alone. The long flight gives him time to reflect on leaving behind only a few possessions, including mementos of his mother, and his surrendered weapons.

The key events are:

1) The narrator finds closure but more pain by driving through the tunnel where his mother died. 

2) He wanders Paris alone, escaping his bodyguards for the first time. 

3) He and his brother bond over their frustration with the official explanation of their mother’s death.

4) The narrator boards a military plane to go to an unknown place, leaving his usual retinue behind.

Does this summary cover the key details accurately? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand the summary.

 

- The narrator is traveling on a military aircraft to Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan. During the long flight, he thinks about dying, creates his will, and worries about how he will be remembered. 

- He arrives at the airfield and is taken to a small military outpost called Forward Operating Base Dwyer. The outpost is very basic, with little infrastructure or amenities. Everything is covered in sand. The soldiers there have been stationed at Dwyer for a while and look unkempt. 

- At the center of the outpost is a makeshift monument with arrows pointing in the direction of the soldiers’ hometowns. The narrator decides not to put up an arrow indicating the direction of his home, Clarence House, in order to blend in. 

- The narrator meets Corporal of Horse Baxter, who shows him around the operations room. The narrator jokes around with Baxter, who seems unsure of how to respond to the narrator’s joking. Baxter shows the narrator the radios and surveillance equipment he will be using in his role.

- The surveillance equipment, referred to as “Kill TV,” involves long hours of tediously monitoring various empty locations in the region for any signs of enemy activity. The radios, or “Kill Radio,” provide a constant stream of chatter from various military groups. The narrator begins to learn the different call signs of the groups. His own call sign is Widow Six Seven.

- Baxter tells the narrator that while most of the time nothing happens, he has to remain alert for when something does occur. The narrator asks Baxter how he has avoided going mad from the dullness of the job. Baxter says that the trick is staying alert for when something actually happens.

 

- The narrator works as a Forward Air Controller (FAC) in Afghanistan, communicating with pilots and directing them where to drop bombs. He feels exhilarated by the important work he's doing, but also finds it terrifying due to the potential consequences of making a mistake. 

- His role allows him to hide behind the anonymity of his call sign, Widow Six Seven, which makes him feel normal for the first time. During downtime, he and the other soldiers work out, read, sleep, and eat to combat boredom. They get 30 minutes a week to call home on a satellite phone.

- The narrator worries he's missing out on the "real war" further down the valley. He requests and is granted a transfer to Forward Operating Base Delhi in Garmsir, an abandoned school now occupied by British and Gurkha soldiers. The Gurkhas revere royalty and insist on escorting the narrator everywhere, calling him "saab." They frequently make goat curry for the soldiers. 

- A helicopter delivers a goat as a Christmas present for the Gurkhas. The narrator recognizes the officer who delivers it, a man named Bevan who once worked for his father. Bevan seems attached to the goat, but the Gurkhas promptly kill and butcher it. They offer the narrator the chance to kill the second goat, but he declines, feeling there is enough killing already.

- The summary outlines the narrator's role as a FAC in Afghanistan, his transfer to a forward operating base, his recognition of the hierarchy and rituals of military life there, and his discomfort with some of the violence, even as he finds purpose in his work. The Gurkhas' reverence for him suggests his royal status, though he tries to downplay it.

 

- The narrator was promoted to a small lookout post above the battlefield. Shortly after arriving, the Taliban attacked the lookout. The narrator manned a 50-caliber machine gun and fired at the attackers, lighting up abandoned farmland, trees, and an old building. The British forces lobbed artillery at the attackers as well. The battle was chaotic and the narrator doesn’t remember much, but press footage shows him firing the machine gun. The British forces couldn’t confirm how many Taliban were killed.  

- The narrator was then summoned to Forward Operating Base Edinburgh, about 40 minutes away by helicopter. At FOB Edinburgh, the narrator was given quarters in a sandbag house and had an Estonian signals officer as a roommate. The nearby town of Musa Qala had just been recaptured from the Taliban after heavy fighting. Locals who had cooperated with British forces had been tortured and killed. Winning over the locals would be difficult.

- The narrator went on a patrol from FOB Edinburgh through Musa Qala. On the patrol, they came upon an improvised explosive device in a wadi. The narrator called in bomb disposal experts, who took a long time to deal with the IED, leaving the patrol exposed. They could hear Taliban scouts on motorbikes nearby and fired flares to warn them off.

The key events are:

1) The narrator mans a machine gun during a Taliban attack on his lookout post. 

2) The narrator is reassigned to FOB Edinburgh, where the nearby town of Musa Qala was just recaptured from the Taliban.

3) On a patrol, the narrator’s group comes upon an IED, which bomb disposal experts slowly deal with while the group is exposed to possible Taliban attack.

 

- The narrator is on patrol with his squadron in Afghanistan near the town of Musa Qala.

- The next day, the narrator goes on patrol but is paranoid that his cover has been blown. That night, Special Forces extract him by helicopter and take him to a forward operating base.

- There, the narrator’s commanding officer, Colonel Ed, informs him that his cover has indeed been blown. An Australian magazine published an article revealing that Prince Harry was serving in Afghanistan, and the news spread from there. For the safety of the narrator and others, he is being pulled out of Afghanistan immediately.

- Within an hour, the narrator is transported back to Kandahar airfield. His tour of duty has come to an abrupt end in order to ensure his safety and the safety of those around him now that his presence is known.

The key events are:

1) The narrator overhears radio chatter indicating his cover has been blown and he is in danger.

2) Special Forces extract the narrator from the battlefield. 

3) The narrator's commanding officer confirms his cover has been blown due to a news report revealing his presence.

4) For safety reasons, the narrator is pulled out of Afghanistan, ending his tour of duty.

 

- The narrator, presumably Prince Harry, is on a plane returning from Afghanistan. On the plane are three seriously injured British soldiers. This makes the narrator reflect on the reality of war and how little the public understands about it. 

- Upon landing, the narrator is greeted by his father and brother. Their interaction is awkward and restrained, showing how distant they have become. The narrator seems haunted by his experiences in Afghanistan.

- The narrator spends time with old friends but feels out of place. He reaches out to his ex-girlfriend Chelsy and they go on a trip to Botswana, where he opens up to a friend named Teej about his struggles. He cares for Chelsy but worries she can't handle the scrutiny of royal life. 

- The press harassment of Chelsy and the narrator's friends and family becomes unbearable. Chelsy tells the narrator she can't handle this life. Though it's painful, he understands.

- The narrator meets a woman named Caroline Flack and they begin dating. But soon the press discovers them and subjects Flack and her loved ones to harassment as well. Though they try to persist, the relationship is ruined by the media scrutiny. 

- The narrator seems to lead a lonely, claustrophobic existence, unable to live freely or maintain meaningful relationships due to the press and public obsession with his life. There is a deep sense of anger and frustration with this situation throughout the summary.

 

- The author went with a friend, JLP, to Kensington Palace to have cocktails with General Dannatt. The author felt anxious but the general and his wife greeted them warmly. The general expressed regret that the author’s deployment was cut short. The general suggested the author become a helicopter pilot so he could return to Afghanistan in a safer role.

- The author spent the summer of 2008 focused on wounded soldiers from Afghanistan. He went on an official trip to America where he visited wounded soldiers and 9/11 victims’ families. He began working with the charity Help for Heroes. He spent time visiting soldiers at military hospitals in Britain, listening to them and offering support. 

- The author went to Botswana to help friends, Teej and Mike, film a documentary about elephant poaching. The author worked as an unpaid cameraman and enjoyed the work. While filming, they had to chase an elephant through the bush after a tranquilizer dart didn’t fully sedate it. The author ran 8 kilometers without shoes to keep up.

- In early 2009, a video surfaced of the author from 3 years earlier, when he was a cadet. In the video, the author referred to a Pakistani friend as “our little Paki friend.” The author didn’t realize this was a slur and meant no harm, though he acknowledges his privilege and isolation at the time.

The summary touches on the key details, events, and takeaways from the passages in a concise yet cohesive way. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 

- A controversial video of Prince Harry using racist language surfaced and caused public outrage. 

- Prince Harry felt terrible and apologized to the person targeted in the video. However, the controversy continued to spread.

- To escape the furor, Prince Harry began flight training with the Royal Air Force. He started with basic training to ensure he was fit. Then he began training to fly a Firefly, a single-propeller plane.

- His instructor, Sergeant Major Booley, repeatedly threw the plane into stalls during flight to teach Prince Harry how to recover control. After many practice flights, Booley had Prince Harry fly solo for the first time.

- Prince Harry then moved on to helicopter flight training. Helicopters were much more complex, and hovering was especially difficult due to "hover monkeys" - the wobbles and instabilities that occur when a helicopter hovers just above the ground. After many attempts, Prince Harry was able to land during his first solo flight.

- During this training, Prince Harry lived in a cottage with his brother, Prince William, who was also in flight training. They enjoyed living together for the first time since attending Eton College.

 

- After an investigation, reporters and editors at Rupert Murdoch’s News of the World were arrested for hacking phones and harassing public figures. Two journalists who had targeted the narrator in the past, “the Thumb” and “Rehabber Kooks,” were among those facing legal consequences. 

- The narrator and his friend Willy felt vindicated in their long-held suspicions about the tabloid press. However, they didn’t discuss the unfolding events much, perhaps because the issues were still too painful or unresolved. There may have also been some underlying tension between the two of them.

- The narrator continued his flight training, learning combat flight techniques from an instructor named Nigel, or “Nige.” Nige pushed the narrator hard, criticizing his mistakes and lack of self-confidence. The narrator sometimes lashed out in response but came to appreciate Nige’s truthful and direct approach. Under Nige’s guidance, the narrator learned the skills and self-belief to become an accomplished pilot.

- After completing the final stages of helicopter flight training, the narrator expected to start flying Apache helicopters. However, he was first made to take a three-month course reading about Apaches, nearly driving him insane. He considered quitting the course out of frustration.

The key events are the downfall of the tabloid figures who had targeted the narrator, the narrator’s intensive flight training with Nige, and his disappointment at facing more classroom work before flying real Apaches. Overall, it depicts the narrator’s gradual progress toward his goal of becoming an Apache pilot.

 

- The narrator is turning 25, which feels like a watershed moment. He decides to mark the occasion with a trip to Botswana to visit friends. 

- His friends tell him he seems more grounded and mature. The narrator reflects that this is odd, given that he has spent so much time recently learning to fly.

- Mike, a friend, tells the narrator that it’s time for him to give back to Africa, rather than just taking from it, as many Brits have done. Mike suggests the narrator use his platform to shine a light on important issues facing Africa like climate change, poaching, drought, and fires.

- On a boat trip, the narrator and his friends get caught in a big storm at night. They have trouble navigating the river in the dark and their boat driver is drunk. The narrator takes the wheel.

- In a flash of lightning, they spot a group of elephants standing in the river. The narrator locks eyes with one of the elephants and feels a connection. The elephant’s eye reminds him of the Apache’s monocle, the Koh-i-Noor diamond, and a camera lens, but unlike those objects, the elephant’s eye makes him feel safe rather than judged.

- The overall message seems to be that this trip to Africa and encounter with the elephants is a pivotal, meaningful moment for the narrator as he comes of age at 25. The elephant's eye, in particular, is a powerful symbol of wisdom and connection.

 

- In May 2010, the narrator receives his wings in the Army Air Corps from his father. Shortly after, he and Chelsy break up again, realizing the relationship won’t work with his military deployment. 

- Before deploying to Afghanistan, the narrator visits schools in Lesotho, a country with a high HIV rate, with Prince William. They meet shepherd boys who walk hours to get an education despite facing many dangers and hardships. The narrator is inspired by their resilience and joy.

- In November 2010, the Palace announces Prince William’s engagement to Kate Middleton. The narrator never gave William their mother’s sapphire ring. William had already received it after her death.

- The narrator reflects on being single and wonders if he’ll ever become a young father like he wanted. He finds purpose in his military service and charitable work. He’s invited to join wounded soldiers on a trek to the North Pole to raise money, though it’s close to William’s wedding. 

- The narrator’s mentor advises him to go on the trek, calling it a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” First, the mentor arranges for the narrator to visit Berlin, where he sees remnants of the Nazi regime and meets a Holocaust survivor. The trip reinforces why he’s fighting in Afghanistan.

- The narrator decides to join the North Pole trek, hoping to make it back for William’s wedding. The trek would be difficult and dangerous, but meaningful. His purpose comes from helping others.

The summary covers the key events, reflections, and themes around the narrator finding purpose and meaning in 2010 through military and charitable service. Despite relationship troubles and uncertainty, he pursues opportunities to make a difference in the lives of others.

- The narrator did not feel comfortable or look smart in his own uniform. He had just returned from the trek and was still recovering from frostnip.

The key details are: the narrator's trek to the North Pole where he got frostnip; Prince William's pre-wedding nerves and desire to see the crowds; memories of Princess Diana's death being brought up; William's unhappiness with having to wear a uniform not of his choice; and the narrator's own discomfort after just returning from the harsh trek.

 

- The narrator, presumably Prince Harry, wore his military uniform for his brother Prince William’s wedding. He felt silly in the elaborate uniform but had to wear it due to protocol. 

- Before the wedding, Harry met with William. William smelled of alcohol from the night before. Harry jokingly offered him mints. They rode in a car to Westminster Abbey, where their mother Princess Diana’s funeral had been held. This brought up sad memories for both of them.

- At the wedding, Harry had the responsibility of holding onto the wedding ring. He took this job seriously. The wedding ceremony itself is a blur in his memory. Afterward, he realized that with his marriage, William was moving on to a new phase of life and adulthood. Harry felt he was losing his brother in a way. He saw weddings as marking the end of an era. 

- At the reception, Harry made a short speech. He poked fun at William and shared amusing messages of support from well-wishers. He ended by speaking about how their late mother would have loved to be there and loved Kate. Harry avoided making eye contact with his father or stepmother while speaking. 

- Later, Harry got a call from the team that had walked to the North Pole to raise money for wounded veterans. Although Harry congratulated them, he was actually still dealing with physical discomfort from frostbite on his genitals. He tried using his mother’s Elizabeth Arden cream, which brought up memories of her. Ultimately, he had to discreetly find a doctor to treat his condition.

The key events are William and Kate’s wedding, Harry’s conflicting emotions around it, his short reception speech, his lingering frostbite discomfort, and seeking medical treatment undercover. The theme of loss, change, and Harry’s close relationship with his late mother emerge throughout the summary.

- The narrator was heartbroken and had trouble sleeping. He went on military training exercises to distract himself, going to the US and then Cornwall, England.

- In Cornwall, the narrator participated in a difficult training exercise called Escape and Evasion. He and two other men had to traverse ten miles of rough terrain, imagining they had crash landed behind enemy lines.

- The conditions were very harsh, with heavy rain and cold. They had few supplies and were not allowed to ask locals for help. The narrator came to deeply appreciate one of the men in his group for his knowledge and skills.

- Overall, the narrator was struggling after his breakup with Flea and the training exercise in Cornwall only added to his difficulties. But he was gaining valuable experience that would help prepare him for deployment.

The narrator's friend Billy looked into them and found that Tweedle Dumb is aggressive while Tweedle Dumber mostly just stares. They are trying to become famous by ruining the narrator's life. 
- The narrator realizes the paparazzi don't understand that fame isn't all it's cracked up to be. They are being paid well by media barons like Rupert Murdoch to stalk the royal family. The narrator had an unsettling encounter with Tweedle Dumb at a secluded wedding. 
- The constant harassment by the paparazzi has made the narrator ready to go to war and want to leave England. He then meets a woman named Cressida and starts dating her, though he has to leave soon for deployment. His friends remind him of a plan they had made to seize the day and go to Vegas. Though risky, the narrator realizes life is short after witnessing a polo player almost die. He saved the man's life.

In summary, the passage describes the narrator's frustration with aggressive paparazzi harassing him, his budding relationship with a woman named Cressida, and his realization that he should seize opportunities in life before it's too late.

Well, now, Harold, I’m not sure about that. I wouldn’t say THAT!

 

Say to Granny, and the time had come. 

After a day of shooting, you finally got Granny alone. You told her you wanted to marry Meg, and asked for her permission, as was required. Though her initial response was ambiguous, you eventually realized she was granting you permission. You were overjoyed at receiving her blessing.

- As the wedding approached, the press focused on reporting details about the flowers, music, food, etc. Harry banned the royal correspondents, known as the Royal Rota, from the wedding chapel itself.

- They left the hospital quickly and announced the birth from Frogmore. The media felt tricked and responded angrily. A BBC presenter compared the new royal baby to a chimpanzee.

- The author and his wife Meghan announced they were suing three British tabloids for their abusive and dishonest coverage of Meghan. They announced this right before privacy laws in Britain were going to change in the tabloids’ favor.

- The author told his grandmother the Queen and his father Prince Charles about the lawsuit in advance. But when the author showed up for a lunch at Buckingham Palace, his father and officials from the royal households ambushed him about the lawsuit, saying it damaged the reputation of the royal family. 

- The author argued that the family had not done enough to protect him and Meghan from abusive press coverage. He cited many examples of racist and sexist articles and social media posts about Meghan. A study found the hate directed at Meghan was unusually extreme. The author said this hate had real effects and the situation was wholly unique.

- The author said he and Meghan had begged the royal family and households for more resources and support in dealing with the press, but officials falsely claimed they had received no such requests.

- The author and Meghan attended an annual charity event honoring ill children. The author had been involved with the charity for years. The event was emotional given the children’s conditions and bravery.

 

- Meg and the narrator had a baby boy named Archie about a year ago. Recently, the narrator choked up while speaking at an event for sick children and their parents. His brother, Willy, texted to say he was worried, but an argument ensued after Willy accused the narrator of being “unwell” and needing help. 

- Meg and the narrator decided to escape the drama surrounding them by borrowing a friend’s house on Vancouver Island. For six weeks, they lived quietly and peacefully. But then their location was published by a tabloid and paparazzi swarmed them. They realized they wanted more freedom from the British press.

- The narrator suggested to his grandmother, the Queen, that they spend half the year in Cape Town to get away from the drama. Previously, a similar suggestion was leaked to the press. This time, the narrator sent a confidential letter to his father, Prince Charles, with the idea. Charles refused to speak to him on the phone and said they’d have to meet in person at the end of January.

- The narrator then called the Queen to arrange a meeting to discuss the plan in early January. She agreed but then her staff said the meeting was not possible. The narrator concluded his father had blocked him from seeing his grandmother. When Meg and the narrator flew back to Britain, the narrator considered driving to Sandringham to see the Queen anyway but realized he’d have to wait. He called the Queen again but the call went unanswered.

In summary, the narrator and Meg want freedom from the drama surrounding them in Britain but have faced obstacles and secrecy in trying to arrange meetings to discuss their hopes for a different working arrangement. The narrator’s father and grandmother’s staff seem intent on blocking open communication.

 Here is a summary of the events:

- Harry receives word that The Sun newspaper is about to publish a story saying that he and Meghan are stepping away from their royal duties. He calls his grandmother, the Queen, to warn her and says they may need to release a statement in response.

- Harry and Meghan work on drafting a statement to get ahead of the news report. They want the wording to be careful and measured. They struggle to finish it in time and The Sun publishes their story first.

- A few days later, there is a meeting at Sandringham estate to discuss the situation. Harry attends but Meghan has returned to Canada with their son Archie. The Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William, and staff are also present. 

- Harry complains about the cruel press coverage they have received and says the royal family has enabled this by courting the media. Prince William complains about a news story suggesting he bullied Harry and Meghan out of the family.

- The staff present five options for how to proceed, ranging from continuing as usual to Harry and Meghan leaving their royal roles entirely. Harry says he mainly wants to retain security for his family. He thinks the compromise Option 3, where they live elsewhere part-time but continue some work, is best.

- However, the royal family will only accept either continuing as usual (Option 1) or Harry and Meghan leaving their roles completely (Option 5). The staff have already drafted a statement announcing the implementation of Option 5 before the meeting even began.

- Harry is confused why a statement has already been drafted without discussion. The implication is that the royal family had already decided on Option 5 before hearing what Harry had to say.

 In summary, it appears the summit was largely for show and that there were likely no real options or draft statements considered. The author was given the runaround, wore down, and essentially forced to accept whatever option was presented, as long as security provisions remained in place. It seems the author was intentionally misled and that the agreement announced was not actually agreed upon or drafted with the author's input or approval. The author expresses feelings of being blindsided, stunned and upset upon finding out a statement denying bullying claims had been issued in their name without consent. Overall, it appears the summit was a sham and the author felt manipulated.

 

The narrator and his wife Meg faced serious security threats and lacked protection from the royal family. A friend, Tyler Perry, offered them a safe house in Los Angeles to stay in. They accepted and moved in during March 2020. Their son Archie took his first steps there. They launched a foundation and the narrator reconnected with conservation contacts. However, the media found them and they had to leave after six weeks.

The narrator's father cut him off financially, leaving them struggling to pay for security and a new home. Meg became pregnant again during this time. They found a new home in Santa Barbara and moved in July 2020, though the move was stressful for Meg due to issues with her legal case against tabloid newspapers.

 

- Meg had a miscarriage due to the stress from the tabloid lawsuit. They lost their unborn child.

- On Christmas, they bought a Christmas tree and exchanged gifts. Meg gave Harry an ornament of the Queen which Archie accidently broke. Harry found it amusing that his mother seemed to find it funny.

- The Palace stripped them of their royal roles and patronages, saying they would no longer do any service for the Queen. Harry and Meg pushed back saying they would never stop serving. The Palace's actions led to more media attacks on them.

- Harry asked the Palace to lay a wreath for Remembrance Day but they denied his request. He ended up having a former military instructor lay one for him instead. 

- Harry met with a woman who claimed to have "powers". She told him that his mother Diana was with him and proud of the life he was living. As proof, she referenced the broken ornament of the Queen that Archie tried to fix.

- After Prince Philip's funeral, Harry went for a walk with William and Charles. They asked about his hacking lawsuit but still didn't ask about Meg. Charles said journalists were scum but also loved their praise. He told Harry to endure it and the press would eventually respect him. Harry said it would take longer to forgive his family's role in enabling the press. Charles had called Meg a bully in the latest media campaign.

 

- The narrator and his wife, Meg, have another baby, a daughter this time. The birth goes smoothly and without complications. The narrator is fully present for the birth and helps pull the baby out. When she is born, he is struck by the intensity of the present moment. He has a hard time seeing at first because he is so overwhelmed. He wants to ask the baby profound questions about where she came from. 

- Meg says that she has never loved the narrator more than in the moment he helped deliver their daughter. She writes about it in her journal, describing it as a love poem, testament, renewal of vows, citation, remembrance, proclamation, and decree. She says that the narrator is "everything" and "a man," not "a Spare."

- The epilogue implies that the narrator goes on to help Meg in a continuing way, suggesting they live happily together as a family of four. The birth of their daughter seems to be a transcendent moment that reaffirms their love and bond.

The key details are:

1) The narrator and Meg have a second child, a daughter, whose birth goes well. 

2) The narrator helps deliver the baby and is struck by the intensity and profundity of the moment. He is overwhelmed with emotion and questions for the new baby.

3) Meg writes about the experience in her journal, describing the narrator and the moment in deeply loving and appreciative terms. She says he is "everything" and a real man, not a "Spare."

4) The epilogue suggests they go on to live happily together as a family of four. The birth is a transcendent experience that strengthens their relationship.

 

- The narrator and his wife Meg travel to Althorp, his mother’s childhood home, to visit his mother’s grave on the 25th anniversary of her death. It is also Meg’s first time visiting. They pray for clarity and guidance at the grave.

- A few days later, the narrator gets a call that his grandmother’s health has declined. He rushes to Balmoral to see her but arrives too late. His grandmother, the Queen, has passed away. He sees her body and says goodbye, telling her he hopes she is with his grandfather. 

- The narrator and Meg have to extend their trip to attend funeral events. The narrator finds the events emotional, remembering his grandmother and all the occasions they shared. He wishes he had one more goodbye.

- Upon returning home, the narrator can’t stop thinking about his grandmother and misses their special relationship. A hummingbird gets into their house, which a friend says could be a spirit visitor. The narrator reads that hummingbirds are seen as spirits, visitors, and voyagers in some cultures. He sees the hummingbird in his house as possibly being a sign from his grandmother.
