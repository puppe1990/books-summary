 

- The author is Jordan Belfort, the founder of Stratton Oakmont and the inspiration for The Wolf of Wall Street. 

- Belfort considers himself a natural-born salesman and developed a sales training system called the Straight Line System that helped many people become successful in sales.

- The Straight Line System was very effective but also led to excess and lack of control. It eventually caused the downfall of Belfort and Stratton Oakmont.

- However, the Straight Line System has endured and spread, though in a more ethical form. Belfort has spent years revising and improving the system to remove questionable tactics. 

- The revised Straight Line System has been taught all over the world in many industries with great success. Belfort believes the system can empower anyone to achieve in sales.

- The book will detail the Straight Line System and how readers can apply it to their own selling.

 

- The author discovered that "every sale is the same" which led to the creation of the Straight Line System. This discovery hit him suddenly during an emergency sales training meeting. 
- At the time, the author ran a brokerage firm called Stratton that sold penny stocks. The firm was very successful, with brokers earning over $12K a month on average. One star broker, Danny Porush, earned over $72K in one commission.
- The author tested selling $5 stocks to the richest 1% of Americans and the results were incredible. So he decided to reinvent his firm to focus on this niche. 
- However, training his young and inexperienced brokers to sell to wealthy investors proved nearly impossible. After 4 weeks of calling wealthy prospects, they hadn't made any sales. The author started to doubt himself and his strategy. 
- But during an emergency meeting, the author had an epiphany that "every sale is the same." He realized the principles of salesmanship and persuasion were universal. The key was simplifying the sales process into a "straight line" that his brokers could follow.  
- The Straight Line System involves understanding people's core motivations and using a systematic set of steps to persuade them. By following this system, the author's brokers went on to have unparalleled success selling to wealthy investors.

The key takeaways are:
1) The discovery of the "straight line" system was a breakthrough that allowed average people to become highly successful in sales. 
2) At its core, the straight line system involves understanding human psychology and motivations, then systematically persuading people based on those insights.
3) Following a proven and ethical sales system is key to success, versus relying on innate talent alone. With the right system, average people can achieve exceptional results.

 

The author was responsible for training new stockbrokers. After failing with their own training system and other methods, the author realized the key to closing a sale is creating certainty in the prospect's mind. There are three areas of certainty, called the "Three Tens," that must align for a prospect to buy:

1. Certainty about the product. The prospect must believe the product is extremely valuable and meets their needs. This is rated on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being absolute certainty the product is great, and 1 being absolute certainty the product is worthless. 

2. Certainty about the company. The prospect must believe the company selling the product is reputable, stable, and able to support the product and customer. This is also rated on a scale of 1 to 10.

3. Certainty about the future. The prospect must believe acquiring the product will improve their future in a meaningful way. This is rated on the same 1 to 10 scale.

If all Three Tens are at a level of 5 or higher, the chance of closing the sale is good. Below 5, the chance is very low. The closer to 10 in all areas, the better the chance of closing. But a prospect's current rating in any area is not final and can be influenced by an effective sales presentation.

The key is creating certainty in the prospect's mind about all Three Tens. If done well, the prospect will believe the product is "the best thing since sliced bread," the company is completely reputable, and their future will be greatly improved, leading to a closed sale. But without alignment in all Three Tens, the chance of closing drops dramatically.

 

- The obvious answer to whether a prospect will buy when they’re at a 10 on the certainty scale is yes. However, the correct answer is actually maybe. 
- There are three factors that determine if a prospect will buy:

1. The product: How certain are they about the product or service?
2. You: How much do they trust and connect with you? 
3. The company: How much do they trust the company you work for?

- All three factors must be at a high level of certainty for a prospect to buy. If any one is low, the chances of closing the sale are low. 
- Prospects enter a sales encounter at some level of certainty for all three factors, based on their experiences and perceptions. As a salesperson, your job is to move them to higher levels of certainty.
- There are two types of certainty:

1. Logical certainty: Based on facts, evidence, and reasoning. Appeals to the rational mind. 
2. Emotional certainty: Based on feelings and intuition. Appeals to the emotional mind.

- Both types of certainty are needed for a prospect to buy. Logical certainty is based on facts while emotional certainty is based on creating a positive feeling. As a salesperson, you need to build certainty using both facts/evidence and by creating a positive emotional experience with the prospect.

The key takeaway is that certainty is absolutely essential for closing sales, and there are two types of certainty you must build with prospects: logical and emotional. You have to establish high levels of certainty for your product, yourself, and your company by giving prospects facts, evidence, and a positive feeling.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key points about certainty in sales? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 

- Jordan Belfort came up with the idea for the Straight Line System one Tuesday evening. 

- At 7 pm, he started a meeting with a group of his employees called the Strattonites to teach them his new sales system.

- The Strattonites worked as stockbrokers, cold-calling people from lists of leads purchased from Dun & Bradstreet. For every 200 leads, top brokers could get 10 good leads and open 2-3 new accounts, earning them over $2 million per year. However, the Strattonites were performing poorly.

- Belfort was determined to turn them into top producers using his new Straight Line System. The system focused on creating certainty in prospects over three areas: product, company, and salesperson. If a prospect lacks certainty in any area, they will make objections instead of buying. Objections are meant to avoid confrontation, not convey the real reasons for not buying.

- The Straight Line System aims to get honest communication from the prospect by making it the salesperson’s responsibility. It provides a “bulletproof formula” for achieving honest communication and overcoming objections. 

- Belfort emphasized that the Straight Line System does not involve high-pressure tactics. It relies on honesty and forthrightness. The system was meant to change the lives of millions by creating top sales producers.

- Belfort was ready to teach the Strattonites all night if needed to turn them into top producers. He locked eyes with each of them to convey the seriousness of his intent.

 

The brokers were complaining that closing wealthy clients was too difficult due to the large number of objections they were facing. They claimed there were "thousands" of objections preventing them from even beginning their sales pitches. 

To prove them wrong, the speaker asked them to list out all the objections. After listing out 14 common objections, the speaker realized that most of the objections were just variations of uncertainties prospects had or excuses to avoid making a decision. The key to overcoming objections was not just answering them but addressing the underlying uncertainty and need for certainty.

While staring at the whiteboard filled with objections, the speaker had an epiphany about the repetitive nature of sales. He realized that every sale followed the same straight line from beginning to end. Focusing on any part of that line revealed the experiences and strategies that made his system work. In a couple seconds, he gained a huge insight into the systematic process of sales. 

With this new understanding, the speaker's view of the brokers' abilities changed. He now saw their potential and was determined to teach them his sales strategies. The Straight Line System was born in that moment of insight.

In summary, an exercise to have the brokers list out objections unexpectedly led to a breakthrough in understanding the sales process and the development of the Straight Line System. The speaker realized that the key to sales was addressing uncertainty and that effective selling followed a repetitive process that could be mapped out.

 The key points in the passage are:

1. Every sale follows a straight line from the open to the close. The goal is to keep the prospect moving along this straight line towards agreeing to buy. 

2. There are two types of sales: perfect lay-down sales where the prospect says yes easily, and typical sales where the prospect tries to take control and move the conversation off the straight line. The salesperson must prevent this and keep guiding the prospect back to the straight line.

3. The straight line represents staying focused on the relevant topics to make the sale. Going above the line is getting distracted by irrelevant topics like politics. Going below the line is getting into unsuitable topics. The salesperson must keep the conversation within the boundaries of the straight line.

4. When on the straight line, the salesperson is talking and directing the conversation. When off the straight line but within the boundaries, the prospect is talking and the salesperson is listening. This builds rapport and gathers important information. 

5. The information gathered includes the prospect's needs, beliefs, past experiences, values, financial standards, sources of pain, and financial situation. This intelligence helps in overcoming objections and closing the sale.

6. Even when off the straight line, the goal is to continue progressing the sale forward along the straight line towards the close. The encounter must still be kept within the boundaries of relevance.

The key weaknesses or potential issues with this approach are:

1. Pushing a prospect through a "straight line" sale too forcefully could seem manipulative or make them feel railroaded into a decision before they are ready. Some prospects may respond better to a less directive approach.

2. Focusing so narrowly on a straight path to the close could result in missing important signals from the prospect or failing to address their key concerns fully. A more flexible, customized approach may be needed for some sales.

3. Relying too much on a formulaic sales script may make the salesperson seem insincere or like they do not care about the prospect's unique needs and priorities. Striking a balance between structure and personal connection is important.

4. Gathering sensitive financial and personal information in order to leverage a prospect's "pain" and push them to buy could be seen as unethical by some. This approach should be used judiciously and with care.

5. There are many effective sales approaches and strategies. Presenting this as the single right way to sell successfully could be seen as short-sighted or arrogant. Adaptability and openness to other methods may produce better results.

 

Towards the close of the passage, the key points are:

1) The front half of the sale involves taking control, gathering intelligence through specific questions, and building rapport. After asking for the order the first time, the back half begins where objections are addressed. 

2) The goal is to increase the prospect's level of certainty to get them to say yes. This is done through goal-oriented communication moving them down the straight line.

3) A continuum of certainty from 1 to 10 is used. Every word and action aims to increase the prospect's certainty.

4) The Straight Line System was created and taught to the Strattonites, leading to unprecedented success. Word spread and many new brokers joined.

5) Daily motivation and skills training were provided to enhance mindsets and skillsets. The past does not equal the future. Acting "as if" success was certain led to success.

6) While building them up, honesty about their potential averageness was used to emphasize the importance of skills training. They likely felt average at times due to societal messages.

7) They were told they were now different due to the Straight Line System. Their old limited beliefs and skillsets were gone. They now had an edge to separate themselves and succeed.

8) In summary, the close of the passage focuses on inspiring and motivating the Strattonites to believe in their newfound abilities and potential through the Straight Line System. Their old mindsets and skillsets were replaced, and success was now inevitable if they fully embraced the system.

 

The Straight Line System is an effective sales training methodology. It teaches salespeople a skill set that allows them to become extremely persuasive and close deals at a high rate. The system focuses on five core elements:

1. The Three Tens: The prospect must love your product (10/10), trust and connect with you (10/10), and trust and connect with your company (10/10). The goal is to increase the prospect's certainty in all three areas. 

2. Asking for the order: You ask the prospect for the order to see if you have a "lay-down" sale. If not, you move to the next element.

3. Looping: This is an objection-handling technique where you address objections by further increasing the prospect's certainty, without breaking rapport, and then transitioning back to asking for the order. You continue looping to bring the prospect closer to a 10/10/10 level of certainty.

4. Action threshold: This refers to the level of certainty a prospect needs to buy. Some prospects have a high threshold, some low. You can lower a prospect's action threshold, making them easier to sell to. 

5. Pain threshold: For very tough prospects, you need to determine their pain points and position your product as the solution to their pain. This creates urgency and motivation for them to buy.

In summary, the Straight Line System is a comprehensive sales methodology focused on increasing a prospect's certainty, lowering their action threshold, and leveraging their pain points - all to motivate them to say "yes" to the sale. By mastering these elements, students of the system can become extremely effective persuaders and closers.

 

- Humans are fear-based creatures who make snap judgments about new people and situations in just a few seconds.

- Over the phone, you have about 4 seconds to make a good first impression before someone makes a judgment about you. In person, it happens even faster in about 1/4 of a second.

- In those first few seconds, you need to establish that you are:

1. Sharp as a tack
2. Enthusiastic as hell 
3. An expert in your field

- If you fail to establish these attributes quickly, you'll have an uphill battle to overcome the prospect's initial negative impression. You only have about 10 more seconds to recover before the prospect has made a firm judgment.

- People judge books by their covers, even if we're taught otherwise. It's human nature to make snap judgments.

- People prefer to do business with experts, not novices. We've been conditioned from an early age to seek out experts to solve our problems.

- Examples: As children, we rely on doctors, teachers, coaches, tutors, etc. - experts in their fields. As adults, we continue seeking out experts to help us.

- The key is to establish yourself as an expert in the prospect's mind within the first few seconds of interacting with them. If you do, you have a shot at closing them. If not, you likely have no chance.

 

- ylist, a celebrity stylist, has been making celebrities look glamorous for the past twenty years. Celebrities, like any successful people, want to work with experts and pros who have a proven track record of success and expertise. 

- Similarly, professional golfers like Jordan Spieth or Jason Day would turn to a world-renowned golf swing coach, not a local amateur, if they need to improve their game. Experts inspire confidence through their experience and mastery. Novices, on the other hand, sound less self-assured and authoritative.

- First impressions matter tremendously in sales. According to studies, people form impressions within the first five seconds of an interaction, and negative first impressions are very hard to overcome. So salespeople must establish three qualities within the first few seconds:

1. Sharpness: Come across as mentally agile, quick-thinking, and able to solve problems. Sound like someone who can help the prospect achieve their goals.

2. Enthusiasm: Sound excited, energetic, and passionate. This conveys the message that you have something great to offer.

3. Expertise: Establish yourself as extremely knowledgeable and an authority in your field. This gains the prospect's respect and trust. Translate technical details into simple benefits for the prospect. 

- Establishing these qualities makes the prospect see you as someone worth listening to—someone who can get to the point quickly, not waste time, solve their problems, and provide value for the long run. The prospect will infer that you can help them satisfy their needs and desires.

- However, also be an expert listener, not just an expert talker. Ask questions and let the prospect speak. Don't dominate the conversation.

- To convey the right qualities on the phone when prospects can't see you, focus on your tone of voice and vocal qualities like pacing, pauses, and inflection. Your words alone won't sufficiently establish the right perception. The way you say things has a huge impact. Match your tone to the qualities you want to convey. For example, speak energetically and enthusiastically to convey passion.

 

- The first 4 seconds of communication and the tone you set throughout a conversation have a huge impact. After millions of years of evolution, humans have become adept at recognizing subtle tonal shifts that can dramatically change meaning.

- Tone of voice and body language make up 90% of communication. Words alone are only 10%. Even though words are critical when speaking, most of the time we are communicating without words through tone and body language. 

- There are 29 tones humans use but only 10 are core to influencing and persuading. Likewise, there are infinite body language gestures but only 10 core principles. These are easy to learn and master.

- With a little training, you can get good results even at a low level of competency due to the “Good Enough Factor.” Most see at least a 50% increase in sales, especially as novices in short sales cycles.

- You already intuitively know the 10 tones and 10 body language principles. You’ve used them countless times in your life, just not consciously or with intent. The key is to use them deliberately and modulate them for impact.

- Examples of using tone strategically:

› Power whisper from your gut to convey importance. Lower your voice, then raise it.

› Modulate speed, pace, declarative statements, questions, word groupings, etc.

› Bottled enthusiasm just below the surface, enunciating clearly and stressing consonants to convey intensity and certainty. But not over the top.

- In summary, subtle shifts in tone and body language are extremely powerful in communication and persuasion. Mastering just 10 core tones and body language principles can dramatically improve your influence and results.

 

- Speak with enthusiasm and confidence to sound like an expert in control.  Vary your tonality and body language to keep the prospect engaged.

- A prospect will listen if they believe you can help them achieve their goals and resolve their problems.  If not, they will tune out.  

- The unconscious mind is far more powerful than the conscious mind.  It controls bodily functions, stores memories, and creates patterns of behavior and snap judgments about the world.  The conscious mind focuses on a few items and uses logic and reason.

- The unconscious mind creates a "map of the world" to help navigate and make quick decisions.  It matches new experiences to what it knows and creates patterns of behavior to respond fluidly without much thought. 

- Though first impressions come from the unconscious mind, words can quickly change them.  Emotional cases rely more on unconscious communication like tonality and body language.  Logical cases rely more on words.

- In sales, use words to influence the conscious mind and tonality/body language for the unconscious mind.  The outcomes are airtight logical and emotional cases.  Know what to say and how to communicate unconsciously.

- Success requires managing your emotional state before and during the sales encounter.  The next chapter discusses state management.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

•State management refers to controlling your emotional state to achieve a desired outcome. It involves temporarily blocking negative thoughts and emotions to maintain a positive state of mind. 

•Your current emotional state determines whether you can access your internal resources to achieve your goals. Empowered states give you access while disempowered states block access.

•Empowered states like certainty, clarity, confidence, and courage are key to success in sales and life. You need to learn how to trigger them at will.

•You don't want to be in an empowered state all the time. Use state management strategically before key moments like sales encounters, business deals, negotiations, and important life decisions.

•Olfactory anchoring is a technique to instantly trigger an empowered state. It involves using your sense of smell to anchor the resourceful state you want to a particular scent. Then reactivating that state whenever needed by re-exposing yourself to that scent.

•Olfactory anchoring was created to help trigger empowered states even in difficult circumstances, like demanding travel and work schedules. It allows you to perform at your best whenever needed.

•The key is to pick a scent that you personally find empowering and anchor the resourceful state to that scent through visualization and repetition. Then re-expose yourself to that scent whenever you want to activate that state.

•With practice, olfactory anchoring can become an unconscious process. The empowered state is triggered automatically upon encountering the anchored scent. This gives you an effective tool for instant state management.

 

- The author had to instantly change his emotional state from zero to 100 mph to prepare for going on stage. 

- He used a technique called NLP anchoring, which is based on the idea that the human brain can be programmed like a computer by using language patterns. 

- According to NLP, a person's emotional state depends on two things:

1. What they choose to focus on. Focusing on positive things leads to a positive state, while focusing on negative things leads to a negative state.

2. Their physiology - posture, facial expression, breathing, etc. There are predictable physiological patterns for different emotional states that are consistent across cultures.

- Although a person can temporarily change their emotional state, it's hard to maintain an acted state for a long time. NLP anchoring aims to make state changes last longer.

- NLP anchoring is based on Pavlov's experiments showing that pairing an unconditioned stimulus (like food) with a conditioned stimulus (like a bell ringing) can lead to the conditioned stimulus alone eliciting the response (like salivation). 

- In NLP, the unconditioned stimulus is achieving a desired emotional state through focus and physiology. The conditioned stimulus, or "anchor," is something like shouting "yes!" and clapping, which is paired with the state. Repeating this can lead to the anchor alone eliciting the state.

- Anchoring a state of certainty is common. Although shouting "yes!" and clapping may not seem as powerful as Pavlov's stimuli, the underlying mechanism is the same.

- The author was initially skeptical but knew the science behind NLP anchoring was valid, and achieving it could be very useful.

 

The author discovered a technique called olfactory anchoring to help manage emotional states. This built upon neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) anchoring. NLP anchoring involves associating a peak emotional state with a sensory trigger (like a sound or gesture) to help recall that state later. 

The author found two main issues with basic NLP anchoring:

1. It can be hard to reach a peak emotional state on demand. The state needs to be at maximum intensity to properly set the anchor.

2. The sensory trigger needs to be dramatic and unusual to be effective. Common triggers don’t work as well. 

The author developed olfactory anchoring to address these issues. It involves five steps:

1. Choose your desired emotional state. For example, absolute certainty.  

2. Recall a memory where you felt that state intensely. Create a vivid mental picture of the memory. 

3. Adopt the physiology of that state. Stand, speak, breathe, etc. in the way you did when feeling that state. You can use your mental picture as a guide.

4. Intensify your state. Use your five senses to strengthen the emotions from your mental picture. For example, make the picture bigger, louder, more vivid. Move it closer.

5. Set your olfactory anchor. When your state peaks in intensity, associate it with an unusual smell, like peppermint or coffee. This smell will trigger that state in the future.

In summary, olfactory anchoring enhances the basic NLP technique by helping reach a peak state and by using a powerful olfactory trigger. With practice, this can be a highly effective way to manage your emotional states.

 

The key ideas are:

1. Motion pictures and visual images evoke more intense emotions than still pictures. This is analogous to how we intensify our mental states using our senses.

2. The movie industry evolved by making the visual experience bigger, brighter and more realistic. At a certain point, the trend reversed as the experience became too intense. We can apply the same techniques to intensify our mental images, but should avoid going overboard.

3. To set an anchor (according to NLP), you go through a 5-step process:

1. Choose a resourceful state 
2. Intensify the state using your 5 senses
3. Reach the pinnacle of that state  
4. Set an anchor (word, gesture) to capture that peak state
5. Test and strengthen the anchor

4. The author struggled with the 5-step process and found it difficult to truly reach an absolute peak state of certainty. Much of the perceived success with setting anchors at events is due to self-delusion and a desire to go along with the crowd.

5. The breakthrough came when the author started using smell (an odor called BoomBoom) to set an anchor, eliminating steps 2 through 4. This resulted in a simplified 2-step “olfactory anchoring” process:

1. Choose a resourceful state 
2. Set an anchor using smell to capture that state

6. Using smell (olfactory) anchors is more foolproof because smells have a strong, visceral link to memory and emotion. This bypass of an artificial intensification process avoids the risk of self-delusion.

That covers the key highlights and main ideas from the passage on using olfactory anchoring to set powerful state anchors. Please let me know if you would like me to explain anything in more detail.

 

The strategy involves using 10 core influencing tonalities to overwhelm your prospect's conscious mind and take control of their inner monologue. When you speak, your prospect is listening to your actual words but also generating their own thoughts in response. By rapidly shifting between different tonalities, you can divert their mental processing power to just keeping up with the additional meanings and associations created by the tonal shifts. This leaves little capacity for that inner critical voice, allowing you to influence them more easily.

For example, saying "Jordan!" in different tonalities creates different unspoken messages:

- Stern tone: "Get over here now! What have you done?!" 
- Sing-song tone: "Where are you, my love? Come out, come out!"

In a sales call, when you say "Hi, my name is Bill Peterson, calling from Acme Travel Company. I'm looking for Mr. John Smith. Is he home?", the prospect will likely suspect you're a salesperson. Their inner monologue will be analyzing your actual words but also judging the likelihood of your being a telemarketer.

By using the 10 influencing tonalities, you can overwhelm their conscious processing, control their inner monologue, and influence them before that critical inner voice has a chance to resist. The key is to shift rapidly between tonalities to divert their mental capacity into just keeping up with the additional meanings being generated.

The 10 core influencing tonalities are: Stern, Sing-Song, Monotone, Surprised, Whispered, Booming, Fast, Slow, Loud, Soft. Mastering them and using them strategically is key to this unconscious communication strategy.

 

- The author discusses the importance of using the proper tonality when communicating. Born salespeople automatically apply the right tonality, but most people struggle with this.

- There are 10 core influencing tonalities, like sounding sincere, caring, reasonable, etc. Using the right tonality helps build emotional connection and influence the other person. 

- The author gives an example of a sales call gone wrong because the salesperson failed to use the proper tonality. The prospect's inner monologue rejected the call before the salesperson even started.

- To illustrate using tonality properly, the author revisits the same sales call example. This time, the salesperson addresses the prospect casually and enthusiastically, showing genuine interest. This helps build rapport and influence the prospect's inner monologue.

- Another example of using tonality to influence is phrasing declaratives as questions. This taps into human desires to seem agreeable and not be out of the loop. It implies microagreements and influences the other person without them realizing.

- The author shares an example of his daughter using this technique to convince him to go to the toy store. By phrasing it as questions, it caused him to search his memory and doubt himself.

- In summary, using the proper tonality is key to effective communication and influence. It allows you to connect emotionally and steer the other person's inner thoughts without them recognizing the influence.

 

The author describes using tonality to influence a prospect's decision making. There are four core influencing tonalities:

1. Question tonality: Phrasing statements as questions to put the prospect's mind in "search mode" and paralyze their internal resistance. This opens them up to further influence. 

2. Mystery and intrigue: Lowering your voice to imply secrecy and create a sense of urgency and scarcity. This dramatically increases the likelihood of compliance.

3. Scarcity: Creating a perception of limited supply to increase desire. There are three types:

- Verbal scarcity: Using words to convey limited availability. E.g. "We only have one left."

- Tonal scarcity: Lowering your voice to a whisper to intensify the feeling of scarcity. 

- Informational scarcity: Implying the information itself is limited, like a secret.

4. Certainty, sincerity, and reasonableness: Using these tonalities when asking for the order:

- Absolute certainty: A firm, confident tone to convey conviction.

- Utter sincerity: A smooth, humble tone implying you're speaking from the heart.

- Reasonable man: Raising your voice at the end of a sentence to imply reasonableness and encourage reciprocation. E.g. "Got a minute?"

The author recommends transitioning between these tonalities at key points in the sales process to maximize influence over the prospect's decision making. Using them strategically and sparingly is key. Focusing on choosing the right words and applying the right tonality for each sentence allows you to maintain control of the prospect's internal monologue and the overall sales encounter.

 Here’s a summary:

• Body language is extremely powerful and impacts people’s impressions of you immediately. Ineffective or negative body language can ruin your chances of building rapport and closing a sale. 

• When people first meet you, they make a snap judgment about you in 1/24th of a second based on your appearance and body language. They mentally evaluate you and determine if you seem like someone they want to do business with.

• Examples of negative or repulsive body language include: invading someone’s personal space, poor eye contact, a weak handshake, disheveled appearance, weird gestures or movements. This type of body language creates a visceral negative reaction that is hard to overcome.

• A story is told of an Australian man who approached the author at a seminar and invaded his personal space while trying to pitch his product, an “Express Loo.” His aggressive and off-putting body language ruined any chance of the author or others taking him or his product seriously. 

• In summary, effective body language won’t necessarily close a sale on its own but poor or off-putting body language can easily destroy the opportunity to make a sale by preventing you from building rapport and trust. You must master proper body language and appearance to be persuasive.

The key highlights are: body language is extremely powerful; people make snap judgments of you based on your body language and appearance; negative body language destroys sales opportunities; and you must have proper body language to build rapport and be persuasive.

 

• People are quick to judge based on appearances like how you dress, groom yourself, jewelry, etc. This is unfortunate but human nature. 

• For men, wearing a suit and tie conveys power and credibility. For women, a power suit or professional skirt communicates the same. Excessive makeup, perfume or jewelry for women can undermine credibility.

• Facial hair for men should be closely cropped or clean shaven. Unkempt beards convey untrustworthiness. Excessive or extreme hairstyles for women also undermine credibility.

• Pinky rings for men and excessive jewelry for both men and women are perceived negatively. 

• It's best to dress in a style congruent with your profession. Plumbers in suits and salespeople in gym clothes won't inspire confidence.

• Body language and tone are more important than words for building rapport. For men communicating with men, stand at an angle rather than face to face. For men talking to women, stand facing them. Women should do the opposite.

• Maintain an appropriate social distance of 2 to 3 feet in Western culture. Less space is typical in Asia. 

• A proper handshake is important. Limp, "dead fish" handshakes or overly aggressive handshakes make a bad impression. A neutral, "cooperator's" handshake where pressure is matched is best.

• Make eye contact around 70% of the time to appear trustworthy. Staring too much risks a "stare off".

• Matching another's tone, body language and pressure are ways to build rapport. But avoid escalating tensions with overly aggressive handshakes or stares.

 

- Pay attention to body language and match the prospect. Matching body language, facial expressions and speech patterns helps build rapport. Match about 72% of the time. Don't overdo it, or it seems insincere. 
- Crossed arms can indicate being closed off, but don't assume. It could just mean the person is cold. 
- When you match someone's body language, they will often unconsciously match you back. This is called pacing and leading. You match them (pace) and then make a change (lead) that they follow. 
- Active listening - using body language and verbal cues like "aha" and "hmm" to show you are engaged - builds rapport. Nodding, appropriate facial expressions and leaning in show you care. 
- Matching works over the phone too by matching speech patterns, speed and word choice. 
- An example of pacing and leading: Matching an angry person's anger at first to build rapport, then softening your tone to calm them down, and having them follow your lead. 
- To demonstrate pacing, the author describes an exercise where he asks someone to "sell him this pen." A cocky salesperson dove right in touting the pen, but that is not the right approach. 
- The right approach is to ask questions to gather information about the prospect's needs and see if the pen is a fit before launching into a sales pitch. This also builds rapport by showing interest in the prospect.

 Here’s a summary:

The passage describes a scenario where a young man tries to sell a pen to the narrator by making exaggerated claims about the pen without first qualifying whether the narrator is even interested in buying a pen. The narrator calls out the young man for his poor sales technique and asks his colleague Danny to demonstrate the right way to sell the pen. Danny refuses to sell the pen after realizing the narrator doesn’t need it. 

The key lessons are:

1. You cannot sell something to someone who does not need or want it. It’s a waste of time.

2. Qualifying a prospect by asking them questions to determine their needs and interests is crucial before launching into a sales pitch. 

3. Making a good first impression by appearing as a confident expert in your field is key to getting prospects to honestly answer your qualifying questions. Without this, they may avoid answering or try to take control of the conversation.

4. The ability to gather information from prospects depends on the power of your first impression. Prospects will only open up to those they perceive as experts who can help them.

5. Marketing and sales work together. Marketing identifies potential customers, gets them into the sales funnel, and passes them to sales to turn into actual customers.

6. There are offline and online marketing strategies to reach potential customers. Whatever method is used, the goal is to prompt people to enter the company's sales funnel.

7. Straight Line prospecting serves as the bridge between marketing and sales. It is a systematic process for qualifying interested prospects and gathering the information needed to determine if they are viable customers before pitching them.

 

The ultimate goal of any marketing campaign is to bring qualified buyers into the sales funnel so the sales team can turn them into customers. However, not all prospects who enter the funnel will become buyers. The key is to efficiently sift through the prospects to identify and focus on the most qualified ones. 

There are four types of buyers that enter the sales funnel:

1. Buyers in heat: The most motivated buyers, ready to buy now. They make up 10-20% of prospects.

2. Buyers in power: Intend to buy but lack urgency. They make up 30-40% of prospects. 

3. Lookie-loos: Pretend to be interested but have no intention of buying. They waste time and damage morale. Identify and remove them quickly.

4. Mistakes: Entered the funnel by accident or were dragged in by someone else. Have no desire to buy. Remove them quickly.

The goals of prospecting are:

1. Identify and remove lookie-loos and mistakes quickly. 

2. Gather intelligence from buyers in heat and power and move them towards a sale.

3. Turn buyers in power into buyers in heat by amplifying their pain.

The 10 rules of prospecting provide a blueprint for gathering intelligence:

1. You’re a sifter, not an alchemist. Sift through many prospects to find gold, don’t expect prospects to turn into buyers magically.

2. Always ask for permission to ask questions. This builds rapport and makes the prospect feel in control. 

3. Focus on pain, problems, and needs—not your product. Ask questions to understand the prospect’s situation and identify how you can help. 

4. Ask open-ended questions. This encourages the prospect to share detailed information. Close-ended questions limit responses.

5. Listen and probe. Pay close attention to the prospect’s answers and ask follow-up questions to gain valuable insights. 
 6. Share a relevant story or case study. Illustrate how you’ve helped a similar client. But keep it brief—no more than 2 minutes.

7. Explain the value. Briefly summarize how you can solve the prospect’s key problem or satisfy their biggest need. But don’t pitch your product yet.

8. Set a clear next step. For example, schedule a follow-up call or meeting to explore solutions. Ask the prospect’s permission to do so.

9. Put prospects in the proper category. Based on the intelligence gathered, determine if they are a buyer in heat, buyer in power, lookie-loo, or mistake. Take the appropriate next action. 

10. Continuously improve your questions and listening skills. Regularly evaluate and enhance your prospecting process. Stay up-to-date with your market and industry. Continuous improvement is key.

The summary highlights the key elements involved in effective prospecting according to the Straight Line methodology. The ultimate goals and rules provide a useful framework for developing and improving one's prospecting skills.

 

• Avoid acting like an Inquisitor who does not care about the prospect or understand them. Instead, build rapport by asking for permission to ask questions and showing you are there to serve the prospect. 

• Use short scripts with "so" as a justifier to efficiently gather information while maintaining rapport. For example, say something like: "John, just a couple of quick questions, so I can best serve you."

• Start with less invasive questions and progress to more invasive questions as rapport builds through desensitization. For example, don't start by asking about income and finances. Build up to those questions.

• Use the appropriate tonality for each question. For example, use a caring and concerned tonality for questions about pain points, fears, or problems. Use an enthusiastic and curious tonality for questions about goals, vision, or dreams.

• Demonstrate active listening through body language like nodding, leaning in, making eye contact, compressing lips, etc. This shows you understand, care, and are engaged with the prospect's responses. 

• The key is building trust and rapport so you can have an effective intelligence gathering session. Rapport paves the way for the prospect to open up and provide the information you need. Maintaining rapport requires using the right language, tonality, and body language with sensitivity to the prospect.

 Here’s a summary:

To actively listen to your prospects:

1. Make eye contact and nod slowly to show you understand their pain. 

2. Say “oohs,” “aahs,” and “yups” to indicate you’re engaged. This works on the phone, too.

3. Lean forward when asking emotional questions, then keep leaning in as they answer. Lean back for logical questions.

4. Follow a logical sequence of questions. Ask follow-ups to get details. Exhaust each line of questioning before moving on.

5. Don’t resolve their pain yet. Amplify it by asking how it will worsen if unaddressed. This helps them feel the urgency to act.

6. End with a powerful transition to either continue the sale or send them elsewhere if it’s not a good fit. Build goodwill by recommending other options. 

7. Stay focused on the goals of your questions. Don’t get distracted by tangents. Bring the conversation back to what you need to know to determine if they’re qualified.

The keys are listening fully, asking targeted questions in a logical flow, keeping the conversation centered on their needs and your solution, and moving the good prospects forward while eliminating bad fits. Master these skills, and you’ll be well on your way to sales success.

 

The story describes how duck hunting in the Kent marshes of England was renowned as the best in the country. However, the salesman in the story pretended to be interested in duck hunting to build rapport with a prospect, even though he knew nothing about it. This backfired and caused the prospect to lose interest. 

The key points about building rapport are:

1) Genuine rapport is based on caring about the prospect and finding commonalities with them. It is not pretending to share interests that you do not actually have.

2) When a prospect goes off on a tangent, use active listening to build rapport. Let them talk, show you understand and are interested. Then gently bring them back to the main topic. 

3) Rapport is not constant and goes up and down. It depends on how the prospect feels about the last thing you said and whether they think you are on the same page. If it’s positive, rapport increases. If negative, it decreases.

4) You cannot close a sale without rapport. If you sense it decreasing, stop and work to actively rebuild it.

The example shows what not to do and the principles to follow to build real rapport. The key is finding actual common ground and showing genuine interest in the prospect, not faking it. Active listening is a skill that can be used even when interests differ to keep the rapport going. But the interests and goals you truly share are the most powerful.

 

- Charisma is an essential quality for salespeople and consists of effective tonality, targeted body language, and not saying stupid things. Charisma can be developed and is made up of learnable skills.

- The Straight Line System helps salespeople sound like experts through the use of scripts. Straight Line scripts represent the essence of a perfect sale by combining a salesperson's best examples into a single, structured template.

- Benefits of using Straight Line scripts include: 

1. Preventing salespeople from saying stupid things, even in long, dragged out sales encounters.

2. Allowing salespeople to plan tonalities in advance to take control of prospects' thoughts.  

3. Ensuring salespeople always say the best words, even when nervous or inexperienced.  

4. Allowing salespeople to focus on prospect reactions by reducing the need to come up with the right words spontaneously. This helps gauge certainty and notice dips in rapport.

5. Allowing salespeople to make an airtight case for each Ten while following Straight Line rules to maximize engagement and closing rates.  

6. Allowing companies to systemize and standardize their sales presentations across regions and channels. This is important for growth and expansion.  

7. Reducing regulatory issues by preventing exaggeration and falsehoods which often come from saying stupid things spontaneously. Two types of stupid things: truthful/accurate or false/misleading. Scripts eliminate both.

The two specific tonalities you mentioned, ‘I care (I really want to know)’ and ‘I feel your pain,’ relate to demonstrating charisma and building rapport through conveying care, understanding, and empathy. These help create a sense of collaboration and trust.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key ideas and specific points related to charisma, Straight Line scripts, and the benefits of their use? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 

• There are many benefits to using sales scripts that follow the Straight Line System's eight rules. However, many salespeople have a negative view of scripts due to three main concerns: sounding wooden or inauthentic, prospects detecting the use of a script, and perceiving scripts as unethical or lacking integrity. 

• The author gives an example of seeing a poorly written sales script that was ineffective and even "sucking the life" out of the sales team using it. He ended up destroying this script to emphasize the need for a well-written "straight line" script.

• The author uses the movie Braveheart as an analogy to explain that expertly written and delivered scripts can be very impactful, just like Mel Gibson's motivational speech in that movie. The key is to become proficient in reading from a script naturally and writing a script that sounds natural when read. 

• The philosophy of "strategic preparation" involves anticipating everything that might come up in a sale and preparing the best possible responses. This level of preparation and using well-crafted scripts allows one to sound natural and authentic.

• The summary points are: 1) there are many benefits to good sales scripts, 2) poor scripts are ineffective and even harmful, 3) impactful scripts and performances require expertise and skill, and 4) strategic preparation and good scripts allow one to sound natural and authentic.

The key ideas are around the skill and preparation required to use sales scripts in an effective, authentic-seeming manner. Poorly written or delivered scripts will not achieve the desired results and may even be counterproductive. But expertise in writing, reading, and preparing scripts can lead to success.

 

The key features of an effective Straight Line script are:

1. It is not front-loaded. It discloses benefits gradually to handle objections. 

2. It focuses on benefits, not features. While features are mentioned, the focus is on why the benefits matter to the prospect.

3. It has stopping-off points. Powerful statements are followed by questions to confirm understanding and build rapport. This keeps the prospect engaged.

4. It is written in spoken, casual language. The script should sound natural and connect emotionally, while still conveying expertise. Colloquialisms and contractions are used. 

5. It flows perfectly. The script is refined through multiple drafts to ensure a smooth rhythm, balance, and flow. This allows even novice salespeople to sound polished.

6. It is honest and ethical. The script is 100% accurate and transparent. Exaggeration, misleading claims, and important omissions are avoided. Unethical scripts will destroy a company culture.

7. It considers the energy in, benefits out equation. Before buying, prospects weigh the energy required to buy versus the expected benefits. If benefits outweigh energy, the prospect will consider buying. The script must satisfy this equation.

In summary, an effective Straight Line script is gradually revealed, benefit-focused, interactive, conversational, refined, ethical, and satisfies the prospect's energy-benefit analysis. The script is the truth, compellingly told.

 

- When a salesperson asks a prospect for an order, the prospect's mind unconsciously evaluates whether the benefits outweigh the required effort and energy. If the outcome is negative, the prospect will not buy at that time. The salesperson then has another chance to ask for the order again using principles to get the right outcome.

- Two examples, Bill and John, illustrate this. If Bill asks John to do many complicated tasks to get the product, John will likely say no because the effort outweighs the benefits. If Bill instead highlights the benefits and says getting started is simple, John will more likely buy. 

- It's important to restate benefits when asking for an order or responding to buy signals, even if stated before, because people quickly forget the benefits. For example, if a prospect asks about the price again, restate the key benefits to balance the cost in the prospect's mind.

- A Straight Line script is one of several scripts in a full sales process. There are scripts for the opening, main presentation, objections, looping, etc. The scripts depend on the number of contacts, e.g. one call vs. multiple calls. Multiple calls allow building rapport and tailoring the pitch to the prospect.

- The bottom line is that the ease of getting started and benefits to the customer must outweigh the effort and cost required. Matching language to the prospect's preferred representational system, using vivid examples, future pacing the benefits, and other techniques can help achieve the right balance to get the sale.

 

• The summary describes the Straight Line System as visually representing the perfect sale where the prospect says yes to everything and ultimately agrees to close the deal. 

• The goal is to increase the prospect’s certainty for each of the Three Tens - the product, the salesperson, and the company - to the highest level, which is a 10.

• The order of creating certainty is:

1. The product 
2. The salesperson
3. The company

• Logical cases are built first, followed by emotional cases. The logical cases satisfy the prospect’s skepticism so they can then be moved emotionally.

• Straight Line scripts with embedded language patterns are used. The scripts ensure the salesperson knows what to say, and the language patterns have specific goals, e.g. creating logical or emotional certainty, addressing each of the Three Tens, lowering the action threshold, adding pain.

• In the first half of the sale, the language patterns anchor each step. In the second half, they form the foundation for intensifying the emotional aspects and closing the sale.

• The summary emphasizes paying close attention to the number of calls required to close a sale. Extra calls are usually due to problems that can be addressed, e.g. inexperienced salespeople, a flawed sales process. Reducing the number of calls can increase the close rate.

• The summary notes components of the waiting period in a four-call close, including keeping in touch, sending testimonials and relevant articles, and maintaining rapport. Communication should convey that the deal is considered closed.

 

Your opening pattern is where you introduce yourself, your company, and the reason for your call to establish rapport and gain control of the conversation. Use power words, ask for permission to ask questions, and speak enthusiastically. 

Your next pattern transitions into asking questions to gather information. Ask open-ended questions about their current supplier, biggest challenges, and ideal solution. Identify their highest need. Ask if you’ve covered everything. 

Recap your introduction, including using a “recall” statement to link your prospect to a previous interaction, your “justifier” for the call, asking for permission to ask questions, and a transition statement to move into your presentation.

For the presentation, start with the name of your offering. Focus on one key benefit that matches their need. Use comparisons and credibility from respected sources. Ask if they follow to maintain rapport. Repeat with a couple more patterns, being careful not to overwhelm them.

Create urgency for why they should buy now, either through inherent urgency in your industry or your tone. Transition by explaining the simple process to get started. 

Directly ask for the order, ideally 3-4 times. Use a pattern like, “Give me one shot, and believe me, if I’m even half-right, the only problem you’ll have is that I didn't call you six months ago and get you started then. Sound fair enough?”

The final steps are training, drilling, and practice. Scripts are essential, but proper delivery and the ability to handle objections are also key. With practice, these techniques can help close more deals.

The key themes throughout the process are: build rapport and credibility, identify needs and pain points, match your solution to those needs, create urgency and ask for the sale. Using a systematic approach with the proper language and tonality at each stage can make you much more effective. But ultimately, practice and experience are required to become truly proficient.

 

• Focus on the massive payoff of practicing and memorizing your script. Scripts dramatically increase your closing rate, even if you’re just okay at writing them. 

• Always use a script, whether selling in-person or on the phone. Memorize the script so you can focus on tonality and body language.

• There are only three possible responses to asking for the order: yes (lay-down sale), no (rare), or maybe (common objections). Manage expectations and don't expect lay-downs.

• The "maybe" objections fall into common categories. Use deflection techniques like the reasonable man close to address them.

• An example script for a stockbroker shows how to reengage a prospect, set up the presentation, ask for a large initial order to allow for incremental decreases, and ultimately land at the firm's minimum. 

• Practicing the script leads to unconscious competence and the ability to focus on the 90% of communication that isn't words. The sale really starts after the first objection, so prepare for that.

• This approach can apply to any type of selling, not just for stockbrokers. The principles are universal.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key highlights and main takeaways from the material? Let me know if you have any other questions.

 

The strategy uses a step-down sale, where you reduce the amount of the purchase over multiple closing attempts. For example, you ask the prospect to buy 10,000 shares, then reduce to 5,000 shares, then 1,000 shares and so on. This reduces the perceived risk for the prospect while increasing the benefits. It significantly increases the closing rate.  

You expect objections and have standard responses. For example, if the prospect says “Let me think about it”, you say “I understand. Does the idea make sense? Do you like it?”. This deflects the objection by acknowledging it but moving the conversation to determining the prospect’s certainty.  

You gauge the prospect’s certainty level based on their response and enthusiasm. A very enthusiastic “Absolutely, I love it!” is around a 10, indicating high certainty. A dismissive “I guess so” is around a 4, indicating low certainty. An ambivalent “Yeah, it sounds pretty good” is around a 6.

If the certainty is too low, like a 6, you loop back to your presentation to build more logical and emotional certainty before attempting to close again. You continue your logical case and use “pace, pace, lead” tonality to build emotional certainty.  No matter the response, you have a standard reply like “Exactly—it really is a great buy down here!” and continue your follow-up presentation.

The goal is to get logical and emotional certainty as close to 10 as possible before closing. With high certainty, the prospect will be willing to buy.

 

You're going to respond to Bill using the exact same words each time but vary your tonality. Specifically, you'll use the strategy of pace, pace, lead to mirror Bill's level of certainty and gradually increase it.

For responses between 5 to 7 on the certainty scale, you'll say:

"Exactly! It really is a great buy at this level! In fact, one of the true beauties here is..."  

Then launch into your compelling follow-up presentation. At the end, ask enthusiastically while maintaining peak tonality:

"You see what I'm saying here, Bill? Do you like the idea?"

To get an 8 or above, which cracks the first number in the buying code, you want an enthusiastic "Absolutely! I love the idea! It makes total sense to me!" Your equally enthusiastic reply:

"Exactly! The stock really is a screaming buy down here!"  

This closes the pattern and raises certainty to at least 9 logically and 7 emotionally. 

However, don't ask for the sale yet. Focus on the second Ten instead: connection and trust in you. Use two language patterns:

1. Ask a profound question in a mysterious, intriguing tone to imply it's unrelated to the previous exchange:

"I have a question for you, Bill, and I'm really curious as to how you would answer this..."

2. Share a personal story that demonstrates your competence and trustworthiness to build a human connection. For example:

"Let me share a quick story with you that will give you a good sense of how my clients and I work together..."

These strategies will raise the second Ten and set you up to address the third Ten: desire and motivation. From there, you can determine Bill's buying strategy and combination to lock in the sale.

 

The key point is that once the prospect admits it’s a lack of trust holding them back, not their stated objection, it’s a turning point. You’ve gotten to the real issue.

To build trust quickly, use the “Forrest Gump pattern.” This means:

1. Express understanding for their lack of trust since you have no track record. 

2. Reintroduce yourself, giving details to build credibility like:

- Your full name and title

- How long you’ve been in your role/company

- Any degrees, licenses, awards, talents, goals, ethics that make you valuable to the prospect

- Take as long as needed to be transparent and build rapport 

3. Explain how you’ve helped other clients in a sincere, straightforward way. Give real examples and stories to build trust through shared experiences. 

4. Highlight key benefits you’ve provided to other clients to show the prospect the kind of value you can offer them.

5. Express genuine interest in the prospect’s needs and priorities. This shows you care about them, not just making a sale. 

The key is sincerity and transparency. Swing the pendulum of trust by opening up, showing real evidence of your abilities and integrity, and focusing on the prospect’s interests. If done well, you can gain a high level of trust in a short time, moving a skeptical prospect to become a strong advocate. But balance extremes—the truth typically lies in the middle.

So in summary, the Forrest Gump pattern is a powerful way to build trust quickly by being genuine and vulnerable while highlighting your abilities, values, and client benefits. This can turn around a distrustful prospect by meeting their real objection and building a personal connection.

 

- After going through the first loop (Forrest Gump pattern) to address the first objection, you will likely get hit with a second objection from the prospect. Unlike the first objection, you will need to address the second objection directly instead of deflecting. 

- However, simply responding to the objection and asking for the order again will likely not work. This is because the objections are usually smoke screens for uncertainty, not real objections. The prospect will just move on to another objection.

- Instead, you should use your rebuttal to the second objection as a way to continue the conversation and transition back into your sales pitch. Keep building your logical and emotional cases to increase the prospect's certainty in the three tens: the product, yourself, and the company. 

- Some examples of rebuttals that transition well back into the sales pitch:

1) "I hear what you're saying, but let me just say that I've been doing this for quite some time now, and if there's one thing I've learned it's that when people say they're going to think about it, or call you back, what ends up happening is that they end up putting the idea in the back of their mind and deciding against it, not because they don’t like the idea—in fact, in your case I know that you actually do—but the simple fact is that we’re both very busy people, and you’ll go back to your busy life and end up missing out on this; and I don’t want to see that happen to you."

2) "Frankly, that's a smart question, and here's what I've found in my experience..."

3) "I can understand why that would seem concerning. Let me give you a bit more context that should help clarify..."

- The key is to not get derailed by the objections and to keep steering the conversation back to building your case. If required, you may need to run additional loops to continue addressing uncertainty and lowering the prospect's action threshold. The goal is to get to a point where the pain of not buying exceeds the pain of taking action.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key points about running your second and third loops? Let me know if you have any other questions!

 

To move your prospect to an even higher level of certainty for each of the Three Tens (problem, solution, credibility), use secondary language patterns that you created for this purpose. Rather than going straight to the close after the first loop, run an extremely powerful language pattern that will allow you to determine your prospect’s action threshold.

The action threshold is the level of certainty a person needs to feel comfortable buying. People with low action thresholds, like the author, are easy to sell to because a 7, 8, 7 on the certainty scale is enough. For people with high action thresholds, like the author’s father, only 10, 10, 10 will prompt a purchase. 

There are four ways to lower a prospect’s action threshold:

1. Offer a money-back guarantee. This reduces the risk of not getting what the prospect thought they were paying for.

2. Offer a cooling-off or rescission period. This allows the prospect to reverse the decision for a few days. Common in real estate and vacation sales.

3. Use key phrases that counter worries, e.g. “I’ll hold your hand every step of the way,” “We pride ourselves on long-term relationships,” “We have blue-chip customer service.”

4. Use a language pattern to temporarily reverse the prospect’s parallel movies. Get them to run an unrealistically short negative movie and long, empowering positive movie rather than the reverse. 

The difference between low- and high-action-threshold people is the length and toxicity of the movies they run. Low-threshold people run a long positive movie and short, not very toxic negative one. High-threshold people do the reverse. The language pattern addresses this.

 

- The author’s father has a very high action threshold, meaning he takes a long time to make buying decisions. He envisions many potential negative outcomes before making a purchase. 

- To overcome a high action threshold prospect like this, the salesperson should reframe their thinking to focus on the potential benefits and rewards of the purchase rather than the potential downsides. They should highlight how little negative impact a wrong decision may have while emphasizing the potential upside. This helps the prospect think more positively and lowers their action threshold.

- Additional “loops” or interactions may be required to fully convince a high action threshold prospect. At a minimum, one more loop addressing the prospect’s “pain threshold” is needed. The salesperson should re-emphasize the pain or problem that their product or service solves to motivate the prospect to take action. Descriptions of the prospect’s situation worsening over time can be particularly persuasive. 

- With each loop, the salesperson should re-sell the benefits, using emotive language to help the prospect visualize how much better the future will be with the solution in place. A “soft close” again asking for the sale can then be employed. 

- In general, higher action threshold prospects require more loops and interactions to convince but often become very loyal customers once convinced due to the effort required to earn their trust and confidence. They tend to be less price-sensitive and not easily swayed to competitors once a relationship is established.

The key takeaway is that high action threshold prospects can absolutely be convinced to buy, but it requires skill and persistence to navigate their concerns and lower their threshold through emotive and compelling presentations of benefits and solutions.

 

• No matter how persuasive your rebuttal is, it will only earn you the right to speak more. What really persuades people is what you say after the rebuttal.

• If the prospect continues to have the same objection, thank them and move on. Don't pressure them into repeating yourself over and over. 

• Pay attention to the prospect's body language and tone to determine if they're feeling pressured. If so, pull back immediately and ease the tension. Say something like, "Don't mistake my enthusiasm for pressure."

• You then have two options:

1. Give the sale one more shot, while staying conscious of your tone and body language. Focus on sincerity and empathy. Watch the prospect for signs of pressure. If detected, move to option 2.

2. Get back into rapport, end on a high note, and set up a follow-up call. For example, say, "Let me email you that information. Review it and discuss with your wife. We'll speak again next week once you've considered everything. Sound good?"

• Whether you call the prospect back or have them call you depends on your industry's callback success rate. Higher rate, have them call you. Lower rate, call them back. 

• Never forget the ethical side. Don't use pain to disempower people, use it to empower them to make good buying decisions and get what they need.

• Be flexible in applying the Straight Line System to your particular industry. Adapt the language patterns to fit your situation. With tweaking, the system can work in any industry.

• Success comes from mastering persuasion through the Straight Line System while maintaining ethics and integrity.
