 Here is a summary:

• Social proof - people's tendency to assume others' actions signal correct behavior - depends on observability, how much people can see what others do. Publicly visible behaviors and products have more significant influence.

• Making the private public, e.g., through behavioral residue, generates social proof. This includes promotional items, social media posts, and online reviews. However, too much publicity can sometimes backfire.

• Practically valuable information, like how-to's, life hacks, and recommendations that save people time, money or help them have good experiences, is highly shareable. The more useful information is, the more viral it will be.

• According to prospect theory, we evaluate things relative to a reference point, not objectively. How good or bad something seems depends on what we compare it to. Infomercials and retailers manipulate reference points to make their deals seem more significant.

• Diminishing sensitivity means we care more about saving money on cheaper items. We would go further to save on a clock radio than a TV, even though it's the same amount saved. Percentage discounts seem more sizable for low-cost products. Absolute discounts matter more for expensive products.

• Deals that provide incredible value, especially relative to expectations, tend to spread more. Scarcity and exclusivity amplify a deal's perceived value. For under $100 products, frame the deal using percentages. For over $100 products, emphasize the total $ amount saved.

• In summary, leveraging social influence through increased observability, providing practical value, manipulating reference points, and crafting shareable deals are effective strategies companies can use to shape perceptions and drive business. But these techniques can sometimes be double-edged swords.

 Here is a summary of the key concepts:

Social currency: We share information that makes us look good to others and signals our value. Brands can create social currency by providing shareable content that makes people appear excited, in the know, or plugged-in. Snapple's Real Facts and sharing news/ gossip are examples.

Reciprocity: Sharing is a form of social exchange. We share to get information and social benefits in return.

Scarcity: We share unique, scarce information that seems exclusive or hard to obtain. Limited availability makes things seem more valuable. 

Triggers: Frequently triggered ideas spread more. Environmental cues, core beliefs, and contexts act as triggers, influencing what comes to mind and spreads. Examples are Honey Nut Cheerios, the Mars rover landing, and Rebecca Black's "Friday" video.

Emotion: High arousal emotions, whether positive or negative, drive sharing. Emotional news articles and ads are more likely to spread. Backlash can arise from extremely negative emotions.

Stories: Interesting and entertaining stories spread through word-of-mouth. The Blair Witch Project and black toilet paper show how stories generate buzz.

Public visibility: Seeing others do something makes us more likely to do the same through social influence. Public behavior influences preferences, opinions, and choices. Apple's ads maximized social influence through emotion, visibility, and simplicity.

Practical value: Things that seem useful or valuable spread more. "On-sale" or limited availability items seem more valuable through the practical value heuristic. The absolute and relative size of a discount impacts how people perceive its practical value.

Social influence: Public visibility and behavior influence individual choices, consumer preferences, tax payment, alcohol use, organ donation, and more. Social proof refers to looking to others in uncertain situations to guide behavior. Decreasing observability and addressing pluralistic ignorance can reduce social influence.  

Heuristics: Mental shortcuts like practical value, prospect theory (framing effects), and mental accounting (categorizing options subjectively) significantly impact judgment and choice. Brands leverage heuristics to drive perception and sales.

A multi-pronged strategy using social influence, heuristics, and multiple STEPPS elements produces the most significant effects. Nuanced messages resonate most strongly with audiences.

 Here is a summary of the key comparisons made:

- Studies showing no autism-vaccine link vs. debunked claim of a link. The facts demonstrate the claim is misinformation.

- Estimated date of around 1170 BC for the Trojan Horse story based on The Odyssey eclipse vs. other time periods. This provides evidence for when the story likely took place.

- Stories as more persuasive than facts alone. Stories are "transporting" and make counterarguments harder vs. facts which are less engaging and impactful. 

- Success of Jared Fogle/Subway campaign and Dove "Evolution" film featuring stories vs. typical ads focused on product features and attributes. Stories resonated more with audiences.

- Only 2% of women consider themselves beautiful according to research vs. portrayal of beauty in media. Dove's "Evolution" film tackled unrealistic societal beauty standards.

- Success of some viral campaigns like Ron Bensimhon's tutu video vs. failure of other viral efforts like Evian's "Roller Babies" to boost sales. Virality does not always translate to business success.  

- Ad with father speaking for over a minute about a blender without mentioning the product vs. valuable virality coming from interesting, buzzworthy content, not just any viral idea.

- Rumor spread findings of Allport and Postman vs. the greater persuasiveness of stories over facts alone. Stories are more "transporting" and harder to counterargue. 

- Popularity of Vietnamese nail salons driven by Thuan Le vs. success of other immigrant groups in dominating industries like Cambodians and donuts, Koreans and dry cleaners, Chinese and restaurants. Cultural learning and word-of-mouth drive these trends.  

- Duncan Watts' comparison of influentials to Paul Revere vs. the spreading of ideas through the network and herd. Word-of-mouth comes more from the overall network than select influencers.

The key comparisons contrast examples, evidence, facts, studies, and theories to highlight the main points around why certain stories, ideas, and products catch on while others do not. Let me know if you would like me to explain or expand on any part of the summary.
