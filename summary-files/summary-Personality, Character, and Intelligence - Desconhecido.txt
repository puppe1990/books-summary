 

Malcolm Gladwell is a staff writer for The New Yorker and the author of several books, including The Tipping Point, Blink, and Outliers. 

This book, What the Dog Saw, is a collection of Gladwell's favorite articles from The New Yorker, organized into three sections:

1. Obsessives and Minor Geniuses: Profiles of people like Ron Popeil, who sold the Chop-O-Matic, and Shirley Polykoff, who came up with the famous hair color ad “Does she or doesn’t she?”

2. Theories: Ways of making sense of the world, like how to think about homelessness, financial scandals, or disasters like the Challenger crash. 

3. Predictions: How we try to predict who is bad, smart, or capable. Gladwell is skeptical of how good we are at making these judgments.

The book explores what goes on inside people's heads—like what made Cesar Millan able to calm troubled dogs or what goes through a radiologist's mind when reading mammograms. Gladwell tries to satisfy the curiosity we all have about how other people experience the world through their work and daily lives.

Gladwell gets story ideas by convincing himself that everything and everyone has an interesting story to tell. The key is finding the right angle to bring those stories to life and catching people in unguarded moments where they feel free to share colorful details. He says the most fertile territory for stories is often not at the very top with prominent, self-conscious people but in the middle, with the “minor geniuses” doing the actual work in the world.

The collection gives you a glimpse inside the prolific and curious mind of Malcolm Gladwell.

 Here is a summary of the passages:

- Ben Fountain is an American fiction writer who did not start writing professionally until he was 48 years old. Before becoming a writer, he worked as a lawyer. 

- He quit his job as a lawyer to pursue writing full-time, despite not having much experience or training as a writer. He started writing every day, treating it like a job, and slowly improved his craft over many years of practice. 

- After 18 years of rejections, his first book, a short story collection called Brief Encounters with Che Guevara, was published to widespread critical acclaim. His seemingly "sudden" success came after decades of dedication and persisting through failure.

- His story challenges the common notion that genius and creativity are tied to youth. Many examples of creative people, like Fountain himself, produced their best or most famous work later in life. Studies of poets, film directors, and artists have found that creativity can peak at any age. 

- Fountain struggled early on with basic elements of writing like description. His path to success was long and difficult, rather than exhibiting a "bright early burst" of talent. His story demonstrates that persistence, hard work, and a lifetime of practice can shape genius over time. 

- Examples like Picasso fit the stereotype of the young genius, but other artists like Cézanne did their best work late in life. Economists have found that Cézanne's late-career works were valued much higher than his early works. Genius that comes later in life is often underappreciated. 

- In summary, the passage challenges the notion that genius and creativity peak early. Using examples from various fields, it argues that many forms of creative genius develop over long periods of dedication and persistence. Late bloomers like Ben Fountain and Cézanne demonstrate that talent can emerge at any point, and we should reconsider typical notions of when and how genius forms.

 

- Ben Fountain developed an interest in Haiti that grew into the subject for his first novel. He felt he had to travel there extensively, over 30 times, to learn about the place and find inspiration, even though much of that travel was not directly relevant to the needs of the book. This experimental, open-ended approach is characteristic of “late bloomers” in the arts. 

- The psychologist David Galenson argues that there are two types of artists: “conceptual” artists who have a clear idea of where they want to go, like Picasso, and “experimental” artists who discover their work through trial and error, like Cézanne. Late bloomers tend to be experimental artists. They rarely feel they have succeeded and are often plagued by frustration. But they continue to explore and search for long periods before creating their best and most famous works late in their careers.

- The stories Fountain struggled the most to write, like “Near-Extinct Birds of the Central Cordillera,” often turned out the strongest. His novel, years overdue, is still not finished. This painstaking, experimental approach is typical of late bloomers like Twain and Cézanne, who fiddled and despaired for years before creating their masterpieces. 

- We often mistake late bloomers for “late starters” or think they only succeed “late” because the world is slow to appreciate them. But really, late bloomers just take a long time to develop their gifts. Cézanne couldn’t draw well for decades. Their early works may look like failures. It takes time for their complex visions to emerge and cohere. 

- Late bloomers are difficult to recognize and cultivate. Their eventual success is hard-won. But we have to have faith in experimental artists, even when their work looks unpromising, to allow more potential late bloomers to develop and thrive. Many “failures” may simply not have had enough time to bloom.

 

Jonathan Safran Foer became a writer almost by accident. He took creative writing classes at Princeton University mostly "on a whim." However, his professor, Joyce Carol Oates, recognized his talent and told him he had "energy," the most important quality for a writer. He wrote his first novel, Everything Is Illuminated, in just 10 weeks at the age of 19. The novel was inspired by a short trip Foer took to Ukraine to visit the village his grandfather was from. 

In contrast, Ben Fountain did not become a successful writer until his 40s. Unlike Foer, he did not show early signs of literary talent or have any formal training. He worked as a lawyer for many years while slowly honing his craft in his spare time. He made the decision to quit law and focus on writing full-time with the support of his wife, Sharie, who was the primary breadwinner for over a decade while Fountain worked to develop his skills. Sharie's support was essential to Fountain's success, much like the support Cézanne received from Emile Zola, Ambrose Vollard, and Camille Pissarro.

Zola encouraged Cézanne to move to Paris as a young man and provided him with a stipend to help support him. Pissarro then taught Cézanne how to paint. It was not until Vollard sponsored Cézanne's first solo exhibition at the age of 56 that Cézanne achieved success and recognition. Cézanne, like Fountain, required many years of experimentation, practice, and the support of key sponsors and mentors to develop his craft. In the end, their persistence and dedication paid off, but they would not have become the renowned artists they are today without the help of their supporters.

In summary, the stories of Foer, Fountain, and Cézanne show that there are many paths to developing creative talent and achieving artistic success. Early natural ability, formal education, mentorship, dedication, experimentation over time, and finding the right sponsors and platforms for one's work are all potential ingredients - mixed in different measures for each artist. But rarely is success achieved alone. Support from others who believe in the artist's work and potential is often essential, whether that support comes from a dedicated spouse, a mentor, or a patron.

 

- Ambroise Vollard, an art dealer, bought a group of paintings from Paul Cézanne for very little money. One painting fell out of the window as Vollard left. Vollard later sat for 150 sessions to model for a painting by Cézanne that was never finished. 

- Cézanne’s father, Louis-Auguste, supported him financially for his whole life, despite Cézanne showing little promise of success. Other key supporters of Cézanne were the writer Émile Zola, the painter Camille Pissarro, and the art dealer Ambroise Vollard.

- Cézanne’s success was highly dependent on the support and belief of others. His wife and supporters stuck by him even though his paintings were not initially successful or profitable. 

- Success stories of late bloomers like Cézanne are usually love stories, showing how dedication and belief in someone's potential can help them achieve great things, even after a long struggle.

- The summary highlights how Cézanne was able to become a famous artist thanks to key supporters who believed in him and supported him for years before he achieved success and recognition. Though considered a failure by many for a long time, his wife and others stuck by him, which eventually allowed his artistic genius to emerge.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

1. Teacher quality has a huge impact on student learning. Students with a high-quality teacher can learn up to 1.5 years’ worth of material in a single school year compared to students with a low-quality teacher. The impact of teacher quality outweighs the impact of school quality or class size. 

2. Identifying and hiring high-quality teachers is challenging because there are no proven predictors of teacher success. Grades, test scores, degrees, and certifications do not necessarily predict who will become an excellent teacher.

3. College football quarterbacks who thrive in spread offenses often struggle in the NFL. The pro game is much faster and more complex, requiring different skills. Success in college does not translate to the pros. 

4. Predicting which college quarterbacks will succeed in the NFL is nearly impossible due to the vast differences between college and pro football. There are no metrics that accurately predict a quarterback’s pro potential. 

5. Chase Daniel, Missouri’s star quarterback, excelled in a spread offense that utilized a simple, quick passing game with receivers spread across the field. However, his skills might not translate to the pro game, which requires reading complex defenses, making deep vertical throws, and handling heavy pass rushes. His backup, Chase Patton, was seen by some as having better pro potential, despite rarely playing in college.

6. Success in any highly specialized profession, like pro athlete or physician, is hard to predict because the skills required are so particular. Traditional metrics often fail to identify who will thrive in these roles. Aptitude and performance can only be truly measured on the job.

In summary, identifying excellence in specialized fields is challenging because success depends on complex, hard-to-measure skills that can only be demonstrated through real work. Traditional metrics frequently fail as predictors. The impacts of environmental factors like schools or classrooms are often outweighed by individual aptitude — for good or ill. Overall, excellence in some pursuits remains largely unpredictable.

  

The author argues that effective teaching requires more than just strong content knowledge or high cognitive skills. The author illustrates this point through examples of preschool and high school teachers who were effective due to skills unrelated to their knowledge or cognition.

The preschool teacher was able to effectively manage a group of lively and distracted three- and four-year-olds by allowing them flexibility and responding to them with sensitivity. The high school math teacher was able to teach a complex trigonometry lesson by moving around the room, checking in with each student, and offering help and encouragement. 

The author argues that these interpersonal skills, like flexibility, sensitivity, and the ability to connect with students, are more important for effective teaching than credentials or scores. The author challenges the notion that higher standards for teachers, like tougher academic requirements, will necessarily lead to better teaching. Effective teaching is complex, relying on a diverse set of skills.

The examples demonstrate how teachers can be effective when they have strong soft skills, like managing the classroom environment, motivating students, and providing feedback. The lesson is that teaching ability involves more than just cognitive abilities or knowledge. Interpersonal skills, personality, and instinct also play a large role. Teacher evaluations and policies should account for these soft skills, not just focus on teachers' test scores, degrees, or certifications.

In summary, the key takeaway is that effective teaching relies on a complex set of skills, many of which are unrelated to cognition or academic qualifications. Soft skills and interpersonal abilities are equally, if not more, important for teacher quality. Evaluating or improving teaching needs to account for these diverse skills. Raising the bar for teachers' academic qualifications will not necessarily translate to better teaching.

 

- An analyst at the Center for American Progress investigated whether teacher certifications or master's degrees help in the classroom. They found that neither makes a difference. Test scores, degrees, and certifications do not predict teacher success. 

- A researcher analyzed "desist" events where teachers have to stop misbehavior. How the teacher responds does not seem to matter. What matters more is whether the teacher can stop the chain reaction of misbehavior before it starts. The researcher called this ability "withitness." Great teachers seem to need withitness.

- The financial advising field shows what could happen in teaching. Firms interview many candidates to find a few good ones. They have a rigorous evaluation through a training process. Few candidates succeed. Similarly, the teaching field may need to lower standards to let more candidates in and then rigorously evaluate them to find the best. This could improve teaching but may be politically difficult.

- A scout evaluated a star college quarterback, Chase Daniel, during one game. Daniel usually does not make risky throws, but he made one interception. The scout said this single mistake was "just a little slice" and did not necessarily mean Daniel would be a bad pro quarterback. More evidence would be needed to make a prediction.

- In the 1940s and 1950s, the "Mad Bomber" terrorized New York City by placing pipe bombs and leaving threatening letters signed "F.P."

 

- In 1956, NYPD Inspector Howard Finney sought the help of psychiatrist James Brussel to catch the "Mad Bomber" who had been terrorizing the city for 16 years.

- Brussel analyzed the bomber's letters and predicted he would be a middle-aged, unmarried Slavic man who was impeccably neat. When caught, Brussel predicted the man would be wearing a double-breasted suit - and he was right. The bomber was George Metesky.

- John Douglas, an FBI profiler, tried to catch the "BTK" serial killer who was terrorizing Wichita in the 1970s and '80s. Douglas and two colleagues tried to build a profile of the killer to help police.

- Unlike in a typical whodunit detective story where there are many suspects, in profiling the net of suspects is narrowed based on analysis of the crimes. Profilers "deduce what kind of man he might be" based on his deeds. 

- Douglas and the profilers don't catch the criminal themselves. They provide predictions and analysis to help local police. Douglas didn't always write down or justify his predictions.

- Once, Douglas went to a police station and profiled that a brutal assault and murder of an elderly woman was likely committed by a disheveled 16- or 17-year old loner with anger issues. Douglas said he would make an easier living as a psychic, but he was not - his job was criminal profiling.

- The key ideas are that criminal profilers narrow the field of suspects and provide predictions to police based on deducing the perpetrator's traits from the details and nature of the crimes. But they don't directly catch the criminal themselves.

 

- John Douglas and Robert Ressler were FBI agents who interviewed many serial killers to find patterns in their methods and personalities. 

- They proposed two main types of serial killers - “organized” killers who are intelligent, logical, and in control, and “disorganized” killers who are impulsive, random, and chaotic. They believed killers’ personalities matched their crime scenes. 

- Profiles based on this system seem useful, as in a case of a teacher murdered in the Bronx. The profile matched the disorganized killer Carmine Calabro, a disturbed man living in the building. 

- However, the usefulness of this profiling is limited. The police already suspected Calabro, and profilers often get details wrong, like the killer’s age. Specific details must match for a profile to be truly helpful.

- Analyses show FBI profiles only directly led to an arrest in about 3% of cases. Detectives struggle with conflicting profiles, unsure which details to believe. 

- The typology itself is flawed, as Douglas and Ressler only interviewed available serial killers, not a representative sample. Their conclusions are based on a small, biased sample and subjective judgments.

- In summary, FBI profiling is largely unscientific and of limited use to law enforcement. Specific profile details are often inaccurate, and the validity of the underlying organized/disorganized typology is questionable. Profiling should not be viewed as a reliable criminal identification method.

 

- The FBI proposed that serial killers could be categorized into organized or disorganized types based on crime scene characteristics. 
- Researchers tested this assumption and found little evidence to support the FBI’s distinction. Serial killer crimes are usually a mix of organized and disorganized traits.
- The researchers found no correspondence between the patterns in serial killer crimes and attributes of the criminals themselves. Different offenders can exhibit the same behaviors for different reasons.
- The persuasive power of FBI criminal profiles comes more from their ambiguous and contradictory language than from real insight into the minds of criminals. By using a variety of techniques like the “rainbow ruse,” “Barnum statements,” and the “vanishing negative,” profiles can seem uncannily accurate while saying very little. 
- The FBI profile of the Mad Bomber was not actually very accurate. The real breakthrough came from a clerk going through old personnel files, not from the FBI’s psychological analysis. 
- John Douglas’s profile of the BTK killer was speculative, assuming the killer was in his mid-30s to late 30s, reclusive but able to function socially, and insecure around women. But at the time, the killer’s identity and attributes were still unknown. Profiles run the risk of confirmation bias, ignoring information that does not fit the profile.

In summary, the evidence does not strongly support the ability of the FBI’s techniques to systematically profile serial killers. Their methods seem to rely more on ambiguity, contradiction, and retrofitting evidence to match profiles than on real psychological insight. More rigor and skepticism are needed.

 

- In the 1990s, McKinsey consultants studied top companies and concluded that success depends on attracting and promoting top "talent." They advocated hiring top performers, rewarding them disproportionately, and pushing them into leadership roles quickly. 
- Enron closely followed this "talent mindset." They hired hundreds of top MBAs each year and lavishly rewarded top performers. Enron executives said that talent was the only thing distinguishing Enron from competitors.
- However, Enron's talent focus may have contributed to its downfall. There are several issues with the "talent mindset":

1. The link between talent attributes like IQ and job performance is weak. Things like practical intelligence, emotional intelligence, and the ability to collaborate are also important. 

2. Ranking and promoting people primarily on talent can create internal competitiveness and conflict, undermining collaboration and organizational culture. 

3. An obsessive focus on talent can mean that managers spend little time developing the skills and providing the opportunities that would help employees thrive in leadership roles. Raw talent is not enough.

4. The talent mindset implies that those at the bottom of the rankings are expendable, even if they have important institutional knowledge and skills. This can damage motivation, trust, and performance across the organization.

In summary, while talent is important, an obsessive focus on attracting and rewarding top talent is misguided. Organizational success depends on developing talent at all levels, creating a supportive and collaborative culture, and recognizing the value of institutional knowledge and relationships, not just raw talent. The "talent mindset" advocated by McKinsey contributed to the dysfunctional culture and practices at Enron that ultimately led to its downfall.

 Here are the key points in the summary:

1) The author was transferred to take charge of an underperforming department. The goal is to quickly improve the department’s performance. The author evaluates some strategies to achieve this. 

2) There are challenges in accurately assessing workplace ability and performance. Judging ability based on a simple test can be misleading. Performance evaluation is difficult and subjective without clear criteria. At Enron, frequent reorganizations and job changes made performance evaluation almost impossible. Enron ended up promoting people based primarily on perceived “talent” rather than actual performance.

3) The “War for Talent” philosophy argues for indulging and rewarding perceived A players to keep them happy and engaged. Enron epitomized this, giving their stars free rein and reorganizing the company around whatever those stars found most exciting. 

4) The authors identify three types of flawed managers: High Likability Floaters, Hommes de Ressentiment, and Narcissists. Narcissists are confident and charismatic but terrible managers. They overestimate their own contributions to success, avoid responsibility for failure, and aggressively self-promote to fill leadership vacuums. Enron exhibited these narcissistic characteristics as a company.

5) The distinction between Greedy Corporations concerned only with short-term gain and Narcissistic Corporations like Enron that nurture cults of genius matters. How we view success and failure—as fixed traits or skills that can be developed—significantly impacts behavior and culture. Enron’s approach is an example of the dangers of promoting a fixed view of talent.

In summary, the key argument is that a talent mindset that rewards perceived genius over actual performance and does not hold people accountable for failures can foster a toxic corporate culture. The example of Enron illustrates how this approach is deeply flawed and destined to end badly.

 

1. Carol Dweck conducted a study at the University of Hong Kong, where classes are taught in English. She asked students to take an English proficiency test and then asked if they wanted to take a remedial English class. Only students with a growth mindset signed up for the class. Students with a fixed mindset were concerned about appearing deficient, so they did not take the class, even though it could help them. In another study, Dweck praised some students for their effort and others for their intelligence after a challenging test. Those praised for intelligence were reluctant to take on difficult tasks later and their performance declined.  Some even lied about their scores to seem smarter.  

2. McKinsey and Enron assumed that organizational intelligence depended on individuals, but companies succeed through systems and execution, not just individual brilliance. The Allies had talented leaders in WW2, but the US Navy struggled against German U-boats until they created an organization, the Tenth Fleet, to coordinate efforts. Organization and systems, not just talent, drove success.

3. Successful companies like Southwest Airlines, Walmart, and Procter & Gamble have built great organizations, not just recruited star talent. They have efficient systems and processes, not an “all-star team.”  Promoting from within and valuing culture fit over prestige has served them well.

4. Enron had an open market for hiring that encouraged poaching and valued talent over building a strong organization. But talent alone does not make a successful company without the organization and systems to support it.

In summary, Dweck’s research and examples from business show that a “talent mindset” focused too narrowly on individual ability is misguided. Success depends on building a strong organizational system and culture, not just recruiting star talent. A “growth mindset” focused on continuous learning and development is most conducive to success, for both individuals and organizations.

 

- Nolan Myers is a 22-year-old Harvard computer science graduate from Houston. He is described as likable, smart, and charismatic. 

- The author meets Myers briefly but comes away highly impressed with him and confident in his abilities and potential for success. However, the author acknowledges that this impression is based on very limited information.

- Executives at Tellme, a Silicon Valley startup, and Microsoft also form strong positive impressions of Myers from very brief interactions. Tellme executive Hadi Partovi and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer both badly want to hire Myers based mostly on gut instinct. 

- There is a disconnect between the limited information these individuals have about Myers and the strong conclusions they draw about him and his potential. However, in the new economy, hiring the right people is seen as crucial to a company's success. This emphasis on hiring for "cultural fit" and potential is used to justify relying heavily on first impressions and instinct.

- The summary suggests this approach is problematic and that employers may be drawing overly confident conclusions from very limited information. Strong first impressions are not necessarily indicative of someone's actual abilities or potential. But in the drive to hire perceived "top talent," companies eagerly make job offers based on these kinds of impressions.

The key theme is that there is an overreliance in hiring on first impressions and gut instinct, rather than a thorough evaluation of a candidate's actual qualifications and abilities. This flawed approach is rationalized by the importance placed on finding candidates who seem to be a "cultural fit." But fit and potential are hard to accurately assess from very limited interaction.

 

1. Job interviews are a very common way for companies to evaluate candidates for positions. However, interviewers often have to make judgments about a candidate based on a relatively brief interaction. Researchers have found that people can make snap judgments about others that are surprisingly accurate, even based on very little information. 

2. In one study, people viewing short video clips of teachers with the sound off were able to rate the teachers' effectiveness similarly to students who had spent an entire semester in the teachers' classes. A similar study found that people's ratings of job candidates based on brief handshake clips were very similar to the ratings of interviewers who had conducted 15-20 minute interviews. This suggests that people can make quick, intuitive judgments that provide real insight.

3. However, these snap judgments also have significant downsides and limitations. Initial impressions may color how we interpret all subsequent interactions, causing us to hear what we expect to hear. Judgments made in one context (e.g. over lunch) often do not generalize well to other contexts (e.g. playtime). While we may gain genuine insight from quick impressions, we have to be very cautious about overgeneralizing, as our expectations and biases can strongly impact how we see and evaluate others.

In summary, researchers have found evidence that humans have a capacity for making rapid, intuitive social judgments that can be quite accurate and insightful. However, these snap judgments also have substantial shortcomings and limitations, as they are subject to biases, do not always generalize well across situations, and may cause us to overinterpret interactions in line with our initial expectations. We must be wary of putting too much stock into quick first impressions.

 

- People's behavior varies greatly based on the situation and context. We tend to underestimate the influence of context and overestimate the consistency of people's character and behavior. 
- For example, studies of children at summer camps found little consistency in their behavior across different settings. But counselors' final impressions wrongly perceived the children's behavior as highly consistent. This is known as the Fundamental Attribution Error.
- Interviews are prone to this error and snap judgments. The interviewer assumes the interviewee's behavior in the interview reflects how they always are, but interviews provide limited, potentially misleading information. 
- Questions like "what's your greatest weakness?" merely test whether the interviewee knows the expected response. Structured interviews with rigorously scripted, unexpected questions are better at predicting job performance. But most interviewers prefer a more free-flowing, get-to-know-you style resembling dating.
- The profile subject, Nolan Myers, agonized over job offers and sought advice from mentors like Steve Ballmer. Ballmer suggested Myers pick the job that excited him most and was best for his career. Myers talked to his parents daily while deciding.

In summary, the key ideas are:

1) People's behavior depends greatly on the situation, but we tend to overlook this. 
2) Interviews are prone to bias and favor impressions of personality consistency over the influence of context.
3) Structured interviews with unscripted questions are better at predicting job performance but most interviewers prefer a looser, more romantic style.
4) The profile subject Myers carefully deliberated over career options with advice from mentors and family.

 

- In Canada, a pit bull attacked a 2.5-year-old boy named Jayden Clairoux and his parents when they were walking home. The attack led the Ontario government to ban the ownership of pit bulls, arguing that like great white sharks, pit bulls are too dangerous to be around people.

- While not all pit bulls are dangerous, the breed has been bred to be aggressive and prone to attack without warning. Pit bulls are frequently involved in attacks that seriously injure or kill people, which has led to restrictions or bans on the breed in many places.

- However, saying that pit bulls are dangerous is a generalization, and all generalizations involve leaving certain factors out. The choice of what factors to include in a generalization is complex with no easy answers. Generalizations are necessary to make predictions, but they can also lead to stereotyping.

- For example, after the London bombings in 2005, the NYPD announced it would conduct random searches in the subways to find terrorists. However, a columnist argued that officials actually know what Al Qaeda terrorists look like - young Arab or Pakistani men. But in reality, it is very difficult to know what any criminal group "looks like." Citing The Godfather as an example, mafia members can look like any ethnicity. The same is true of Islamic terrorists.

- In summary, while generalizations are necessary, they involve complex choices. And in many cases, the factors we leave out to make generalizations can be important, leading us to stereotype inaccurately. Strict policies based primarily on overgeneralizations, like breed-specific bans on dogs, require caution.

 

The passage discusses some issues with making generalizations and profiling. Some key points:

1) Racial profiling doesn't work because terrorists and criminals come from a variety of ethnic and demographic backgrounds. It is difficult to define and identify the categories you want to generalize about. 

2) Banning "pit bulls" is problematic because pit bulls aren't actually a single breed. There are several related breeds that get categorized as pit bulls. Banning anything "substantially similar" to a pit bull leads to a lot of ambiguity. In addition, pit bulls that pass temperament tests tend to be friendly toward people. Only pit bulls bred or trained to be aggressive are likely to be dangerous. 

3) New York City's declining crime rate is due to targeted policing efforts, not just broad social changes. The police department has focused resources on high-crime "hot spots" and has doubled police presence in some areas. This suggests that the level of policing can directly affect crime rates, not just bigger social factors.

4) Generalizations can be unstable for many reasons. What is true at one point in time may not be true later. For example, New York City was once crime-ridden but now has a very low crime rate. Kenya has been dominant in distance running for decades, so we expect them to stay that way, but if something changed drastically, that could end. 

5) There are too many traits that could potentially be used in profiling, so it is difficult to determine useful generalizations. For any given profile, there are many exceptions. The traits used can often be quite ambiguous.

So in summary, the passage outlines several significant issues with making broad generalizations and using profiling, especially in law enforcement. Generalizations can be problematic when categories are hard to define, traits are unstable or ambiguous, there are too many exceptions, and causes are complex.

 Here is a summary of the suspicious traits:

- Traveled with heavy luggage (two suitcases)
- Carried four pieces of luggage
- Overly protective of luggage
- Disassociated self from luggage 
- Traveled alone
- Traveled with a companion
- Acted too nervous
- Acted too calm
- Made eye contact with officer
- Avoided making eye contact with officer
- Wore expensive clothing and jewelry
- Dressed casually
- Went to restroom after deplaning
- Walked rapidly through airport
- Walked slowly through airport
- Walked aimlessly through airport
- Left airport by taxi
- Left airport by limousine
- Left airport by private car
- Left airport by hotel courtesy van

The list suggests the traits are unstable generalizations since smugglers can easily switch behaviors. Successful smugglers would not consistently display the same suspicious traits. The author argues that these unstable generalizations lead to poor decision making by officers. 

The author discusses how Commissioner Kelly reformed customs officers' criteria for stopping smugglers. Kelly reduced the number of traits from 43 to 6 broad ones:

1. Suspicious appearance 
2. Nervousness
3. Specific intelligence 
4. Dog alarm
5. Issue with paperwork or explanations
6. Contraband found implicating the person

The author argues these traits are more stable and led to improved, more effective decision making with a 25% increase in successful seizures despite a 75% drop in searches.

The author then discusses whether the notion of vicious pit bulls is a stable or unstable generalization. The author notes that while pit bulls have been involved in many fatal attacks, the breeds involved vary significantly from year to year, suggesting it is an unstable generalization. The author argues that more stable generalizations for vicious dogs would consider factors like:

- Gender (males more likely to bite)
- Intact versus neutered  (intact more likely to bite) 
- Chained versus unchained (chained more likely to bite)
- Dog's hunger/need for medical care
- History of aggression
- Vulnerable victims (like small children) who may provoke the dog
- Owners involved in dog fighting 

The author provides a case study of a pit bull attack in which all these factors were present, arguing that "fatal dog attacks are usually a perfect storm of bad human-canine interactions." The unstable generalization of blaming vicious breeds is an oversimplification. More stable factors like owner and environment are bigger influences on a dog's aggression.

In summary, the author argues law enforcement and those assessing dangerous dogs should rely on stable rather than unstable generalizations, focusing on factors like owner, environment, training, victim vulnerability, etc. rather than making assumptions based on breed alone. Broad generalizations based on unstable traits can lead to poor decision making. More nuanced analysis of stable factors is required.

 

- Shridev Café owned two aggressive dogs, Agua and Cafe, that attacked and killed a small child. 
- Café did not have the dogs neutered, even after they were confiscated temporarily after the first attack. Neutering cost $100, which Café thought was too expensive.
- On the day of the second attack, visitors riled up the dogs. The dogs then jumped the fence and attacked Jayden Clairoux, shaking him by the head. 
- This attack could have been prevented if the city had properly followed up after the first attack by neutering the dogs, ensuring Café took proper precautions, and enforcing laws to take dogs from irresponsible owners. 
- However, it was easier for the city to blame the breed of dog rather than take these necessary actions. A more nuanced approach was required to prevent this tragedy.
