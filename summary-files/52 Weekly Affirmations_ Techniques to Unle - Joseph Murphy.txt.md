Here is a summary of the key messages from the introduction:

- The conscious and subconscious minds work together to determine the course of your life. Your conscious mind generates thoughts, which become imprinted in your subconscious mind. Your subconscious mind then achieves these thoughts in reality.

- Negative and weak thoughts lead to failure and unhappiness. Positive and constructive reviews lead to success, prosperity, and happiness. Whatever ideas you habitually think will become your reality.

- Once your subconscious mind accepts an idea, it works to execute it. It does not judge; it simply takes and achieves whatever thoughts you provide. You attract what you mentally and emotionally envision.

- Affirmations are thoughts you consciously plant in your subconscious mind. They are assertions that something is true or exists. Affirmations are like seeds that you sow in your mind's garden. Whatever you plant will grow—plant positive thoughts to achieve positive outcomes.

- This practice works for people of all faiths or no faith. While some examples refer to God or divine Power, the core message is that Power within you creates according to your thoughts. You can harness this Power through your thoughts and imagination.

- To change your reality, change your thoughts. Control your thoughts, and you will control the Power within you that manifests those thoughts. With disciplined thinking, you can solve any problem or overcome any difficulty. By cooperating with the Power in and around you, you become the master of your destiny.

The summary highlights how your thoughts shape your life by imprinting on your subconscious mind, achieving these thoughts in reality. By planting positive reviews through affirmations, you harness your mind's Power to create your desired life. The practice is based on universal principles that work for people of all faiths. The key is learning to control your thoughts constructively.

Here are the key points:

• The Power of your subconscious mind is based on belief. Belief is simply the thought you hold in your mind.

• Your experiences, conditions, and circumstances result from the beliefs held in your subconscious mind. To change your experiences, you must change your thoughts.

• There are four ways to build belief: through experience, reason, faith, and affirmations or suggestions. Claims can be particularly effective in impressing your subconscious mind.

• Effective affirmations acknowledge universal truths, such as the truth of health, abundance, or peace. Their Power comes from aligning your mind with these truths, not words.

• To strengthen the impact of affirmations:

› Place them where you will see them frequently throughout the day.
› Relax and quiet your mind before reciting them.
› Recite them aloud if possible and visualize what they mean.
› Focus only on the positive, not the negative you want to eliminate.
› Use your imagination, not willpower. Picture the result you desire.
› Do not worry about the details; focus on the outcome. Get the feeling of already having succeeded.

• The subconscious mind is impersonal and works similarly for people of all faiths, beliefs, and religions. Substitute any word for "God" that reflects your personal opinion.

• Answered prayer is realizing your heart's desire, resulting from belief and mental acceptance, not from any particular religious religion or affiliation. Buddhists, Christians, Muslims, and others can all achieve their desires through faith.

• To improve health or circumstances, stop focusing on or discussing the problem. Affirm the desired solution and outcome, and your subconscious mind will work to achieve it.

That covers the essence and critical techniques presented in the summary. The Power of belief and the subconscious mind, built and harnessed through affirmations, can be used by anyone to improve their lives.

The key to manifesting your desire to feel and visualize them as already achieved in the present moment. Do not think of them as something that may happen in the future. Spend a week focusing on an affirmation related to your goal, repeating it daily with conviction and feeling. This helps impress your subconscious mind to align your thoughts and actions to achieve your desire.

Some tips for effective affirmations:

•Choose between focusing on health, finances or employment. Visualize how you will feel when the problem is resolved. Your feeling is critical.

•Affirm your goal in the present tense, not the future. Feel it as already achieved.

•Repeat the affirmation daily for a week. Merely reading them has little effect. Repetition is key.

•Rest in the conviction that it is already done. Do not say "I wish" or "I hope." State it as fact.

•Do not utter phrases like "I can't afford it" or "I can't do it". Your subconscious will make those prophecies come true.

•Relax and let your subconscious mind accept the new idea. Relaxation helps make the imprint.

•The weekly affirmations provided are examples. Choose affirmations that resonate with you.

•Examples include: cleansing your mind; affirming the Power of your subconscious; assigning your conscious mind the gatekeeper role; embracing truth; identifying your life's purpose; receiving the perfect plan; living harmoniously; sleeping in peace; making happiness a habit; claiming a better future.

The author genuinely believes in the Power of the mind and spiritual connection to positively influence one's experiences in life, including while traveling. By focusing on God's presence and messages of "love, peace, light, and beauty," the author can find and spread more of the same.

- Fatima's story centered around the Virgin Mary's reported appearances to three children - Lucia, Francisco, and Jacinta - in Portugal in 1917.

- According to the story, the Virgin Mary appeared to the children on the 13th of each month and told them prophecies and messages. Only the children could see and hear the Virgin Mary.

- On the final appearance, the Virgin Mary allegedly predicted the end of World War 1 and performed miracles like the dancing sun witnessed by thousands of people.

- The guide cited the healing of a paralyzed woman as evidence of the Power of faith and belief. The woman believed she would be healed if she prayed at the site of the apparitions, and she was healed, showing the Power of view and the mind.

- The guide distinguishes between spiritual healing and faith healing. Spiritual healing involves understanding the powers of the mind, while faith healing is based just on belief. The healing of the paralyzed woman was due to her belief and expectancy, which unlocked the Power of her subconscious mind.

- The Virgin Mary is a symbolic figure representing spiritual qualities like love, beauty, and order. Her appearances at Fatima and Lourdes were likely subjective creations of the visionaries' minds, not natural. The prophecies and messages also came from the children's subconscious minds.

- The author cites other examples of the Power of the mind, including a woman in Paris who went blind due to negative feelings toward her employers but regained her sight once she left the job and forgave them. Another woman had a dream warning her to postpone a trip and avoid a plane crash. The mind has the Power to heal, warn of danger, and shape our reality.

- In summary, the story highlights the Power of belief and the subconscious mind to heal, guide, and shape our lives miraculously. Though the Virgin Mary's appearances were likely, not accurate, the miracles and events surrounding them point to the extraordinary abilities of the human mind.

- St. Kevin, an Irish saint known for miracles, healed a man's eye, and people's wishes are said to be granted by climbing into St. Kevin's bed or sitting in his chair. A woman's cancer was healed after praying in bed. Impressions of St. Kevin's fingers in a rock are said to grant wishes when people place their hands in the impressions. An arthritic man's hands were healed this way.

- These healings are explained by the universal mind or subconscious, which we can all access, containing all knowledge and life experiences. People can tap into healing vibrations and wisdom by focusing attention on the universal mind through faith and expectancy. Devotion and impressing the subconscious lead to demonstrations and "miracles."
