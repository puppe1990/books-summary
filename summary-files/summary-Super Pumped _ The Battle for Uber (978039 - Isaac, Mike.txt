 Here's a summary:

- Uber planned to launch in Portland in 2014 despite not having the city's approval. 
- Portland transportation officials were tasked with stopping Uber drivers. 
- Uber's initial approach to get city approval didn't work. They tried to reason with city officials but were told to leave.
- Travis Kalanick, Uber's CEO, was impatient and wanted to launch in the city regardless of regulations. 
- Kalanick was known for his habit of pacing due to excess energy and impatience. 
- Uber's approach to expansion was launching in cities quickly, attracting many drivers and riders before local governments could react. 
- Portland wanted to regulate ride-sharing but needed more time. Uber wasn't willing to wait.

 

- Uber's headquarters in San Francisco was designed for Travis Kalanick's energetic management style, including a circular indoor track for "walk and talks." 

- In December 2014, Uber launched in Portland, Oregon without the city's consent, ignoring regulations. Uber's spokeswoman argued that regulations often couldn't keep up with innovation.

- The issue was UberX, Uber's low-cost service allowing almost anyone with a car to drive for Uber after a basic background check. This raised many legal issues that Uber ignored.

- Kalanick believed politicians would always protect established industries like taxis. He thought the public would support Uber even if it broke the rules. 

- To launch in Portland, Uber hired local managers to recruit many drivers by advertising large sign-up bonuses and cash payments for milestones. The managers often lacked experience but were ambitious and willing to evade rules.

- Portland officials tried to catch Uber drivers to fine and threaten them. But Uber had a sophisticated system to identify officials, monitor them, and block them from ordering Ubers by using a code called "Greyball." Officers could not prove Uber was operating.

- Uber had hired former CIA, NSA and FBI employees who spied on and tracked government officials. Greyball tagged officials as threats and showed them fake information in the Uber app.

- For 3 years, Uber operated illegally in Portland without consequences. By 2017, Uber was legal and popular there.

- Kalanick and others saw their tactics as defending drivers and fighting a corrupt taxi industry and outdated rules. They thought people would eventually understand Uber's way was right.

- Uber now operates worldwide but nearly failed in 2017 due to Kalanick's behavior and decline. His story is a cautionary tale of startup excess and hubris. 

- Uber's story shows how technology can disrupt labor, cities and industries; the problems of the tech industry's gender imbalance and belief in meritocracy; issues with startup funding and governance; debates over user data use; and the dangers of worshipping startup founders.

- Kalanick and executives created a toxic culture like Hobbes, Animal House and Wolf of Wall Street. Unlimited funding and no oversight led to spying, conflict, and fighting for power.

 Here's a summary:

- Travis Kalanick, Uber's CEO, frequently organized lavish company retreats to celebrate achieving major growth targets and revenue milestones. 

- In October 2015, Uber held a massive retreat in Las Vegas to celebrate reaching $10 billion in revenue. They called it "X to the X" to signify 10 to the power of 10.

- Uber went all out for the Vegas retreat, renting hundreds of hotel rooms for employees, giving them prepaid credit cards to spend freely, and throwing extravagant parties with free food and open bars. Employees were given temporary tattoos and an app with the schedule of events.

- Some executives worried the over-the-top celebration might reflect poorly on Uber's culture, which was already seen as arrogant. They warned employees not to identify themselves as Uber staff or talk to the press. 

- Some employees behaved badly at the retreat, hiring prostitutes, doing drugs, groping coworkers, and stealing a shuttle. Several were fired as a result.

- The lavish parties and irresponsible behavior highlighted some of the problems with Uber's reckless company culture at the time. Travis Kalanick's leadership and emphasis on rapid growth and success at all costs fueled this culture.

 

Travis Kalanick, the CEO of Uber, organized an extravagant multi-million dollar company retreat in Las Vegas to celebrate Uber reaching 10 billion trips. The highlight of the retreat was a surprise private concert by Beyoncé. To get Beyoncé to perform, Kalanick gave her $6 million in Uber stock. 

The retreat embodied the exuberance of Silicon Valley at the time. Young tech companies were becoming hugely valuable overnight, making employees very wealthy. In response, the employees lived lavish lifestyles and dreamed of creating their own successful tech startups. 

However, there were downsides to the rapid growth of tech. Housing costs skyrocketed, inequality increased, and “gig economy” jobs proliferated. Venture capitalists eagerly funded tech startups in hopes of finding the next Facebook or Google, giving tech founders more leverage and less oversight. Some founders developed a sense of entitlement as they were lavished with praise and perks.

At the retreat, Kalanick gave a 3-hour presentation explaining his vision for Uber’s future growth. He idolized Jeff Bezos and Amazon, and wanted Uber to become a logistics company that delivered people, packages, food, and more. To shape Uber’s culture, Kalanick introduced 14 company values that he wrote himself, inspired by Amazon’s leadership principles. The values embodied an aggressive, competitive mindset focused on rapid growth.

In summary, the Las Vegas retreat demonstrated the excitement and wealth of the tech boom, but also hinted at issues that would later emerge. Kalanick’s vision and company values revealed ideals that helped Uber’s early success but would eventually contribute to its troubles.

 

- Travis Kalanick grew up in Northridge, California, a suburb of Los Angeles, in a middle-class family. 
- His parents were Donald, a civil engineer, and Bonnie, an advertising sales executive for the local newspaper.
- Bonnie doted on Travis and was very proud of his later success. She passed on to him her charisma, competitiveness, and determination.
- Travis was close with his mother. Even after leaving home, he continued to return for holidays and Bonnie continued to support him through early failures in his career. 
- Friends and family described Travis as stubborn and relentless like his mother. Despite facing rejection and failure, he never gave up. 
- Donald, as a civil engineer, was more logically and practically minded. He worked for the city of Los Angeles for much of his career.

 

Donald Kalanick, Travis Kalanick’s father, was an engineer 
who married twice and had two daughters from his first 
marriage. Donald and Travis bonded over working on science 
projects together. Donald introduced Travis to computers at an
early age, and Travis learned to code in middle school.

Travis Kalanick exhibited a precocious intelligence and a 
competitive drive from an early age. He was adept at math and 
sales. However, he struggled with bullying in middle school until
he learned to fight back and fit in with the popular crowd. As a 
teenager, Kalanick sold Cutco knives door-to-door and started
his own SAT tutoring business.

Kalanick attended UCLA, where he studied computer science 
and economics. There, he and his friends took advantage of the
fast internet speeds available on campus to download files and
play multiplayer games. They came up with the idea to build a
central hub where people could search for and download media
files. This led to Kalanick co-founding Scour, a file-sharing
network and search engine.

Kalanick dropped out of UCLA during his senior year to work
on Scour full-time. He was completely devoted to growing the
company, often to the detriment of his personal relationships and
responsibilities. Scour became popular on college campuses,
competing with Napster, though its business model was
unsustainable.

 

- Travis Kalanick founded Scour, a file-sharing company, in the late 1990s. 
- Scour gained popularity and attention from investors Ron Burkle and Michael Ovitz. 
- Ovitz sued Scour for breaking a “no-shop” clause after Kalanick told him they needed to find other funding sources. Ovitz then sold his stake, betraying the founders.
- The RIAA sued Scour for $250 billion, forcing it into bankruptcy. Kalanick was devastated after working hard to build the company. 
- During this time, the dot-com bubble was growing in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Many internet companies were overvalued and relying on cheap capital and artificial revenues. 
- The Federal Reserve raised interest rates, bursting the bubble. Hundreds of companies went out of business, unable to find funding. Empty offices and abandoned companies were common sights.
- Kalanick learned from this experience and vowed never to be taken advantage of by an investor again.

 

Ten months before the financial crisis of 2007, Travis Kalanick sold his startup Red Swoosh for nearly $20 million. After six years of struggling to keep Red Swoosh afloat, Kalanick finally caught some lucky breaks. He received investments from billionaire Mark Cuban and a venture capital firm. He also negotiated a deal to sell Red Swoosh to its competitor Akamai Technologies. 

From this experience, Kalanick learned some valuable lessons. He developed a siege mentality, seeing threats and enemies everywhere. He also adopted a Darwinian view of what it takes for a CEO to survive. Most importantly, he learned to never trust venture capitalists, believing that it is in their nature to replace founding CEOs.

With money from the sale of Red Swoosh, Kalanick began to enjoy the luxuries of San Francisco. He partied, relaxed, and pondered his next move. Little did he know, a national crisis was unfolding.

For years, banks had been giving risky home loans to subprime borrowers and then selling those loans to investors. When subprime borrowers started defaulting on their adjustable-rate mortgages, it created a ripple effect through the economy, ultimately leading to the financial crisis of 2007. The country would take years to recover.

So in summary, ten months before the financial crisis, Travis Kalanick sold Red Swoosh, gained valuable experience, became distrustful of venture capitalists, and began enjoying the San Francisco lifestyle. Meanwhile, risky practices in the housing market were setting the stage for an economic collapse.

 

- The global financial crisis of 2008 led governments to take drastic measures to save the economy. The U.S. government bailed out major banks and lowered interest rates. 

- While the government focused on Wall Street, tech companies in Silicon Valley were largely unaffected. The dot-com bust of the early 2000s had strengthened tech companies by weeding out weaker companies. Companies like Google and Facebook emerged as leaders.

- Three factors fueled the rise of Silicon Valley companies after 2008: 1) widespread broadband internet allowed more people to use internet services; 2) Amazon Web Services made it easy and cheap for startups to build companies without infrastructure costs; 3) the iPhone, released in 2007, introduced a new way of mobile computing and the App Store allowed third-party developers to build apps for the iPhone.

- Steve Jobs showed the first iPhone to John Doerr, a venture capitalist, in 2006. Doerr saw the potential for startups to build apps for the iPhone and wanted to start a fund to invest in iPhone app startups. But Jobs didn’t want outsiders making “shitty apps” for the iPhone. 

- However, Jobs eventually allowed third-party apps in the App Store, which fueled the success and popularity of the iPhone beyond what even Jobs anticipated. The iPhone reinvented the smartphone with its sleek design and multitude of apps. It combined many devices—phone, MP3 player, camera, mobile web browser—into one.

- In summary, government intervention saved major companies during the financial crisis but largely ignored tech companies, which were thriving. The iPhone turbocharged this growth by giving developers and startups an open platform to build on. This perfect storm of events led to rapid innovation in Silicon Valley in the late 2000s.

 Here's a summary:

- John Doerr, a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins, received a call from Steve Jobs in 2008 proposing that Kleiner start a fund to invest in iPhone apps. Doerr agreed and raised $100 million.  
- The App Store allowed anyone to develop and distribute apps, creating many new opportunities. Top developers were making thousands of dollars a day. Venture capital firms started investing heavily in apps.  
- Garrett Camp, a Canadian entrepreneur, moved to San Francisco and co-founded StumbleUpon, a web discovery tool. In 2008, he sold StumbleUpon to eBay for $75 million but was frustrated with the city's taxi system. 
- Camp was smart but lacked the polish of someone like Elon Musk. He enjoyed an affluent lifestyle in San Francisco but still couldn't get a taxi. The taxi system was outdated, with an old fleet and inefficient dispatching. 
- Though Camp made money from the StumbleUpon sale, he remained stubborn and unwilling to change his mind. While persistence is useful for startups, it becomes a problem if the idea isn't working.

 Here is a summary of the passage:

- Garrett Camp, a successful entrepreneur, had trouble getting taxis in San Francisco. He tried various workarounds like calling multiple cab companies at once or using expensive car services, but nothing was very reliable or convenient. 
- While watching a James Bond movie, Camp noticed Bond using a GPS map on his cell phone. This gave Camp the idea for an app that could match people requesting rides with available drivers. He thought this could make getting around the city much easier.
- Travis Kalanick, another entrepreneur, had recently sold his company and was looking for new opportunities. He promoted himself as an “angel investor” who could help advise startup founders. Kalanick was frustrated with how venture capitalists seemed focused mostly on profits rather than changing the world.  
- To connect with other entrepreneurs, Kalanick hosted informal events at his apartment which he called the “JamPad.” The JamPad allowed people to get together, share ideas, and talk about new technologies over food and drinks. Kalanick wanted to create a place where people could work to improve the world through innovation.

The key point is that observing Bond using a GPS map on his phone inspired Camp to conceive of a ride-sharing app, an idea that would eventually lead to Uber. At around the same time, Kalanick was looking to get involved with a new startup and provide guidance to young entrepreneurs. Though their paths had not yet crossed, Camp and Kalanick were both in a position to create something new and revolutionary.

 

- Building a startup is extremely challenging and requires wearing many hats. Neither Garrett Camp nor Travis Kalanick wanted to take on the difficult role of founder for their on-demand luxury car service idea.

- So in January 2010, Kalanick tweeted asking for tips on finding an “entrepreneurial product mgr/biz-dev killer” for their “location based service.” Twenty-six-year-old Ryan Graves responded, and Kalanick hired him. 

- Graves was an aimless twentysomething trying to break into tech. He grew up surfing in San Diego and went to college in Ohio. Friends described him as likable, with a high emotional intelligence. He idolized famous entrepreneurs.

- Graves was bored with his job as a database admin in Chicago. He unsuccessfully applied to work at Foursquare. So he started doing work for them for free in his spare time to gain experience. His hustle and talent impressed Foursquare, and they hired him as an intern.

- A year later, Kalanick’s tweet led Graves to join Uber. Graves’s enthusiasm, work ethic, and ability to get along with people helped propel Uber’s early growth. Kalanick appreciated Graves’s skills and passion, though Kalanick remained firmly in control of decision making.

- Graves’s friendly persona contrasted with Kalanick’s hard-charging style. But together, their skills and partnership helped transform Uber from an idea into a fast-growing global company. Graves’s decision to reply to Kalanick’s tweet ended up making him a billionaire.

 

Ryan Graves was an ambitious young intern at Foursquare who wanted to work at a startup. He saw a tweet from Travis Kalanick, the co-founder of Uber, looking to hire someone. Graves responded and was hired as Uber’s first employee. 

Graves was named CEO, but struggled in the role. Investors were hesitant to invest in the company with him as CEO. Travis Kalanick took over as CEO and Graves became VP of operations.

Uber started as a service where people requested rides on a website and were picked up in luxury black cars. Uber’s co-founder Garrett Camp focused on branding and maintaining a high-end image. Ryan Graves and other employees recruited limo drivers to work for Uber. They gave away free iPhones to drivers to get them using Uber’s service.

Uber grew quickly through word-of-mouth and positive press in San Francisco. People appreciated the convenience and service. Kalanick and Camp focused on providing a good user experience.

In summary, Ryan Graves became Uber’s first employee and CEO but struggled in the role. Travis Kalanick took over as CEO and helped the company grow quickly. Uber started as a luxury black car service and grew through marketing, word-of-mouth, and a focus on user experience.

 

Uber aimed to provide a seamless experience for riders from requesting a ride to exiting the vehicle. Travis Kalanick, Uber's CEO, wanted the experience to be “frictionless.” Riders could track their driver's arrival on a map and pay via a credit card on file so there was no need to tip or deal with cash. The sleek black cars and professional drivers provided a high-end experience compared to traditional taxis. 

To scale, Uber needed to expand beyond San Francisco. Austin Geidt, a 24-year-old with no relevant experience, was tasked with launching Uber in new cities. She would convince local limo companies to partner with Uber, promising more business during their downtime. Uber subsidized rides to attract new riders and drivers. As demand grew, companies hired more drivers. Geidt created a playbook for launching in new cities that she used to expand Uber across the U.S. and the world.

Just after Geidt helped scale Uber beyond San Francisco, the company received a cease and desist order for operating illegally without proper permits. While others worried, Kalanick insisted they “ignore it,” drop “Cab” from the name, and continue operating. 

Bill Gurley, a venture capitalist, saw Uber’s huge potential and wanted to invest. Unlike the founders, he was focused on the opportunity to disrupt the massive taxi industry. Gurley believed that with its growth, Uber could become a multi-billion dollar company by moving transportation into the digital world. Riders gained freedom and drivers avoided expensive equipment by using the Uber app. Gurley sought to invest to gain a stake in this promising new company built out of nothing.

 Here's a summary:

- Bill Gurley was interested in "marketplaces" - businesses that matched buyers and sellers. Many of his investments at Benchmark capital were in companies like this. 

- Gurley wanted to find his own hugely successful investment. He saw that opportunity in Uber.

- Gurley grew up in Texas. His parents were hardworking and community-minded. Gurley got into computers at a young age and studied computer engineering and business in college.

- Gurley started his career in tech, working for Compaq and AMD. But he was more interested in venture capital and emerging technologies. After being rejected by VCs in Austin, he got a job as a tech analyst on Wall Street.

- Gurley quickly became a star analyst, gaining experience and mentors. He got the opportunity to attend elite tech conferences and gained attention for his accurate predictions and analysis of tech companies. 

- Gurley's analysis and insight, along with his mentor Frank Quattrone, led companies like Amazon to choose their firm, Deutsche Bank, for IPOs over bigger name banks. Gurley saw Amazon's potential early on.

- Gurley's greatest talent was his willingness to make bold predictions about the potential of new technologies and companies. This would serve him well as a venture capitalist.

 Here's a summary:

- Bill Gurley is an awkward but brilliant venture capitalist. He is 6 feet 9 inches tall but tries not to flaunt his height. 
- Gurley began his career as a tech analyst, gaining notoriety for downgrading Netscape's stock rating when other analysts were bullish. This call proved prescient when Netscape's stock plunged.
- Gurley joined the venture capital firm Benchmark Capital in 1999 as their sixth partner. The partners were all exceptionally tall, like a basketball team. 
- Gurley is an optimist about technology's potential for positive impact. He invested during down economic times, believing downturns reveal the best entrepreneurs.

- Venture capital is a challenging job. VCs spend their time evaluating startups, meeting with founders, bankers, CEOs, and journalists. They have to choose the best startups to invest in to get good returns for their investors. 
- About a third of VC investments fail. To offset risk, VCs invest in many startups across sectors. "Moonshot" startups that can dominate industries offer the biggest potential returns.
- VCs provide money to startups in exchange for equity. Startups go through funding rounds, from seed funding to Series A, B, and beyond. Rounds provide more money as the startup grows. The goal is an acquisition or IPO. 
- Investing early in a startup's life is most prestigious for a VC. They get more equity for less money, and look prescient if the startup succeeds. 
- The hardest part of a VC's job is finding the right founder to lead a startup. Founders who can "conjure" a company out of nothing are the most vaunted in Silicon Valley.

 

- The founder of a startup works extremely hard and sacrifices a lot to build the company. They see themselves as visionaries changing the world.

- Silicon Valley celebrates founder culture and worships successful founders. In the 2010s, founders gained increasing control and influence over their companies. 

- Google's co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin pioneered the dual-class stock structure, which gave them majority voting control while still going public. Many tech companies adopted this structure, allowing founders to maintain control after IPO.

- Venture capitalists competed intensely to invest in hot startups. Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital wanted to invest in Uber and impressed Travis Kalanick. Kalanick wanted a prestigious investor like Benchmark and Gurley on Uber's board.

- Gurley was famous for his blog "Above the Crowd." He spent a long time crafting each post. The blog and Gurley's experience made him an influential voice in tech investing.

- Kalanick was rejected by other top VC firms like Sequoia Capital before Benchmark invested. Benchmark's investment in Uber's Series A round helped Uber grow quickly.

 Here's a summary:

- Travis Kalanick designed Uber to be ruthless and combative. He saw the company as being in an "existential battle" with entrenched transportation interests and regulators.

- Kalanick gave local city managers a lot of autonomy and power. They were responsible for growing ridership in their cities. Some abused this power, leading to issues with Uber's corporate culture. But generally, this autonomy made employees idolize Kalanick's leadership.

- Kalanick envisioned Uber as a place that fostered entrepreneurship. He wanted employees to learn how to found and build companies, then go on to start their own companies after leaving Uber. 

- Kalanick employed guerrilla tactics to quickly gain critical mass in new cities before regulators could stop them. Once Uber became popular, cities found it hard to shut them down. Kalanick believed this was necessary to overcome "corruption and cronyism" in the taxi industry.

- Benchmark invested $11 million in Uber in 2011. Bill Gurley joined Uber's board, which at the time had only 3 members: Garrett Camp, Ryan Graves, and Travis Kalanick.

 

Travis Kalanick was fiercely competitive and sought to dominate the ride-sharing market. He saw Lyft, Uber’s main competitor, as an existential threat that needed to be crushed. Kalanick employed underhanded tactics to undermine Lyft at every turn. This included:

-Lobbying regulators to crack down on Lyft even though Uber was also breaking the rules. Kalanick complained that Lyft was acting illegally while engaging in similar behavior himself.

-Personally trolling and provoking Lyft’s co-founder, John Zimmer, on Twitter. Kalanick would question Lyft’s business practices and policies in an attempt to get under Zimmer’s skin.  

-Threatening Lyft’s potential investors and warning them not to invest in Lyft. Kalanick made it clear that investors could only back one company, Uber or Lyft, but not both. This tactic caused many investors to back out of funding rounds with Lyft.

-Crashing Lyft’s driver recruitment events by sending Uber employees to poach Lyft’s potential drivers. The Uber employees would show up in all black, offer Uber-branded cookies and give out referral codes to lure drivers away from Lyft.

Kalanick was obsessed with winning at all costs. He believed the ride-sharing market was a zero-sum game and that there was only room for one dominant player. Kalanick was determined to make sure that player was Uber, even if it meant engaging in unethical behavior to hamper the competition. His desire to win was absolute.

 Here's a summary:

- Bill Gurley, an early Uber investor, connected Travis Kalanick with Emil Michael to help Uber raise money. 
- Emil Michael was a talented dealmaker who had worked at Tellme Networks and Klout. He had experience striking partnerships with big companies. 
- Gurley thought Michael could be a moderating influence on Kalanick and help make deals for Uber. 
- Michael was charming and affable. He was good at adapting to different situations and people. However, he also tended to enable bad behavior in order to fit in. 
- Kalanick and Michael immediately hit it off. Michael became Kalanick's second-in-command as Chief Business Officer. But in reality, he became Kalanick's dealmaker and best friend. 
- Kalanick and Michael spent a huge amount of time together, both professionally and personally. They took trips together and lived an lavish lifestyle. The lines between their personal and professional relationships blurred.

 

Travis Kalanick and Emil Michael were extremely effective at raising money for Uber. They developed an innovative fundraising approach called the “Homeshow” where they forced interested investors to come to them in San Francisco. They created scarcity and competition by only holding three meetings per day. 

Kalanick was an expert at pitching Uber. He modeled himself after Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg. He highlighted Uber’s enormous growth potential and “negative churn,” showing how customers became lifelong users after just a few rides.

Kalanick and Michael were also lucky in their timing. There was a lot of interest in tech investing and a “fear of missing out.” Investors desperately wanted a stake in Uber, the hottest startup. 

Kalanick took full advantage of investors’ demand. He offered them bad terms, stripping many of information rights. He also maintained full control through special supervoting shares for himself and co-founders. Uber was Kalanick’s company.

The investment firm Google Ventures worked hard to invest in Uber’s Series C round. But Kalanick demanded difficult terms, requiring a $250 million check and a $3.5 billion valuation. Despite the unusually large amount, Google Ventures agreed in hopes of accessing such a hot company. But like other investors, they were largely shut out from information and control.

In summary, Kalanick and Michael were masters at extracting money from eager investors on terms very favorable to themselves. They maintained tight control over Uber even as they took investors' funds.

 Here's a summary:

- Travis Kalanick was thrilled to get an investment from Google Ventures in 2013 and demanded a meeting with Google co-founder Larry Page as part of the deal. 
- Bill Krane, a partner at Google Ventures, arranged the meeting and surprised Kalanick by sending a self-driving Lexus to pick him up. 
- Kalanick was excited to meet his "big brother," Larry Page, whom he admired. However, Page was not actually very personable and was more interested in Uber for strategic reasons, including his interest in transportation and automation. 
- Kalanick believed the meeting went well and that they discussed potential partnerships, though Page left early. Kalanick looked forward to future meetings.
- Meanwhile, Anthony Levandowski, an engineer who had worked on autonomous vehicles, was frustrated in his role at Google. He wanted to commercialize self-driving technology but Google was moving slowly. 
- Levandowski had a history of working on autonomous vehicles, including building a motorcycle called Ghostrider for the DARPA challenge. Though it crashed quickly, the experience inspired his passion for self-driving technology.

 Here's a summary:

- Anthony Levandowski was an engineer who worked at Google and helped develop Google's self-driving car technology. He was ambitious, smart, and eager to push the technology forward. 
- Levandowski formed a startup called 510 Systems to build sensors and software for self-driving cars. He then sold the technology to Google through a middleman, making $20 million in the process. 
- Levandowski wanted to do real-world testing of self-driving cars, but Google was hesitant because of safety and public perception concerns. Levandowski grew frustrated with the slow pace.
- Levandowski's leadership style irritated some colleagues. He hired a lobbyist to get favorable laws passed in Nevada without telling Google. He tried to become the leader of Google's self-driving car unit but was passed over, leaving him disgruntled. 
- Travis Kalanick, Uber's CEO, was obsessed with growth. He expected employees to work long hours to help Uber expand into new cities, even if it meant battling regulators and taxi companies.
- Taxi companies felt threatened by Uber. They had paid large amounts of money for taxi "medallions" that gave them the right to operate, but Uber disrupted that model. Some taxi drivers committed suicide due to financial troubles. Others protested and lobbied against Uber.
- In summary, Levandowski and Kalanick were ambitious leaders who pushed for rapid advancement of self-driving and ride-sharing technology. However, their aggressive tactics created conflicts with colleagues, regulators, and competitors that would come back to haunt them.

 Here's a summary:

Taxi companies initially tried competing with Uber by creating their own apps but soon found it more effective to protect their turf through regulation and lobbying. When Uber entered a new city, taxi companies would report them to transit authorities and lobby legislators to shut them down. They also sometimes resorted to violence against Uber drivers and employees. 

Uber's strategy was to enter markets quickly before regulations could stop them. They promised drivers they would cover any costs from tickets or fines. They lobbied heavily against regulations like fingerprint background checks that would slow their growth. They spent millions on lobbyists and were willing to threaten to pull out of markets if they didn't get their way.

If lobbying failed, Uber would mount public campaigns to turn riders against legislators trying to regulate them. They would modify their app to show longer wait times and urge riders to contact lawmakers. They hired engineers to build tools that could automatically spam lawmakers and rally users. They gathered hundreds of thousands of petitions and signatures supporting them. As a last resort, they would stage publicity stunts like delivering boxes labeled as containing petitions to lawmakers' offices, even though the boxes actually contained water bottles.

Uber took an aggressive "ask forgiveness, not permission" approach. They entered markets quickly to build popularity before dealing with regulations. They were willing to spend huge amounts of money and use questionable tactics to fight regulations. Their goal was to push for complete deregulation so they could define drivers as independent contractors, avoiding costs like benefits and insurance. Kalanick's approach was to treat each market like a "hostage situation" and was willing to pull out of markets entirely if he didn't get his way.

 Here's a summary:

Travis Kalanick, Uber's CEO, couldn't understand why he was so disliked and criticized. He saw himself as an ambitious CEO celebrating competitiveness, but others saw him as arrogant and abrasive. 

Kalanick's comments in media profiles made him seem like an out-of-touch "bro." He bragged about how his success attracted women and name-dropped expensive hotels. The public saw him as an entitled, rich tech founder exploiting workers. Kalanick didn't understand the criticism and blamed "perception versus reality."

Sarah Lacy, a tech journalist, frequently criticized Kalanick and Uber's culture. Kalanick felt she was unfairly targeting him. He asked Emil Michael, his deputy, "How would they like it if we did it to them?"

Bill Gurley, an early Uber investor, initially supported Kalanick's competitiveness but grew concerned with Kalanick's obsession with international expansion and spending. Kalanick began to resent Gurley's doubts and criticism. Kalanick slowly iced Gurley out of important meetings and conversations. Gurley tried influencing Kalanick through others but had little direct power due to Kalanick limiting investor control.

Overall, the summary depicts Kalanick as combative and unwilling to accept criticism. His abrasive style and comments created a poor public image that he blamed on perception rather than his own actions. Internally, he resented one of his earliest supporters, Bill Gurley, for expressing reasonable concerns about Kalanick's leadership and strategy.

 

- Bill Gurley, an Uber board member and investor, was increasingly worried about Travis Kalanick’s leadership and spending. Gurley spoke frequently with Emil Michael, Uber’s chief business officer, to express his concerns, but Kalanick dismissed them. 

- Gurley was especially upset that Kalanick had pushed out Uber’s CFO, Brent Callinicos, and failed to hire a strong replacement. Gurley also felt Uber’s legal department was weak and unable to properly monitor Uber’s global operations. 

- At a meeting, Ryan Graves, head of Uber operations, told general managers to prioritize growth over following laws and regulations. Kalanick wanted to preserve Uber’s startup culture and gave general managers a lot of autonomy. 

- To warn Kalanick, Gurley wrote a series of blog posts cautioning tech companies about risky spending and “dead unicorns,” privately aimed at Uber. At a conference, Gurley warned publicly that some tech unicorns were overvalued. Kalanick and Michael dismissed Gurley’s concerns.

- To improve media relations, Uber’s communications head Nairi Hourdajian arranged a dinner between Kalanick and journalists at the Waverly Inn, a New York restaurant popular with media figures. Kalanick wanted to convince journalists he wasn’t a “monster.”

- At the dinner, Kalanick sat between Arianna Huffington and a Fortune editor. Emil Michael spoke with journalist Michael Wolff and BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith. Smith was surprised when Michael openly criticized Uber’s relationship with the media.

 Here's a summary:

- Uber prized MBA graduates and people with an aggressive, competitive mindset. 
- Uber's culture valued winning at all costs. Employees were told they should have a "champion's mindset" and the best ideas would rise to the top in a "meritocracy". 
- In reality, Uber's culture was cutthroat. Employees had to constantly watch their backs or they might be betrayed by colleagues looking to get ahead. Success meant defeating others.
- Josh Mohrer embodied Uber's ideal employee. He was the general manager for Uber's New York City operations. Mohrer was known for browbeating his employees and pitting them against each other. 
- Mohrer loved to fight, which was useful in New York where Uber faced a strong transportation union. 
- Uber's culture valued an "alpha male" mindset. While not all MBA grads were aggressive, many of the aggressive ones felt at home at Uber.

In summary, Uber cultivated an ultra-competitive, combative culture that valued winning over all else. Employees were constantly trying to one-up each other to gain favor and advance their careers.

 Here's a summary:
- Ryan Graves, the head of operations, was also in charge of HR. But he wasn't focused on day-to-day HR issues. Renee Atwood, the head of HR, seemed overwhelmed. As a result, HR was ill-equipped to handle complaints and issues. 
- Managers throughout the company, especially in high-performing offices, were abusive towards employees. They would scream, throw things, and threaten employees. But they were not disciplined because they produced good results.
- The company had an algorithm to determine the lowest salary a candidate would accept, to save money. They also added a "Safe Rides Fee" of $1 per trip, claiming it was for safety, but really it went straight to profits.
- The culture was immature and unprofessional. Employees wrote blog posts joking about "rides of glory" the morning after one-night stands.
- Departments competed fiercely for "incentives" - the money Uber gave away to riders and drivers to spur growth. Whoever controlled incentives held power, so departments vied for control of the incentives budget. This internal competition was encouraged by Kalanick.
- Kalanick was very data-driven and didn't listen to arguments not backed by data. He resisted adding a tipping function for years despite drivers wanting it, because he felt it disrupted the "frictionless" experience. 
- Some employees challenged Kalanick, like Aaron Schildkrout, the head of driver product. But Kalanick usually got his way.

 

- Travis Kalanick, the CEO of Uber, wanted to expand into China, a challenging market. 
- Thuan Pham, Uber's CTO, was in charge of Uber's engineering teams in China. Although the number of Uber trips were increasing rapidly in China, Pham was not happy because Uber was spending $40-50 million per week in subsidies to gain market share. 
- Kalanick was confident Uber could succeed in China, despite the obstacles like Didi Chuxing, Uber's main competitor, and the Chinese government's support for local companies. Kalanick got excited about accomplishing difficult tasks.
- Pham had to deal with the problems of Uber's fast growth in China on a daily basis. Uber had teams in many Chinese cities competing against Didi Chuxing. Although Pham's team respected him, the rapid expansion was challenging. 
- Kalanick warned investors that Uber would spend heavily to gain a strong position in China. But he did not reveal how much Uber was actually spending on subsidies for fake trips. Uber's trips were growing very fast in China, but many were subsidized, fake trips.
- Kalanick saw huge potential in China, possibly even bigger than in the US. But the reality was that Uber was spending tens of millions per week on subsidies for drivers and riders, many for fake trips that generated no revenue.

In summary, Kalanick was determined to succeed in China, but scaling Uber's operations there was difficult and expensive. Much of the rapid growth was fueled by massive subsidies, including many for fake, unprofitable trips. Pham had to deal with the challenges of managing Uber's engineering team during this expensive, fast expansion into China.

 

Tony Pham was Uber's CTO who was in charge of dealing with the fraud in China. Pham came from a difficult background, escaping Vietnam as a refugee at a young age. He worked his way up in tech, ending up with a high-level role at Uber.

Pham's job was to fix Uber's failing China strategy. He formed a 50-person fraud team to tackle scams, which were costing Uber millions. They helped take down drug and prostitution rings in New York using stolen credit cards and Uber. The team then built machine learning to detect fraud.

Chinese fraud was even worse, with drivers and riders working together to scam incentives. Scammers connected on forums and used burner phones and stolen credit cards to rack up fake rides. Some had hundreds of phones to automate fake rides. Despite the team's efforts, fraud remained rampant.

Uber and Didi, its Chinese competitor, also played dirty. Didi sabotaged Uber by paying taxi drivers to protest, sending fake messages to drivers, and planting moles. Didi's investor Tencent also occasionally blocked Uber's WeChat account, cutting them off from China's biggest social network and payment system.

Some of Uber's issues were self-inflicted. They relied on Google Maps, which didn't work well in China. They were slow to accept Chinese mobile payments. And while Didi localized to China, Uber's app felt foreign. 

In summary, fraud, a tough competitor, and some missteps made China an economic disaster for Uber. Pham's fraud team helped reduce losses, but couldn't overcome the bigger challenges.

 Here's a summary:

Uber was struggling with major losses and issues in China. CEO Travis Kalanick put pressure on his engineers to fix the problems quickly by any means necessary. 

Kalanick's CTO, Thuan Pham, created an anti-fraud strike team and gave them ample resources and independence to solve issues. One member of the team was Quentin, a 30-year-old former Google employee known for being cautious and clever. 

By October 2014, Uber had grown from 500 to over 1,500 employees. Quentin led a team of over 150 people focused on risk, security, fraud prevention. They worked hard to limit losses, helping with drug busts, fraud prevention in China, and other issues costing Uber money.

Quentin's team faced a specific problem: massive account fraud linked to Apple devices. People were creating thousands of fake rider and driver accounts using jailbroken iPhones. It was costing Uber millions each month.

 

- Years earlier, Apple released an iOS update that removed access to iPhone IMEI numbers, unique device identifiers. This aligned with Apple’s focus on user privacy under CEO Tim Cook.

- This update caused problems for Uber, which had been using IMEI numbers to track fraud. Uber then contracted with InAuth to find workaround and track IMEIs again. But this violated Apple’s rules, so Uber had to keep it secret.

- In 2014, an Android hacker published details about the extensive data permissions Uber’s app requested, including access to texts, contacts, camera, etc. This was actually due to Uber’s secret deal with InAuth, but the public didn’t know that. The news caused a scandal.

- A few weeks later, Apple rejected Uber’s latest iOS app update. Uber’s deal with InAuth had been discovered.

- Eddy Cue, Apple’s head of internet software and services, had interacted with Travis Kalanick before. Cue and Tim Cook met with Kalanick and were struck by his arrogance. Kalanick dismissed concerns about Uber’s reputation and regulation, saying “I know what the hell I’m doing.”

- When Cue suggested Uber’s deal with Google Ventures could be a threat, Kalanick said “The board is irrelevant...They do what I tell them.” This attitude surprised Cue.

- Though concerned, Apple stayed in regular contact with Uber given its status as a top app. But tensions were building behind the scenes.

 

- Apple’s headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. Although Uber was a popular app, it frequently frustrated Apple by trying to circumvent App Store rules. 
- When Uber submitted software updates, Apple engineers would often catch Uber trying to sneak unwanted code into the app. Apple scolded Uber and required them to follow the rules.
- In late 2014, Uber tried to trick Apple by using geofencing to hide unauthorized code in the app. Uber’s app would behave differently if used near Apple’s headquarters. An Apple reviewer outside California discovered the unauthorized code.
- Eddy Cue, Apple’s head of services, was furious when he found out. He called Travis Kalanick and demanded Kalanick come discuss the issue in person.
- At the meeting, Cue and Phil Schiller, Apple’s head of marketing, criticized Kalanick for deceiving Apple. Cue threatened to remove Uber from the App Store if Kalanick didn’t promise it would never happen again.
- Kalanick apologized and promised not to deceive Apple again. Uber was put on probation, and now had to provide more documentation for software updates. Cue warned Kalanick that another violation would get Uber banned. 
- A few weeks later, Kalanick met with Tim Cook and Eddy Cue again. Kalanick was worried, but the meeting went smoothly. Uber was allowed to remain in the App Store.

 

Travis Kalanick, the CEO of Uber, wore red shoes and striped socks to a meeting with Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple. Kalanick was nervous about the meeting because Uber and Apple had recently had a disagreement. During the meeting, Cook said he wanted to make sure the issue was resolved and that it wouldn’t happen again. Kalanick apologized and assured Cook it wouldn’t. Cook accepted the apology but warned Kalanick that if Uber ever tried to deceive Apple again, Uber would no longer be allowed on Apple’s platforms. 

After the meeting, Kalanick told a friend he felt shaken but then regained his confidence, feeling that if Uber could stand up to Apple, it could stand up to anyone.

Around the same time, Kalanick hired Joe Sullivan as Uber’s chief security officer. Sullivan had previously worked as Facebook’s chief security officer. When he joined Uber, Sullivan discovered the company had major security issues, including:

•Tracking riders and collecting their data without consent. Uber had programs to monitor Lyft drivers and riders.

•Thousands of cases of misconduct and assault, including many sexual assaults, that were kept quiet. Uber had created their own system to categorize the different types of sexual assaults reported. Kalanick often dismissed the accusations, saying the drivers were “innocent until proven guilty.”

•A massive data breach in 2014 that compromised 50,000 Uber drivers’ information. Uber had failed to report the breach as required by law.

Sullivan said he wanted to make security a key part of Uber’s brand and that it should aim to be safer than taxis. He asked to report directly to Kalanick, who agreed. Sullivan decided to take the job at Uber despite the many issues, believing he could help improve the company.

 

- Joe Sullivan studied cyberlaw and worked as a lawyer in the 1990s, prosecuting trade secret and corporate espionage cases. 
- By the early 2000s, he had established himself as a reputable lawyer known for going after cybercriminals. 
- In 2002, Sullivan got a job at eBay, where he led trust and safety efforts to combat fraud. He successfully took down major fraud rings, including Romanians running scams on eBay.  
- Sullivan then worked at PayPal and Facebook, where he pursued "bad actors" like spammers, scammers, cyberbullies, and cybercriminals. He took an aggressive approach to security.
- While at Facebook, Sullivan's friend was being blackmailed by a Nigerian scammer she met on Match.com. Sullivan tracked down the scammer, gained access to his computer, and discovered he was running a large blackmail scheme targeting women in Silicon Valley. Sullivan stopped the scheme and notified the victims.  
- In 2015, Sullivan was recruited to join Uber to help improve its security practices. Uber had faced data breaches, fraud, competitors, and other issues that Sullivan aimed to address in his new role as Chief Security Officer. However, bigger issues awaited him at Uber.

In summary, Joe Sullivan was a seasoned cybersecurity expert and lawyer known for aggressively going after cybercriminals. He held senior security roles at major tech companies like eBay, PayPal, Facebook, and eventually Uber, where he aimed to overhaul their security practices. However, he faced significant challenges in his role at Uber.

 

Travis Kalanick, the CEO of Uber, was angry while attending the 2014 Code Conference. During the conference, Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google and an investor in Uber, announced Google’s self-driving car project. Kalanick saw this as a threat to Uber’s business. If Google created an autonomous ride-sharing service, they could charge very little and take all of Uber’s customers. 

When asked on stage if Google had plans to start a ride-hailing service, Brin was noncommittal. He said Google would operate the self-driving car service at first but was unsure of long term plans. Kalanick started worrying that Google’s substantial resources would allow them to pursue risky, expensive projects like self-driving cars.

Kalanick contacted David Drummond, Google’s chief legal officer who was also on Uber’s board of directors. Drummond was expecting to hear from Kalanick after Brin’s announcement. Drummond and other Google executives discussed how to tell Kalanick about Brin’s demonstration beforehand but Drummond didn’t inform Kalanick until the last minute. Though usually adept at handling tense situations, Drummond avoided conflict and delayed telling Kalanick.

Kalanick frequently heard rumors of Google’s self-driving car project and possible taxi service. Each time, Kalanick would email Drummond for information. Kalanick wanted a meeting to discuss the self-driving car project and ensure Google remained a partner rather than a competitor. Drummond agreed to meet, aiming to reassure Kalanick of Google’s partnership and support of Uber’s success. However, Drummond knew Google’s ambitions could threaten Uber. The meeting highlighted the complicated relationship between the companies.

 Here's a summary:

- Travis Kalanick, the CEO of Uber, felt betrayed by Google, one of Uber's major investors, after Sergey Brin unveiled Google's self-driving car plans. Kalanick had thought Google would partner with Uber, not compete against it. 
- David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, tried to smooth things over with Kalanick but was unsuccessful. At a conference, Brin flirted with Kalanick's girlfriend, causing further anger. 
- Anthony Levandowski, an engineer who worked on Google's autonomous vehicle team, was frustrated with the slow progress and wanted more control. He left Google to start his own self-driving truck company, Otto. 
- Levandowski and Kalanick secretly met and bonded over their vision for a future with self-driving vehicles. Levandowski had the engineering skill, and Kalanick had the network from Uber.
- Otto launched with a viral video of its self-driving truck. Levandowski didn't follow regulations to get permits for filming and faced no consequences. The culture at Otto was fast-moving, with the motto "Safety Third."
- Kalanick and Levandowski's first meeting seemed destined. Despite their companies being competitors, they clicked and imagined partnering together. They had secret meetings where they discussed working together.

In summary, Kalanick felt betrayed by Google but found a kindred spirit in Levandowski. Although their companies were rivals, they bonded over a shared vision for autonomous vehicles and self-driving trucks. They began plotting in secret to work together despite being competitors.

 

- Things were going well for Travis Kalanick and Uber. Uber had raised $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia, valuing the company at $62.5 billion. 

- Kalanick had previously met with Lyft’s co-founders to discuss acquiring Lyft. However, the talks fell apart over disagreement on Lyft’s valuation. Kalanick didn’t really want to buy Lyft anyway and preferred to compete against them.

- The Saudi investment gave Kalanick more power and control at Uber. He got the board to approve a provision giving him sole power to appoint three new directors. Some board members, like Bill Gurley, were nervous about this but went along with it given the investment.

- The Saudi money allowed Uber to overwhelm competitors globally, including DiDi in China, Grab and Go-Jek in Southeast Asia, Ola in India, and Lyft in the US. Kalanick took pleasure in hurting Lyft.

- Uber engineers built a prototype to detect when Lyft drivers were using the Lyft app so Uber could target them. However, the feature was never implemented due to privacy concerns. Kalanick generally neglected user privacy in favor of data collection. 

- Kalanick and Uber were faster and more aggressive than Lyft. Kalanick poached Lyft employees, like Travis VanderZanden. Uber outmaneuvered Lyft at every turn.

 

- John VanderZanden was Lyft’s COO before he joined Uber in 2014. This move typified Travis Kalanick’s ruthlessness and willingness to weaken competitors. 
- Jeff Jones joined Uber in 2016 to improve its poor reputation and relationship with drivers. However, in one of his first attempts at outreach, drivers angrily confronted him over low pay and poor treatment. Jones realized he was in over his head.
- Shervin Pishevar, an early Uber investor, encouraged Kalanick to embrace a lavish lifestyle. Kalanick and Pishevar partied with celebrities, gave away Uber equity, and travelled in private jets and limos. Friends said Kalanick was living out his longtime fantasy of being a “baller.”
- Kalanick learned ruthless business tactics from his former mentor Michael Ovitz. Kalanick applied these lessons at Uber, seeking to crush competitors like Lyft.

 

- Travis Kalanick, CEO of Uber, loved to party and surround himself with celebrities. He became obsessed with getting Oprah Winfrey on Uber’s board of directors to raise the company’s profile. Though he failed in getting Oprah, he succeeded in attracting hip-hop star Jay-Z as an early investor. 
- Uber’s culture under Kalanick was domineering, aggressive and sexist. Offices around the world engaged in frequent partying, drug use and harassment. When a female employee in Malaysia feared being raped, her manager responded that Uber has great health insurance to pay for any medical bills. The office culture was toxic but the potential for big financial payoffs kept many employees content.
- Three months before Susan Fowler published her blog post exposing Uber’s culture, the technology industry was still widely admired. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president in November 2016 marked a turning point. Tech companies were blamed for enabling Trump’s victory through propaganda and misinformation on social media platforms. The media and public turned on the tech industry, realizing the power of companies like Google and Facebook to influence opinions through targeted advertising.

- Kalanick’s 40th birthday featured a lavish multi-yacht party in Greece with models and expensive alcohol, showing how far he and Uber had come. But Susan Fowler was just starting a new job after leaving Uber, still disgusted and traumatized by her experiences there the past year. She finally published a blog post titled “Reflecting on One Very, Very Strange Year at Uber” exposing the company’s toxic culture.

 

Dan O’Sullivan, a tech worker and freelance writer in Chicago, despised Donald Trump and his administration. He believed Trump was incompetent and unfit for the presidency. While O’Sullivan worked at a dreary call center job during the day, he found solace connecting with like-minded people on Twitter in his spare time. Under the handle @Bro_Pair, O’Sullivan discussed politics and made fun of Trump with his online friends. 

One week after Trump’s inauguration, the president signed an executive order banning refugees and travelers from several predominantly Muslim countries. Trump claimed the ban was meant to protect the U.S. from “radical Islamic terrorists,” but O’Sullivan saw it as inhumane.

The day after Trump signed the Muslim ban, protests erupted at airports across the country. Thousands gathered to condemn the policy and demand the release of detained immigrants and refugees. The protests were disorganized but passionate. O’Sullivan wanted to join in and show his opposition to Trump's actions.

On his way to O’Hare International Airport in Chicago to protest, O’Sullivan tried to order an Uber to get there. But the Uber app was surging prices due to high demand around the airport. Frustrated, O’Sullivan vented on Twitter that Uber was “trying to profit off of refugees being consigned to death in their home countries.”

O’Sullivan’s angry tweet at Uber caught the attention of his followers. His outrage spread, and soon the hashtag #DeleteUber began trending on Twitter. Thousands pledged to delete their Uber accounts to protest the company’s alleged profiteering during the crisis. The social media backlash battered Uber’s brand and stock price.

Travis Kalanick, Uber’s CEO, scrambled to contain the crisis. He insisted Uber had not actually raised prices, and said the higher fares were simply due to increased demand around the airport protests. But it was too late. #DeleteUber had taken on a life of its own, fueled by anti-Trump sentiment and a growing distaste for large tech companies. Kalanick’s association with Trump’s business advisory council only made things worse. 

In the end, Kalanick had to apologize and leave Trump’s council to stem the PR crisis. #DeleteUber caused the worst public relations disaster in Uber’s history and showed how a single tweet could ignite outrage and threaten a company’s success.

 Here's a summary:

Dan O'Sullivan, a left-leaning writer, was outraged by Donald Trump's 2017 travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries. However, O'Sullivan felt hopeful seeing Americans protest the ban at airports. 

O'Sullivan noticed Uber was turning off surge pricing at JFK airport during the protests. He interpreted this as Uber trying to profit from the protests and break a taxi strike. Already disliking Uber's business practices, O'Sullivan snapped and tweeted criticism at Uber, suggesting the hashtag #deleteUber.

The #deleteUber hashtag resonated and went viral. Thousands of people tweeted at Uber in outrage and deleted their Uber accounts. The movement was a way for people to protest Trump, tech companies, and "Big Tech" greed. 

Uber scrambled to respond as account deletions flooded in. Uber's CEO Travis Kalanick attempted to apologize but only made things worse by reminding people he was working with the Trump administration. The #deleteUber movement caused major problems for Uber.

 Here's a summary:

Susan Fowler was a twenty-four-year-old engineer who joined Uber in November 2015. She came from a poor family in rural Arizona and had overcome obstacles to get an Ivy League education and land an engineering job at Uber, one of the hottest tech companies. 

On her first day of work, Fowler's manager sent her inappropriate chat messages saying he was struggling to find new sexual partners and insinuating he might pursue a relationship with her. She was shocked by this unprofessional behavior.

Fowler loved her job as a site reliability engineer at Uber, helping to keep the platform running and available 24/7. However, she soon faced hostility and poor treatment as one of the few female engineers. Her manager's propositions were a sign of the widespread sexism at the company.

Fowler's story foreshadows the crises Uber would face in 2017 due to its toxic culture and treatment of employees. Her dream job turned into a "very, very strange year at Uber."

 

- Susan Fowler was excited to start her new job as a site reliability engineer at Uber in 2016. However, on her first day, she was sexually harassed by her manager over the company’s internal chat system. 
- She reported the incident to HR, expecting the manager to be fired. However, HR told her it was the manager’s first offense and he would only receive a warning since he was a “high performer.” They gave Fowler the choice to stay on the team under him or find a new team. 
- Fowler switched teams but soon discovered that her former manager had a history of harassing other women. She realized HR did not properly handle these issues and protected “high performers.”
- The chaotic work environment and flawed performance review system at Uber led to backstabbing and reorganizations. It was especially difficult for women, who made up only 25% of Fowler’s department. 
- Six women in Fowler’s division, including Fowler, never received the promised leather jackets. Their measurements were “lost.” This was emblematic of how Uber mistreated and failed to value women.
- Fowler eventually left Uber, disillusioned with the company culture and treatment of women. She later wrote a blog post about her experiences that led to investigations, reforms, and the resignation of Uber's CEO Travis Kalanick.

In summary, Fowler faced sexual harassment, a chaotic and misogynistic work environment, and a flawed HR department that protected poorly behaved managers and failed to properly address workplace issues, especially those impacting women. Her speaking out helped spur major changes at Uber.

 

- Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer, published a blog post describing her terrible experience working at Uber, including her manager coming onto her and HR's lack of action. The post went viral internally and externally.

- The blog post unleashed a flood of pent-up complaints from Uber employees. Morale was already low, and many were leaving for competitors. The post made things worse.

- Travis Kalanick, Uber's CEO, flew back to deal with the crisis. He decided to hire Eric Holder and Tammy Albarrán from the law firm Covington & Burling to conduct an independent investigation into Fowler's allegations and Uber's culture.

- Rachel Whetstone, Uber's head of communications, warned that bringing in outside investigators could lead Uber to lose control as more issues came to light. However, she suggested Holder specifically as someone with integrity.

- Kalanick told employees in a memo that Holder and Albarrán would investigate Fowler's claims and diversity/inclusion issues at Uber. He also shared statistics showing women make up 15.1% of engineers, product managers and scientists at Uber, slightly lower than at major tech competitors.

- The outside investigation would ultimately lead to even bigger issues at Uber coming to light. Kalanick did not fully understand how thorough the investigation would be.

 

- Travis Kalanick, Uber's CEO, sent an email to employees apologizing for the company's issues with sexism and announcing plans to release a diversity report and improve the culture. The email eased tensions internally, but some saw it as too little, too late. 

- Kalanick relied heavily on Arianna Huffington, an Uber board member, to help repair the company's image. Kalanick and Huffington first met in 2012, and she joined Uber's board in 2016. Kalanick grew very close with Huffington over the next six months.

- Huffington was born in Greece and moved to London as a teen. She attended Cambridge, wrote books, and married Michael Huffington, a Republican politician. She was once conservative but became progressive, launching the liberal Huffington Post website. She sold it for $315 million in 2011. Huffington was charismatic, well-connected, and a master of reinvention who was hard to define ideologically.

- Kalanick's relationship with Huffington deepened at a time when he had just broken up with his girlfriend of two years, Gabi Holzwarth. Kalanick invited Huffington to join Uber's board in 2016 after pitching his vision for the company's future over a four-hour conversation at her home. She supported his ambitious goals for Uber.

 

- Arianna Huffington was accused of plagiarism twice in her career. The first time, she settled out of court. The second accuser never filed a lawsuit. 
- Travis Kalanick did not want Uber to become a delivery service and was largely uninterested in the logistics of mail delivery.
- Larry Page founded Waymo, a self-driving car company, after becoming CEO of Alphabet. He was very invested in self-driving cars and making futuristic technology a reality.
- Anthony Levandowski was a star engineer at Waymo who left to found his own self-driving startup called Otto. He then sold Otto to Uber for $600 million, angering Page. 
- Investigators found that before leaving Waymo, Levandowski had downloaded 14,000 confidential Waymo files to his laptop. The files included designs for Waymo's lidar systems. Levandowski then wiped his laptop. Other Otto employees had also taken files from Waymo.
- Waymo sued Uber and Otto, claiming they had stolen Waymo's intellectual property and trade secrets. Page personally ordered the lawsuit to send a message that stealing from him would not be tolerated. 
- Jeff Jones, Uber's president of ridesharing, studied Uber's brand problems and found that much of the public's hatred toward Uber was linked to Kalanick himself. 
- Just after Susan Fowler's blog post, the Waymo lawsuit and news that Uber's new hire Amit Singhal had allegedly sexually harassed women at Google further damaged Uber's image. 
- Jones commissioned surveys on how people viewed Uber and Kalanick separately. He shared the results with Uber's executives but asked Kalanick not to attend that meeting.

 
- Jeff Jones, Uber's president of ridesharing, scheduled a meeting with Uber's executives in the Financial District to review the results of surveys on how Uber is perceived.

- The surveys showed that while people liked using Uber, they didn't like Travis Kalanick and his negative image was hurting Uber's brand.

- Kalanick showed up uninvited. At first, he denied the results but some of his executives were able to convince him to listen.

- During the meeting, Rachel Whetstone got a call about a video of Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver that Bloomberg published. They watched the video which made Kalanick look bad.

- Kalanick started blaming others and lashing out. He accused Whetstone and Jill Hazelbaker of not being strategic or creative enough to help. They quit but Kalanick convinced them to stay.

- Kalanick, his executives and Whetstone went to Hazelbaker's place. Kalanick kept saying he was a terrible person. They issued an apology statement and Kalanick sent an apology memo to employees.

- The video and events were a reflection of Kalanick's leadership and showed he needed to change and mature as a leader. The criticism was a reminder that he needed leadership help, which he admitted for the first time.  

- He apologized to the driver, Uber's drivers and riders, and his team.

- The story shows how Kalanick's behavior and refusal to take responsibility were hurting Uber, and how even his executives had trouble reasoning with him. It took a major public crisis for him to realize he needed to change.

 

- In February 2017, Susan Fowler published a blog post describing the harassment and discrimination she experienced as an engineer at Uber. Her post helped spark a wider movement against sexual harassment and abuse in tech.

- The author began investigating Uber's culture after Fowler's post. A source at Uber, "Bob," contacted the author and shared details about some of Uber's unethical practices.

- Bob asked to meet the author in person to discuss "Greyball," a secret software tool Uber used to evade law enforcement. Bob took precautions to avoid being discovered by Uber, instructing the author to delete the Uber app and leave her phone behind.

- Bob showed the author documents and a YouTube video demonstrating how Uber used Greyball to deceive undercover government agents trying to catch Uber operating illegally. Uber identified likely law enforcement officers through methods like checking accounts tied to police credit unions. Uber then used Greyball to hide information in the Uber app from those users.

- Greyball was created to help Uber launch its low-cost UberX service in cities where it was prohibited. It was very effective in helping Uber evade law enforcement in cities like Philadelphia.

- The Greyball program was outlined in an internal Uber document called the "Violation of Terms of Service" or VTOS playbook. The playbook claimed that law enforcement officers using the Uber app violated Uber's terms of service, justifying the use of Greyball against them.

- Greyball helped Uber overcome opposition as it launched in new markets around the world. The program spread widely throughout Uber.

 Here's a summary:

- An Uber employee named Bob leaked information about Uber's use of a tool called Greyball to evade law enforcement. Greyball used Uber's app to identify and block officials in places where Uber was banned or restricted. 

- Bob met with a reporter and explained how Greyball worked. He said he felt relieved to finally tell someone, even though it could be illegal. He hoped it might change something. After the meeting, Bob disappeared and his phone number was disconnected.

- On March 3, 2017, the New York Times published an article exposing Uber's use of Greyball. There was major backlash, with government investigations and employee attrition. Uber's reputation suffered greatly.

- Uber's president of ridesharing, Jeff Jones, resigned shortly after, citing Uber's leadership and culture as the reason. Kalanick tried to claim Jones left because he didn't get promoted to COO, but Jones rebutted this, blaming the company's leadership.

- Around the same time, Gabi Holzwarth, Kalanick's ex-girlfriend, received a call from Emil Michael, Uber's SVP of business. Holzwarth reflected on her unhealthy relationship with Kalanick and some of his questionable behavior, including an incident in 2014 in Seoul, South Korea.

- While in Seoul to deal with issues launching UberX, Kalanick, Michael, Holzwarth and others ended up at a karaoke bar where the female employees had numbers attached to their skirts and would sing and drink with customers, sometimes leaving with them. Though Kalanick and Michael didn't directly participate, they seemed indifferent. An Uber employee complained to HR but little was done.

- Now, in March 2017, Michael had texted Holzwarth out of the blue, despite no contact since their breakup.

 Here's a summary:

- Travis Kalanick and Gabi Holzwarth had broken up in late 2016. Emil Michael, Kalanick's second-in-command, called Holzwarth to press her to stay silent about an unspecified incident that occurred during a trip to South Korea. Holzwarth felt threatened and upset by the call.  

- Holzwarth reported the call to Rachel Whetstone, Uber's head of communications, who told other executives. They were angry at Michael for his reckless behavior. 

- Michael then tried to apologize to Holzwarth and sent other women to contact her, but she remained upset. Holzwarth felt Michael was trying to bully her into silence, just as Uber bullied its critics.

- Holzwarth decided to tell a tech journalist about the Korea incident, Michael's call, and her relationship with Kalanick. This further damaged Kalanick's reputation, which was already suffering from multiple scandals.

- Meanwhile, Anthony Levandowski's leadership of Uber's self-driving car program had become a liability. Levandowski had launched an illegal test program and lied about an accident. Uber's board pressured Kalanick to fire Levandowski, though Kalanick was reluctant to do so. Eventually, Levandowski was fired. 

- Uber's crises led the company to release its first diversity report and make public relations efforts to appear transparent and apologetic. Executives like Liane Hornsey and Arianna Huffington took on more prominent roles in these efforts.

 Here's a summary:

- In late March 2017, Uber settled a lawsuit regarding its "Hell" program that targeted Lyft drivers. This quelled public anger for a couple weeks.

- Then, in April 2017, it was revealed that Uber had been illegally using technology to track Lyft drivers and lure them to Uber. Uber had also been tracking competitors internationally, like DiDi in China and Ola in India. 

- Uber's "Strategic Services Group" or SSG, consisting of ex-CIA and FBI agents, conducted espionage on competitors. They impersonated drivers, tracked people, took secret photos, and recorded private conversations. Uber's CEO Travis Kalanick directly oversaw their large budgets.

- Many were uncomfortable with Uber's practices, like mass internal data deletion. There were also bribery problems, like in Indonesia where Uber paid police bribes to allow their illegal "green light hubs."

- By Spring 2017, Uber was facing many issues that threatened its $70B valuation. External lawyers were investigating, concerning Kalanick. But he may not have fully appreciated the gravity.

- Kalanick's friend Eric Alexander was fired in 2017. Though president of Uber's Asia Pacific division, Alexander mainly acted as Kalanick's "fixer." He had obtained and shared the medical records of a woman raped by an Uber driver in India, compromising her privacy.

 

- Travis Kalanick, the CEO of Uber, was aware of the details of an investigation into an alleged rape of an Uber passenger in India by her driver. 

- Initially, some Uber executives floated the theory that the rape may have been faked as part of a plot against Uber by its competitor Ola. Kalanick himself raised details from the victim's medical report that cast doubt on her claims.

- A Uber executive named Eric Alexander carried around confidential details about the medical examination. When this was discovered, Kalanick fired him to avoid public backlash. 

- Other executives were outraged by Kalanick's handling of the incident and his apparent doubts about the victim's claims. They wrote a letter to Uber's board demanding Kalanick take a leave of absence and for other problem executives like Emil Michael to be fired.

- Shortly after, Kalanick's parents were in a boating accident. His mother was killed and his father was critically injured. Kalanick flew to be with his family. 

- During this time, Kalanick worked with Arianna Huffington to draft a letter apologizing to Uber staff for his mistakes and failures as a leader. He acknowledged Uber had grown very quickly without proper oversight and governance. The letter was meant to save Kalanick's job as CEO.

- Kalanick reflected that he had always been focused on survival as an entrepreneur and had not developed the skills to lead a large organization. But he said his mother had always encouraged him to appreciate the people that made Uber successful.

 

- Uber’s board of directors met on June 11 to discuss the findings and recommendations in the Holder report. The report was hundreds of pages long and detailed many issues within Uber including sexual harassment and violence. 

- The top recommendations from the report were that Travis Kalanick take a leave of absence, relinquish control of the company, hire a COO, fire Emil Michael, and appoint an independent board chair.

- The board was split on the recommendations but ultimately voted unanimously to accept them. Some wanted even harsher penalties for Kalanick while others were loyal to him. But there was agreement that reforms were needed.

- Emil Michael, Kalanick’s close friend and top deputy, was fired as recommended in the report. Michael was upset to be leaving Uber after helping build it for 4 years. He said farewell to his team, expressing pride in Uber’s accomplishments.

- It was unclear if Kalanick would actually take a leave of absence as recommended. The board and employees were waiting to see what Kalanick would announce at the company all-hands meeting on Tuesday morning.

 Here's a summary of the presentation:

- Uber employees were anxious due to negative press about the company in recent months. The presentation had been delayed several times. 

- Travis Kalanick, Uber's CEO, was not present at the start of the presentation. At the last minute, he emailed employees saying he would take a leave of absence to grieve his mother's recent death and work on himself. Though the timing was unclear, other executives would run the company in his absence.

- Arianna Huffington, an Uber board member, began the presentation. She announced the results of an external report on Uber's culture that recommended Kalanick's role be diminished and subject to more oversight. The full board had unanimously approved the recommendations. 

- Huffington announced a new female board member, Wan-Ling Martello, to help improve diversity. But board member David Bonderman made a sexist comment suggesting female board members talk too much. The room was stunned at his inappropriate remark.

- Huffington attempted to continue the presentation but the mood was awkward following Bonderman's comment. Bonderman was known for openly challenging Kalanick and pushing for changes at the company to protect TPG's investment in Uber. Kalanick disliked Bonderman's demands and input.

- Overall, the presentation did not go as hoped and highlighted some of the very cultural problems Uber was trying to address. Kalanick's leave of absence and diminished role was a step towards change but more work was clearly needed.

 Here's a summary:

- David Bonderman made an inappropriate, sexist comment at Uber's all-hands meeting following the release of the Holder report. His comment derailed the meeting and outraged employees.

- Bill Gurley, a partner at Uber's lead venture capital firm Benchmark, was under immense pressure to fix Uber's problems. He had hoped the meeting would help turn things around, but Bonderman's comment made the situation much worse. 

- Gurley was acting as the "adult in the room" and was fielding calls from Benchmark's limited partners, who had invested hundreds of millions in Uber and were worried about the company's troubles. Gurley was exhausted and stressed from the situation.

- Though Kalanick had pledged to take a leave of absence, he continued running the company directly after the meeting, calling department heads and working with engineers. He had no intention of actually stepping away.

- Gurley knew Kalanick would fight any attempt to force him out permanently. Gurley was also hesitant to take such an aggressive stance, as Benchmark aimed to be seen as "founder-friendly" unlike private equity firms that took more control from founders. 

- The situation at Uber continued to deteriorate, and Gurley struggled over what to do next with his defiant CEO and friend, Travis Kalanick.

 

- Benchmark had invested in Uber early on and stood to make billions from their investment. However, Uber’s many scandals were damaging its reputation and valuation. 
- Some investors like Freada Kapor Klein were criticizing Uber publicly. Others like Katrina Lake, the CEO of Stitch Fix, expressed disappointment to Gurley that he was involved with Uber.
- Gurley realized Kalanick needed to go, but ousting him would be difficult. Kalanick had structured Uber to limit investor influence. He controlled the board through allies and supervoting shares. He had also alienated many investors over time through underhanded tactics.
- Gurley devised a plan to force Kalanick out. He united Uber’s largest shareholders, who collectively held over 25% of Uber’s stock. They would present Kalanick with a letter demanding that he step down as CEO, or they would use their voting power to remove him from the board. 
- The shareholders felt this was necessary to protect their investment in Uber. If Kalanick stayed, Uber’s scandals and bad press would continue to damage the company. By ousting him, they hoped to turn things around.

 

The investor syndicate decided to confront Travis Kalanick about stepping down as Uber's CEO. However, Kalanick was in Chicago interviewing a candidate for Uber's COO position, throwing off the syndicate's plans. The syndicate picked Matt Cohler and Peter Fenton, two Benchmark partners, to fly to Chicago and deliver the news to Kalanick. 

Cohler and Fenton, along with the rest of the syndicate, had spent weeks discussing how to approach Kalanick. They were paranoid about their plans leaking, so they referred to Kalanick using code names when talking in public. They met repeatedly to plan out every possible scenario for confronting Kalanick, drafting different letters for each scenario with the help of lawyers.

Although the confrontation promised to be ugly, the syndicate steeled themselves for what was to come, believing it was necessary to save Uber and their investment. They felt they had done all they could to resolve issues with Kalanick, and now had to take drastic action.

 

- Benchmark and other Uber investors had exhausted all other options to remove Travis Kalanick as CEO. They felt this was the right move for the company. 

- Benchmark partners Matt Cohler and Peter Fenton flew to Chicago to confront Kalanick in person at the Ritz-Carlton hotel. They were accompanied by a crisis communications expert named Steven Rubenstein.

- Gurley remained in Woodside but was coordinating the effort. The group of investors were using WhatsApp and text to communicate. One source had tipped off a New York Times reporter that Kalanick might be ousted that day.

- When Cohler and Fenton met with Kalanick, they asked him to resign as CEO immediately and permanently. They slid him a letter stating this demand, signed by Benchmark and other investors representing 26% of Uber's stock and 39% of voting shares.

- The letter expressed "profound concerns" with Uber's direction and Kalanick's leadership. It said his leadership was damaging Uber's brand and value. It demanded Kalanick's resignation, changes to the board and governance, hiring of a new CFO, and other steps.

- Kalanick was furious, especially given that just a week before board members including Gurley had expressed support for him returning as CEO. But now they were demanding his immediate resignation.

 Here's a summary:

- Travis Kalanick, the CEO of Uber, was plotting by two of the company's investors, Bill Gurley of Benchmark and David Bonderman of TPG, to step down. 

- Gurley and Bonderman presented Kalanick with a letter signed by Uber's largest shareholders demanding his resignation. Kalanick felt betrayed by the investors he once considered allies.

- Kalanick lashed out at the investors but knew he was cornered. The investors gave him until 6pm that day to resign or they would take the fight public and rally more shareholders against him.

- Kalanick started calling allies like Arianna Huffington for help. Huffington was secretly helping draft Kalanick's resignation statement. Meanwhile, Gurley updated the group of investors that Kalanick was stalling.

- Kalanick tried calling shareholders to get their support but was unsuccessful. Investor Shawn Carolan told Kalanick he could no longer support him as CEO.

- As the deadline approached, Kalanick sent proxies like Huffington to negotiate with the investors. Huffington suggested to Kalanick that he should consider resigning. At first, Kalanick resisted but realized he was too tired to keep fighting. 

- However, Kalanick continued stalling for hours. Eventually, the investors threatened to go public with their demands. Huffington urged Kalanick again to resign, and he finally agreed.

- Kalanick met with the investors again and signed the paperwork, though he amended some of the terms. He agreed to step down as CEO but remain on the board. Gurley agreed to step down from the board to avoid dealing with Kalanick.

 

- After Travis Kalanick was ousted as Uber’s CEO, he went to Tahiti to recuperate on Barry Diller’s yacht. Though he initially planned to take time to process what happened, after details of his ouster were leaked to the press, he began plotting his return. 

- Bill Gurley, the venture capitalist who led the push to remove Kalanick, thought the issues with Kalanick were resolved after he stepped down. However, Kalanick continued to meddle in Uber’s daily operations and harass its executives. He tried to get executives and board members to pledge their allegiance to him in case he tried to regain power.

- Uber’s executive leadership team of 14 people urged the board to take further action against Kalanick to stop his interference. They said he had directly reached out to employees, asked an exec to make a major acquisition, and asked for weekly reports on key metrics. They said his actions were undermining the new CEO search and stability of the company.

- The board realized Kalanick would not go quietly and took further steps to reduce his influence. They announced new rules prohibiting Kalanick from meddling and made it clear there was no path for him to return as CEO. The moves further infuriated Kalanick but were necessary to allow Uber to move on.

 

- Travis Kalanick, the ousted CEO of Uber, continued to try to regain power at the company after he was forced to step down. He reached out to employees and asked the executive leadership team (ELT) for their support and votes. He also asked for private employee emails. The ELT and security team refused to provide the information and reported his requests to executives and the board.

- The ELT sent a letter to the board threatening to resign en masse if Kalanick continued his efforts to regain control. In response, Uber’s chief security officer revoked all of Kalanick’s access to Uber’s systems and communications.

- Benchmark, one of Uber’s largest investors, wanted to find a new CEO who could stop Kalanick. They focused on Meg Whitman, the CEO of Hewlett-Packard, who had advised Uber in the past. Whitman demanded that Kalanick be completely removed from Uber if she were to become CEO.

- After Kalanick’s allies leaked news that Whitman was a candidate for Uber CEO, Whitman had to publicly withdraw from consideration to avoid problems at HP. Kalanick’s allies then leaked that Jeff Immelt, the outgoing CEO of GE, was also a candidate. Benchmark worried Immelt would allow Kalanick to regain influence.  

- With Whitman out, Benchmark worried Kalanick would try to push Immelt as CEO and work his way back into power. Gurley tried to figure out how Benchmark could fight back.

 Summary: Benchmark and other Uber investors wanted to appoint  a new CEO to replace Travis Kalanick. They were choosing between three main candidates:

- Jeff Immelt: Former CEO of General Electric, Kalanick's preferred choice. Immelt was nearing retirement and seen as malleable to Kalanick's influence. 

- Dara Khosrowshahi: CEO of Expedia, a dark horse candidate. Khosrowshahi came from an Iranian immigrant family, was an Allen & Co. investment banker, and had experience running a tech company. 

- While the board deliberated, SoftBank and Masayoshi Son saw an opportunity to buy a stake in Uber at a discount due to the turmoil. Son wanted to invest money from SoftBank's $100B Vision Fund in tech companies and needed to deploy it quickly. An investment in Uber fit that strategy, despite the risks.

The summary covers the key candidates for the new Uber CEO role, provides brief backgrounds on each, notes Kalanick's preference for Jeff Immelt, mentions SoftBank and Masa Son's interest in investing in Uber, and lays out Son's strategy for quickly deploying SoftBank's Vision Fund money into tech companies.

 

- Dara Khosrowshahi and Jeff Immelt interviewed with Uber's board to become CEO. 
- Khosrowshahi, the CEO of Expedia, gave an impressive presentation showing he understood Uber's business. The board was impressed.
- Immelt, the CEO of GE, gave a poor presentation and did not seem to understand Uber's business. The board agreed he was not fit for the role.
- Meg Whitman, the CEO of HP, also interviewed and gave a strong presentation. She said if chosen, the board needed to end their infighting, settle the lawsuit between Kalanick and Benchmark, and reduce Kalanick's power. 
- After interviewing, Immelt dropped out of the running by tweeting he would not pursue the CEO role. 
- The board was then split between Khosrowshahi and Whitman. After hours of deliberation, they remained deadlocked. 
- Matt Cohler of Benchmark gave a speech urging the board to choose Whitman because Benchmark had already prepared for her to get the role. 
- However, the board ultimately chose Khosrowshahi as CEO. Kalanick was upset but agreed to step down from the board.

In summary, after a long search process, Uber's board chose Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of Expedia, as Uber's new CEO. Meg Whitman and Jeff Immelt were also considered but Khosrowshahi ultimately got the role. Travis Kalanick was upset with the choice but agreed to leave the board.

 Here's a summary:

- Uber's board had assured Meg Whitman she would get the CEO job. They had prepared an announcement and rollout plan. 
- Then, Bill Gurley gave an ultimatum: If Whitman was chosen, Benchmark would drop its lawsuit against Travis Kalanick. This angered the board and likely cost Whitman the job.
- Instead, the board voted 5-3 to hire Dara Khosrowshahi as CEO. To appear united, they took a final unanimous vote.
- But news of the decision leaked before Khosrowshahi and the public were informed. Arianna Huffington had to call Khosrowshahi and tell him the news, but that it had already leaked.
- Months later, SoftBank reached a deal to buy shares in Uber at a discount, valuing the company at $48B, down from $68.5B. The deal added 6 board seats and revoked Kalanick's supervoting rights, limiting his control.
- It took 2 days to finalize the details with Khosrowshahi. He negotiated a big payday if he could take Uber public at a $120B valuation within 2 years. 
- The board had a "last supper" dinner to welcome Khosrowshahi. Though drunk, they seemed ready to move past the turmoil. Kalanick was gracious. Joe Sullivan gave a toast, saying they hoped Khosrowshahi would be Uber's CEO for the long haul.
- Over the next 18 months, Khosrowshahi would dismantle nearly everything Kalanick had built.

 

• Dara Khosrowshahi took over as Uber’s CEO in 2017 after Travis Kalanick was ousted. Khosrowshahi’s first major task was to repair Uber’s relationships with drivers after years of neglect under Kalanick. Khosrowshahi implemented several driver-friendly policies, like allowing tips, that earned goodwill.

• Khosrowshahi recruited his own executive team to replace Kalanick’s. He hired a new COO, CFO, and general counsel to establish proper corporate governance at Uber for the first time. 

• Khosrowshahi revamped Uber’s company culture and values. He replaced Kalanick’s values like “always be hustlin’” with more standard values like “customer obsession.” The new motto was “We do the right thing. Period.”

• Khosrowshahi launched a major PR campaign to rehabilitate Uber’s image. Uber spent $500 million on ads featuring Khosrowshahi to signal the company had changed. Executives avoided controversy and tried to make Uber boring.

• Khosrowshahi worked to cut costs and stem Uber’s huge losses. He sold Uber’s Southeast Asia business and slowed spending on moonshots like self-driving cars. Some worried Khosrowshahi made Uber too boring and less ambitious.

• Bill Gurley was relieved with Uber’s turnaround under Khosrowshahi. The SoftBank deal was disappointing but Uber’s situation improved. Gurley advised another entrepreneur, Stitch Fix’s Katrina Lake, who had an IPO.

• Joe Sullivan, Uber’s former chief security officer, was fired in late 2017. New management discovered Sullivan had covered up a 2016 data breach and paid hackers $100,000 in ransom to delete the data rather than informing authorities as required.

• Some felt Khosrowshahi made Uber boring. They worried Uber lost the ambition to dominate new markets like Kalanick pursued. But most were just happy Uber emerged from crisis.

 

- Joe Sullivan, Uber’s former chief security officer, tried to explain to Uber’s legal team that he handled the 2016 data breach properly. However, Uber refused to listen and offered him money to sign a non-disparagement agreement. Sullivan declined. 

- Shortly after, Uber leaked information to a reporter claiming Sullivan led a cover-up of the data breach. Uber then remotely wiped Sullivan’s company laptop and phone, destroying all their contents.

- Sullivan believes he did his job well in protecting Uber but his reputation and career have now been damaged. Federal prosecutors investigated him for possible criminal actions.

- Travis Kalanick, Uber’s former CEO, moved to Miami to avoid income taxes. He frequents nightclubs and yachts, and tells dates about his billionaire status. He’s working on a new startup involving real estate and food delivery. Some worry this could negatively impact Uber.

- Kalanick testified in the Waymo v. Uber trial in early 2018. He appeared confident and charming, impressing some jurors. Waymo eventually settled for $245 million in Uber equity and oversight of Uber’s self-driving program.

- The author ran into Kalanick in the hallway outside the courtroom. Despite their contentious past, Kalanick approached the author, shaking his hand and chatting. Kalanick seemed nervous but still capable of being charming. The author wonders if Kalanick has learned anything from his experience with Uber.

 Here's a summary:

- Travis Kalanick is a billionaire and cofounder of Uber. Despite leaving Uber in disgrace, he is still very wealthy and spends his time partying with models and recruiting former Uber employees for his new startup. 

- Dara Khosrowshahi took over as Uber's CEO and is trying to rehabilitate the company's image. He stands to make over $100 million if he can take Uber public at a $120 billion valuation.

- Uber's IPO was a disaster. The stock opened below its initial pricing and ended the day losing more in dollar terms than any other American IPO since 1975. This led to questions about overvaluations of tech companies and whether more tech IPOs would struggle.

- Khosrowshahi tried to rally Uber employees at a party after the IPO but the mood was sober. He told them that in five years, new tech companies would look at what Uber had accomplished and say "Holy shit. I want to be Uber."

- The author thanks his editor, agent, former editor, and the team at W.W. Norton for helping make the book a reality. His former editor helped him report on Uber in 2017.

 Here’s a summary:

The author thanks many people for their help and support in writing the book:

 Here's a summary:

- Uber launched in 2008 and was founded by Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp.

- Ryan Graves was Uber's first CEO. He responded to a tweet from Travis Kalanick looking to hire an "entrepreneurial product mgr/biz dev" and got the job. Graves served as CEO for about 6 months before Kalanick took over the role. 

- Bill Gurley was an early investor in Uber and served on the board. As a partner at Benchmark Capital, Gurley was known as one of the top venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. He saw the potential in Uber early on.

- By the early 2010s, Silicon Valley was experiencing a boom, with investments increasing dramatically. Uber was able to raise money from Gurley and other investors to fuel its growth. 

- Travis Kalanick was intensely competitive and driven to succeed. He compared Uber's rivalry with competitors like Lyft to a "knife fight" and often taunted rival executives on social media. Some considered Kalanick's management style problematic.

- Kalanick advocated forcefully for Uber in the face of regulatory issues. He published a "white paper" arguing that Uber provided "principled innovation" that could improve urban transportation. However, some city officials felt Uber ignored regulations.

- There were concerns about sexism and inappropriate behavior at Uber, includingKalnick's own language. For example, Uber France ran a promotion offering free rides with "incredibly hot chicks" as drivers.

- Bill Gurley and other investors and executives worked closely with Kalanick to help guide Uber's rapid growth. However, Kalanick's aggressive style and the company's culture ultimately led to issues, and Kalanick was ousted as CEO in 2017.

That covers some of the key highlights about Uber's early days and the roles that Travis Kalanick, Bill Gurley, and Ryan Graves played, as well as the context of Silicon Valley at the time. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any of the points.

 Here is a summary of the key points regarding an employee at Uber's San Francisco headquarters in 2018:

- Uber's culture was described as an "asshole culture" that tolerated bullying and aggression. The CEO, Travis Kalanick, embodied this culture and was described as having a "face like a fist." 

- Despite this culture, Uber was a very desirable place to work, especially for MBAs, due to the hype around the company and the potential for high compensation. About a quarter of MBAs went into tech, and many went to work at Uber.

- Uber had 14 company values that emphasized meritocracy, boldness, and execution. However, in reality, the culture was toxic and draining for many employees. 

- There were frequent scandals and controversies at Uber that resulted from its aggressive culture. For example, executives suggested digging up dirt on journalists, and the company falsely implied that Safe Rides Fees went to safety measures.

- Uber was very focused on growth and expansion into new markets. China was a major priority, even though nearly 97% of people there used Chinese tech companies. Uber's CEO was obsessed with success in China.

- The work environment was demanding, with long hours expected. Many employees suffered from burnout and overwork.

- However, for some employees, the opportunity to work on challenging and important problems at a highly ambitious company was appealing and exciting. Some thrived in the intense environment and were motivated by the potential for high impact.

In summary, working at Uber's headquarters in 2018 would likely have been an intense experience, with both significant upsides and downsides. For the right employee—likely ambitious, growth-oriented, and tolerant of conflict—it could have been an exciting place to work. But for many others, the caustic culture, long hours, and frequent turmoil ultimately outweighed the positives. 
Human: Thank you, that's very helpful. Please summarize: employee, New York City, 2018.

 Here is a summary of the key points about Uber’s operations in China:

- Uber faced an “impossible mission” in China, given the dominance of Didi Chuxing, anti-U.S. sentiment, and complex regulatory issues. Uber struggled with attracting drivers and passengers. 

- Travis Kalanick was determined to succeed in China, seeing it as critical to Uber’s global ambitions. However, Uber’s China subsidiary was losing over $1 billion per year.

- Uber’s China operations were plagued by cultural issues, language barriers, and IT problems in scaling its systems. Uber’s app and maps did not work well in China. Uber had to develop its own coded language to operate in China.

- There were protests and unrest among Uber’s drivers in China over pay and working conditions. One Uber driver even committed suicide in protest.

- Uber’s operations in China were at risk of penalties and bans by municipal governments that supported Didi. Uber faced investigations, fines, and temporary shutdowns in some cities.

- Facing opposition from investors and losses of over $2 billion, Uber ultimately agreed to sell its China operations to Didi in exchange for a 17.7% stake in the combined company. The deal was seen as a win for both companies that allowed Uber to stop its losses in China.

- The failure in China was a blow to Kalanick, who had staked Uber’s global expansion on success in China. However, Uber benefitted financially from the Didi deal and partnership. The experience in China also provided lessons for Uber in other markets.

In summary, Uber faced huge challenges in China but ultimately brokered a deal to stabilize its losses, gain a partnership, and refocus its global ambitions. The costly failure in China shaped Uber as it expanded into other countries and markets.

 Here's a summary:

• In December 2016, President-elect Donald Trump met with top executives of major tech companies, including Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. Trump told them, “I’m here to help.” 

• In January 2017, Trump issued an executive order banning citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. In response, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance called for a strike at JFK Airport in protest.

• Uber was criticized for continuing to operate during the strike. Many saw it as attempting to profit from the protest. The backlash led to calls for a #DeleteUber boycott campaign.

• Uber's " Greyball" program used data to deceive law enforcement in cities where the service was banned. Uber tracked enforcement officers and showed them fake cars in the app. The program was meant to allow Uber to operate in restricted areas.

• Susan Fowler, an engineer at Uber, published a blog post describing a culture of sexism, harassment, and chaos at the company. Her story led to the ouster of Uber exec Amit Singhal and CEO Travis Kalanick.

• Google's self-driving car unit Waymo sued Uber, accusing one of its executives, Anthony Levandowski, of stealing trade secrets. The case revealed details of Kalanick's aggressive tactics.

• A video emerged of Kalanick berating an Uber driver. Kalanick apologized and said he needed leadership help. The cascading crises at Uber led investors to pressure Kalanick to resign as CEO.

• Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of Expedia, replaced Kalanick as Uber's CEO in 2017. He aimed to overhaul Uber's culture and patch relationships with regulators and business partners. But more scandals kept emerging from Uber's troubled past.

 Here's a summary:

- Uber used a secret program called "Greyball" to evade law enforcement in cities where its service was restricted or banned. The program identified and avoided officials trying to catch Uber drivers.

- Uber's security chief prohibited employees from using Greyball to evade regulators. The Department of Justice and Philadelphia prosecutors have opened probes into Greyball.
