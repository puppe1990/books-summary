- The author struggled for a long time with feeling stressed, stuck and unhappy despite trying many self-help techniques. Nothing worked until he learned about energy cleansing and healing.

- Detoxing and mastering your energetic body is key to happiness, peace and fulfillment. Once the author learned this, his life improved dramatically. He became more confident, vibrant, loved and connected to God. He attracted better relationships and opportunities. Miracles and abundance became normal. 

- The author is from Manila, Philippines. He grew up in a Catholic family but Filipino culture is also very superstitious. His family engaged in spiritual practices outside of Catholicism.

- The author showed signs of being energetically sensitive from an early age. He had vivid dreams, saw spiritual beings and had out-of-body experiences. His family recognized he had a gift and encouraged him to develop it.

- The author's earliest memory of energy healing was at age 4 when he eased another child's stomach ache by placing his hands over her belly. His family praised him for this.

- The author believes God gives everyone gifts and a purpose for using them to serve others. But we must do energy cleansing to access these gifts and purpose.

- The author created an energy detox program to teach people to cleanse themselves energetically, discover their gifts and purpose, and use these to help others.

- The author believes God is an infinite source of energy, not an anthropomorphic figure. He believes we reincarnate many times to learn life lessons. Time as we know it does not really exist. We can access alternate timelines. 

- The author will refer to God, Source, the universe and other terms interchangeably. He will also refer to accessing one's "highest self." This is the wise, aware part of us that links the material and spiritual worlds.

- The author's sister created sacred geometry images in the book for protection, meditation and intention setting.

 

The author grew up in a Filipino family that held mystical and supernatural beliefs, despite nominally following Catholicism. Her grandfather channeled spirits, her parents had prophetic dreams and visions, and she herself showed signs of psychic abilities from a young age. However, these abilities also made her feel like an outcast and she tried to suppress them. 

When the author was 18, her family moved from the Philippines to the United States for better opportunities. She struggled to adapt to the new culture and make friends. She started an online dating advice business to earn money and meet people. She also began studying self-help books to try and improve her situation.

Two years later, the author spoke to a psychic named Christel on the recommendation of a coworker. Christel told the author that “energy blocks” in her chakras and aura were preventing her from achieving abundance and happiness. Christel introduced the author to a healer named Nick who could remove these blocks. The author was fascinated by Nick and his new age spiritual persona.

In summary, the author grew up surrounded by Filipino mysticism but struggled with her own psychic gifts. After moving to America, she turned to new age spiritual practices like chakra healing to try and overcome personal struggles, connect with her cultural roots, and find purpose and belonging.

 

- The author describes visiting an Australian spiritual healer named Nick who used crystals and made whooshing sounds to remove energetic blocks from her body. Though she felt calm, she didn’t notice any major changes. About a month later, she was offered an opportunity to speak at a conference that earned her more money in one day than she’d make in over a year. She attributed this to Nick’s healing work. 

- The author wanted to learn how to do healing work herself. She traveled to Sedona, Arizona, a spiritual hub, and hired a shaman tour guide. At the top of a vortex point, she had a powerful spiritual experience where painful emotions from her childhood surfaced. She released them into the earth. She then saw sacred geometry symbols and had visions. She believes this opened her third eye.

- After Sedona, the author started receiving spiritual downloads, visions, and synchronicities. She experimented with doing energy healing on herself, sensing blocks in her body and removing them. She asked God to fill the empty spaces with light.

- The author started doing readings and healings for others. She found she could sense information about people’s lives, health issues, relationships, and more. She realized she had developed intuitive and healing abilities.

- The author learned various healing techniques like cord cutting, chakra clearing, aura cleansing, and working with angels. She studied under mentors and read many books. She eventually started teaching others.

- The key message is that the author went on a journey to develop her intuitive and healing gifts through experiences, mentors, experimentation, and practice. She found she was able to help others in a meaningful way.

 

- The author started doing energy healing and clearing out energetic blockages in clients. This led to improved mental, emotional and physical well-being in clients. 

- Word spread and the author ended up doing over 10,000 free healing sessions over 10 years. The healings weren’t always pleasant and could lead to physical purging as the toxic energy was released. The author had to be careful to clear her own energy after sessions to avoid draining or becoming ill.

- When visiting family, the author’s sisters started exhibiting their own spiritual gifts, activated through the author’s energy and presence. This showed the author that in addition to healing, she could activate spiritual gifts in others.

- The author’s first marriage ended. Visiting Sedona to heal led to a purging of trapped emotions from her past and present. This allowed her to reconnect with herself. 

- Soon after, the author met her current wife, Mandy, who taught her to infuse more love into her healing work. Mandy inspired the author through her purpose-driven life and love for helping others. Mandy also helped the author strengthen her channeling abilities and gain permission to start practicing physical healing.

- In summary, the author discovered she had an ability for energy healing and clearing energetic blockages. She spent years honing her craft and helping others through free healing sessions. Meeting her current wife was a turning point that allowed the author to deepen her healing abilities and start practicing physical healing. Her wife’s inspiration and support helped the author continue progressing on her spiritual path.

 

• Energy detoxes clear energetic impediments and blocks that prevent clear energy from flowing freely through you. This allows you to activate your gifts and pursue your purpose work. 

• Energy blocks are like obstructions in a river that slow the flow of water. Detoxing removes these blocks and allows energy to flow unimpeded.

• Detoxing prevents harmful energies from taking root in your energy field. Without detoxing, these energies can grow into bigger issues and attract negative people and events into your life. 

• Detoxing reveals your spiritual gifts and life purpose. We are all born with supernatural abilities meant to benefit humanity. Accessing gifts on a lower frequency can lead to tapping into darker versions of your gifts.

• No two people have the same gift, and no gift is more important than another. Our gifts are meant to work together to help the collective energy.

• Detoxing allows you to remove energy troubles and feel like a new, excited person ready to share your gifts.

• In summary, detoxing provides total peace, purpose, and clarity by cleansing you of energies that slow down or stop your ability to thrive.

 

- Energy is fundamental to life and existence. Our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors influence our energetic frequency, which then shapes our lives and experiences. 

- High vibrational energy feels positive, light, and uplifting. Low vibrational energy feels negative, dense, and heavy. We want to aim for higher vibrations.

- Other people's energies and environments can influence our own energy. Clearing your energy helps prevent this and keeps you living at a high vibration.

- Energetic blocks form from accumulated low vibrational energy and negative beliefs, emotions, and conditions. They impede progress and require clearing. Blocks start in the auric field, then penetrate the chakras and physical body if left unaddressed.

- Clearing your blocks and energy has to happen in divine timing. While we work to clear them, God determines how much can be released at a time based on what is for the highest good. Progress may depend on learning lessons, frequency, or a divine timeline. 

- After clearing blocks and energy, you may experience miracles and feel better, even if the process is gradual. Everything unfolds as it should.

The goal is to clear your energy and blocks so you can live at a high vibration, make guided choices, use your gifts, fulfill your purpose, embody your authentic self, and thrive. Daily struggles will fall away and you'll encounter more positivity. Your clear vessel will allow positive energy to flow through you.

 

• Energetic blocks are stagnant or negative energies that accumulate in your auric field and physical body, impeding the flow of life force energy. They affect you physically, emotionally, and spiritually. 

• There are three main types of energetic blocks:

1. Traumatic Blocks: Formed from painful past events like abuse, loss, or bad relationships. They manifest as hurt, shame, anger, etc. and keep you stuck in negative patterns.

2. Environmental Blocks: Absorbed from your surroundings or other people. They come on suddenly and make you feel emotions that don’t seem to originate from you. Clearing them helps you and others function better.

3. Familial Blocks: Includes Generational Blocks passed down through DNA and Gestational Blocks formed in the womb. They perpetuate negative beliefs, emotions, and experiences over generations.

• Blocks are encouraged by both internal and external influences:

- Internal influences: Live inside you and are created by your thoughts, beliefs, emotions, experiences, etc. They are easier to recognize and change through awareness and energy work.

- External influences: Come from outside and are harder to control. They include environment, relationships, societal pressures, etc. Reducing exposure to them and maintaining strong boundaries can help minimize their impact.

• Becoming aware of what builds and amplifies your blocks is key to initiating an energetic shift. This can lift you into higher, more positive frequencies and encourage releasing the blocks. Energy work combined with emotional work is often needed for complete release.

• There are three categories of energy blocks that often need clearing: Traumatic, Environmental, and Familial (Generational and Gestational). Clearing them allows for optimal health, access to spiritual gifts, and alignment with your true nature.

 

• Internal influences that feed energy blocks come from within you and include emotional pain, negative relationships, poor choices, and trauma. Conquering internal blocks requires courage, honesty, and moving outside your comfort zone. External influences are outside your control and include negative interactions with others as well as environmental factors like pollution. Both internal and external influences often contribute to energy blocks. 

• Detoxing helps you access your spiritual gifts and life purpose. Your primary gift may emerge around day 5-7 of a detox. You may have vivid dreams, become empathic, feel heat in your hands (if a healer), or experience anxiety/headaches as your gifts surface. Your gifts have likely always been part of you but were dormant. Detoxing opens you to them.

• If you try accessing gifts before detoxing, the results may be negative. You’ll tune into lower frequencies. Detoxing clears your energy so you connect to higher entities and dimensions. Without detoxing, gifts can decrease, become blocked, or disappear if your ego gets involved. 

• Unexpected rewards from detoxing include enhanced intuition, guidance, and ease in decision making. You access higher realities and frequencies. Small, helpful life changes validate you’re on the right path. Your gifts simply enhance your life.

• A healer helped a detective access his gifts (intuition, clairaudience). The detective received a promotion and wrote a book about his journey. A client was haunted by dark entities until detoxing, then slept peacefully and had no more scary encounters. 

• Gifts can evolve, combine, and disappear. Detoxing aligns you but it’s easy to lose sight of the big picture. A healer’s confidence grew and she helped more people. Another’s energy and gifts decreased from negative experiences until detoxing again. The universe will turn off gifts if your ego gets involved.

The key points are that detoxing helps you access spiritual gifts and purpose, clears negative influences, opens you to higher guidance, and brings unexpected life benefits. But without detoxing, gifts may be dormant, negative, or lost. Ego and lower experiences can block gifts. Detoxing keeps your channel open.

 

The first three days of the energetic detox program focus on learning techniques to protect your energy from negative external influences. This is an important first step because negative energy from environmental factors, technology, and other people can feed energy blocks and impact your health and well-being. 

The three protection tools to try over the first three days are:

1. Intention - Set an intention to be protected from negative energy and experience positive energy. Recite the intention aloud in the morning and at other times when facing potentially draining situations. Pay attention to signs that the intention is working. Intentions can be timed for specific events.

2. Sacred geometry - Visualize protective geometric shapes like spheres, pyramids and cubes surrounding your body and energy field. The shapes filter out negative energy and amplify positive energy. 

3. Color and light therapy - Visualize a protective shield of white or golden light surrounding your body and energy field. The light acts as a filter, blocking negative energy and allowing in energy that resonates at a high, positive frequency.  

Trying different combinations of these techniques will help determine what works best for your personal protection needs. With regular practice of protection, you will gain confidence in facing negative energies and environments. Protection is key to maintaining energetic balance and well-being.

 

• Set a sincere intention statement to provide protection and guidance for the day. Focus on one intention to cover you for a difficult time. Intention statements imply you are co-creating with a higher power and trusting that power to fulfill your request. 

• Add sacred geometry, like pyramids, spheres and spirals, to strengthen your protection. Sacred geometry attaches spiritual meaning to geometric shapes and is found throughout nature and architecture. These shapes have been shown to have energetic and healing effects. Imagine yourself inside a sacred geometry shape. Play with the size and texture until it feels right.

• Use color and light therapy by setting an intention to find the right color for protection. Try gold, white, purple or green. Imagine the color streaming into your sacred geometry shape. Play with the color by making it lighter, darker, brighter or denser until it reaches maximum intensity. The color fills the shape and contains the energy.

• Combine intention statements, sacred geometry and color therapy for the most powerful protection. Keep tweaking these tools until you find what works for you.

 

• Creating a protective shield involves using intention, visualizing sacred geometry around you, and surrounding yourself in a color that makes you feel safe. This helps protect you from negative external energies.

• Finding the right combination of these techniques for you is personal and intuitive. You can be creative with the visualizations. Some people imagine flowers, stars or spinning bubbles of light. 

• As you start the detox process, you may experience physical, emotional or energetic side effects as energy moves through you. Grounding techniques like deep breathing can help stabilize the energy.

• The author's first experience with creating a shield changed her life. Before learning this, she felt overwhelmed by external energies and chaotic. Creating a shield gave her freedom and control over her own energy.

• As you build your shield, you'll start to notice shifts in the world around you and in your life. You may deal with emotional issues resurfacing or new opportunities arising. This indicates the universe is reshaping things around your new energy. Staying open to signs from the universe helps guide you.

• Creating an energy shield signals to the universe that you're ready to clear negative energy and elevate your vibration. The universe will start dropping more breadcrumbs to guide you on your path.

 

• Energy clearing removes negative energy that has attached itself to you from your environment, thoughts, and emotions. This energy can weigh you down and cause problems.

• The two main areas you'll focus on clearing are your auric field (the energetic field surrounding your body) and your chakras (the energy centers in your body). Clearing these areas will free your soul and allow you to reach your highest potential.

• You should do clearings in the morning after putting on your protection shield and at night before bed. You can also do impromptu clearings during the day if you feel intense negative energy.

• The clearing process has three main steps: clearing your auric field, clearing your chakras, and inviting authentic energy in to replace what you cleared. Practice the techniques on Days 4-6.

• After a clearing, you'll likely feel more at peace, confident, and relaxed. You may also experience positive life changes or events. Clearing your energy helps create space for good things to come in.

• Extend the clearing process to up to 3 additional days if you need more time to go deeper or rest. The goal is to be able to discern your own energy from the energy of others.

• Staying happy and calm will aid your clearing and healing. Let go of stress and negative emotions as much as possible.

 

- Marie saw her chiropractor even though she was low on money after paying off college loans.

- Her chiropractor was sympathetic and offered to treat her for free.

- It's a good idea to do impromptu energy clearing after emotionally triggering situations. The author used to do many clearings a day but realized it was attracting negative scenarios, so now limits it to 3 a day.

- A lot of energetic activity and clearing happens during sleep, so it's important to clear your energy in the morning. Negative thoughts and emotions before bed can cling to you and need clearing.

- The best way to clear energy is from the outside in: clear your auric field, then your chakras. Set an intention, imagine a vortex around you to release blocks and cords. Cut cords connecting you to hurtful people/memories. Fill in any energetic voids with a color like purple.

- Imagination plays an important role in energy clearing and spiritual practices. It taps into a supernatural reality and opens spiritual doors. With belief and faith, it produces miracles. Exercising your imagination strengthens your connection to the divine.

- To clear chakras, rub your hands to activate heat energy. Move hands over each chakra, noticing any intensity or ringing to indicate a blockage. Use colors, sacred geometry and intention to clear each chakra, starting with the crown and ending at the root.

- Chakras govern your spiritual, emotional and physical health. Clearing them restores balance and flow of energy through your body.

 

Your body contains energy centers called chakras that can become blocked over time. When chakras are blocked, you can experience physical, emotional, and spiritual distress. To clear your chakras, use your intuition to envision extracting the toxic energy in a way that feels right to you, such as:

•Visualizing your hand as a sword to cut out the negative energy

•Scooping out the energy with your hands like a shovel 

•Imagining the energy as weeds you are pulling out by the roots

•Picture the energy as a sticky goo you are removing

Once your chakras are cleared, fill them with divine light (white, purple or gold) and balance them to the size of a tennis ball. Get to know your seven major chakras by their locations, characteristics and how to recognize if they are blocked:

•Crown chakra: At the top of your head. Connects you to higher self and collective consciousness. Blockage causes disconnection from higher self.

•Third eye chakra: Middle of forehead. Intuition and higher knowing. Blockage impairs intuition and judgment. 

•Throat chakra: Center of throat. Communication and speaking truth. Blockage causes difficulty expressing yourself.  

•Heart chakra: Center of chest. Love and compassion. Blockage leads to anger, resentment and inability to give/receive love.

•Solar plexus chakra: Above belly button. Personal power and confidence. Blockage causes indecisiveness, control issues and unstable emotions.  

•Sacral chakra: Below belly button. Creativity and relationships. Blockage leads to lack of self-love, unhealthy boundaries and reproductive issues.

•Root chakra: Base of spine. Security, survival and basic needs. Blockage causes anxiety, poor boundaries, financial problems and lower body pain.

After clearing your chakras, ground yourself by walking barefoot, meditating, spending time in nature, doing yoga or Tai Chi. Grounding helps you integrate the energetic changes you have made.  Your intuition and inner guidance will show you the best ways to keep your energy clear and balanced.

 

• Grounding yourself after an energy clearing is important to avoid feeling ungrounded or "floaty".  Techniques for grounding include imagining tree roots extending from your feet into the ground, eating salty or earthy foods, walking barefoot.

• Quick energy clearing techniques for when you're in a pinch include: exercise like dancing or yoga; spending time in nature; using citrine or selenite crystals; burning incense or sage; reading, journaling or meditating; geometric breathing; and sending the person upsetting you off in a "love bubble".

• Negative feelings, thoughts, and behaviors can create energetic blocks and keep you stuck on a low frequency, attracting more negativity.  Clearing your energy field and chakras can help shift you to a higher frequency and more positive manifestations.

• look for signs from the universe like meaningful songs, number patterns, or animals crossing your path.  These indicate you're on the right path or receiving guidance.

• To fully heal, you must clear blocks at their root.  Left unaddressed, toxic emotions and energy blocks can become deeply lodged in your field and chakras, and even settle into your cells and soul.  Clearing layers of blocks can have a ripple effect, releasing other blocks at the same time.

• watch for signs your blocks are growing like spending time with unsatisfying friends or partners, lackluster new jobs or opportunities, feeling chronically sad or anxious, physical illness.  The original upsetting scenario has now created multiple layers of negativity in your life.

 Here is a summary of the scope covered so far:

- The concept of energetic blocks and how they negatively impact one's life by lowering one's vibration and ability to manifest desires and live purposefully. 

- Chakras as energetic centers in the body that can become blocked, and the importance of clearing them. Specific experiences, thoughts and emotions can block each chakra.

- The auric field as the energetic layer surrounding the physical body, and how it can also become blocked by negative experiences. Clearing the auric field allows one's vibration and energy to rise.

-The "secret sauce" for clearing energetic blocks, raising one's vibration and improving one's life is practicing techniques like meditation, affirmations, journaling, etc. 

- Raising one's vibration through maintaining an optimistic mindset and participating in enjoyable activities allows one to attract more positive experiences and opportunities. Staying in a high vibration state makes it easier to establish boundaries, manifest desires and live one's purpose.

- Examples of clients who were able to improve their lives by clearing energetic blocks, raising their vibration and sustaining it at a high level. For example, the story of Brenda who cleared a block in her heart chakra, improved her health, relationships and found a new job. And the story of Jan who raised her vibration and was able to establish boundaries with her judgmental sister.

- Upcoming chapters will cover discovering and practicing one's spiritual gifts, as well as living one's life purpose. Overall, the program aims to teach clients how to achieve an optimal energetic state and make the most of their lives.

Does this summary accurately reflect the scope of concepts and ideas covered in the passage? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

• Raise your vibration daily through exercises and activities that feel natural and invigorating to you. Build them into your routine at morning, night, and as needed. Find 3-5 options that work for you.

• The activities should feel instinctive, energizing and uplifting - not forced. They tap into your “natural wiring” and inner child. Options include nature, creativity, art, music, service, solitude. Emotional and intuitive activities are most effective.  

• The key is performing activities with the intention of raising your vibration for the highest good. Do them from an open heart and authentic place. How much they lift you depends on your emotional investment.

• Options include light/color therapy. Visualize divine light filling and lifting you. Follow it up as high as you can go, feel close to God. Breathe it in, hold and release. Drift back down like a feather, filled with the high vibration.

• For some, solitude and alone time is most recharging. It was for Gemma, the workshop attendee. After leaving early and isolating herself, her energy felt whole and at peace. She just needed to raise her vibe her own way.

• When your vibration is high, you’ll feel energized, uplifted, peaceful, connected. You’ll attract like-minded people and opportunities. Make the high vibration a habit and surround yourself with things that mirror and inspire it.

• If your vibe dips, re-center yourself with clearing work first. Then layer in vibration-raising activities to lift it back up and make the good feelings a habit again. Stay open to new practices as you grow; go-to exercises may change.

• The two emotional states for the highest vibration are unconditional love and gratitude. They keep fear at bay and open you to infinite possibilities. Make them a daily practice.

 

• Grounding yourself by visualizing roots growing from your feet into the earth will help stabilize your energy and vibration. This can prevent feelings of anxiety, inadequacy or being ungrounded.  

• As your vibration rises, your environment and relationships will shift to match it. You'll attract passion projects, like-minded people, and feel more comfortable being yourself. Hosting social events will feel easy. You'll feel at home in yourself and the world.

• Crystals can help raise and maintain your vibration, though you have the power to do so without them. Place them around your space or wear them. Certain crystals include:

- Smoky quartz and obsidian: Protect against negative energy 
- Citrine: Raises mood and energy
- Selenite: Activates and raises vibration, facilitates spiritual connection
- Amethyst: Opens intuition and crown chakra
- Rose quartz: Opens heart, facilitates self-love and relationships

• Compare how you feel now to before you began raising your vibration. Ask others if they've noticed a difference. Journal your progress and reflections.

• It's normal for your vibration to fluctuate. You can't avoid all low-vibration triggers. Respond to challenges with love, listening and boundaries. Start boundary conversations with "I love you, but..." to stay empowered. Give yourself grace when you overcorrect.

• Three signs your vibration is lowering:

1. Negative emotions like anxiety, fear or hopelessness. Process them, do an uplifting activity and determine their cause.

2. Attracting draining people. Set boundaries, imagine them in a bubble of love or do uplifting activities. Determine what attracts them and make changes.

3. Problems arising and bad luck. Do an uplifting activity and remember your inherent power. Consider the underlying cause. 

• Other signs include appliances breaking, family issues arising, or pets acting out of character. Make adjustments to raise your vibration.

 

- The author suggests trying a higher-self meditation when your energy needs a lift or you need insight into why it dipped. Connecting with your higher self, a version of your soul with higher wisdom and energy, can help raise your vibration and provide answers.  

- To access your higher self, get into a neutral state of mind. Then visualize a colored light filling you and follow it up into the sky, connecting with God's energy. Bask in this and gently come back down to earth. Ask your higher self for answers and it will provide them.

- The highest vibrations are love and surrender. Love comes in many forms like gratitude, empathy and connection. Surround yourself with loving people and opportunities. When the author works with unloving people, progress slows. She shares a story of a suicidal woman who healed just from experiencing the love at a workshop. Love opens your heart chakra, raises your vibration and allows intuition to flow.

- Surrender is giving yourself to a higher power and submitting to what holds you back. Realize you don't have all the answers and put the problem in God's hands. Set the intention for help and follow the signs that appear. It requires faith and waiting for direction. The author and her friend now try to surrender first before struggling on their own. Though emotions and need for control can interfere, their intention is to ask God for guidance and be open.

- In summary, love and surrender are high vibrational states that can lift you up or provide answers when needed. Connecting with your higher self and God's energy through visualization and meditation helps tap into these states. Letting go of control and handing problems over to a higher power leads to following divine guidance.

 

- Focus on discovering your primary spiritual gift during Days 10-12 of the detox. Continue with your regular practices to maintain high vibration. 

- On Day 10, review the 6 spiritual gifts and determine which one resonates most. Notice how you feel reading each description. Your gut will tell you which gift is right for you. If more than one gift calls to you, do the meditation to clarify.

- On Day 11, look at how your past has hinted at your gift. What activities or people have you been drawn to? What have you done that has used aspects of your gift? Have others complimented you for traits of your gift?

- On Day 12, rest. Determining your gifts can be emotionally draining. Take time to process what you've learned and let the information integrate. 

- Gifts can only be fully accessed and perform at their best on high vibration. At lower vibration, you can only use basic skills and connect with lower frequency energy. Raising your vibration allows your gift to unfold and be used for the highest good.

- Your gift is meant to be used to spread hope, mercy, faith, compassion and generosity. You have spiritual work to do on this planet by using your gifts to help others.

 

- Having a low vibration from drug use, negative emotions, etc. inhibits your spiritual gifts. Raising your energy and vibration activates your gifts. 

- Your spiritual gifts are meant to guide you to your purpose and best life. When you use them, your intuition strengthens and life improves.

- Once you determine your gifts, your mind will connect experiences from your past that relate to them. Your gifts are part of your soul and meant to be used, so ignoring them can cause health issues. 

- There are six main spiritual gifts:

1. Channels - Communicate with spiritual beings and receive divine messages to share with others. Quality of messages depends on your vibration. Channels bring enlightening info to the world. Examples: Aristotle, Einstein, writers.

2. Clairsentients - Sense energy and emotions. Feel others’ feelings in their body. Help others gain insight into emotions and energy blocks. Need to set boundaries and detach from others’ energies.

3. Empaths - Absorb others’ emotions and energies like a sponge. Help others by understanding them deeply and providing comfort. Need to limit stimuli, rest, meditate and set boundaries. 

4. Healers - Channel healing energy to restore health and balance in others. Can heal with touch, thoughts, or by clearing auras. Need to recharge and set boundaries to avoid fatigue and illness.

5. Intuitives - Receive intuitive insights, guidance and premonitions from spiritual realm. Help others gain clarity and direction. Need to differentiate between ego and intuition. Intuition strengthens with use.

6. Transmuters - Transform negative energies into positive ones. Transmute darkness into light through focused thought, visualization or touch. Need grounding, shielding and self-care to avoid absorbing negative energies. Help create positive change.

The key is using meditation to determine your primary gift(s) and then practicing it while establishing boundaries and self-care. Start with one gift before moving on to others. The process should feel natural, not forced. Your gifts are meant to be used to help others in a meaningful way.

 

• Leslie is a channeler who began speaking in an unusual language during a lecture. The language sounded like dolphin sounds and she was channeling a hidden archangel. Channelers can access high vibrational beings but must share the messages they receive to feel balanced. Signs you might be a channeler include liking solitude, craving sugar, having excess energy, and seeming wise for your age.

• Transmuters cleanse negative energy for others. They absorb the energy and cleanse it, helping others feel better but making the transmuter feel drained. Transmuters are sensitive, empathetic, and often feel overwhelmed. They need a lot of self-care and cleansing. Signs you might be a transmuter include people feeling better around you, being sought out for advice, feeling drained after conversations, and being exhausted in crowded places. 

• Psychics tap into energetic frequencies and have a “sense of knowing” that gives them insight. They may have prophetic dreams and visions. Psychics can help in many ways, from solving crimes to helping businesses. In a class of psychics, students shared visions, finished each other’s sentences, recognized each other from dreams, connected with spiritual realms, saw auras and spirits, and witnessed symbolic transformations. Psychics need to establish boundaries and share the information they receive. Signs you might be psychic include experiencing déjà vu, knowing things without being told, and intuiting information from touching people.

The key points are that these are three types of intuitive or spiritually gifted people: channelers, transmuters, and psychics. Channelers receive and share messages from spiritual beings. Transmuters absorb and cleanse negative energy from others. Psychics tap into intuitive knowledge and may receive prophetic information. People with these gifts need to practice self-care to stay balanced and healthy.

 

- You have strong intuitive senses and perceive information beyond the physical through your gifts. You receive spiritual knowledge through extrasensory perceptions. 

- Your dreams often reflect real events or carry symbolic messages. Recurring dreams or precognitive dreams that come to pass in waking life indicate you have a strong connection between the conscious and unconscious mind.

- Hands-on healers have an innate ability to sense energetic imbalances in others and restore wellbeing through touch or at a distance. They intuitively know how to relieve physical, emotional and mental distress. Many have personal experiences of healing from health issues, giving them insight into the healing process. They must protect their own energy when working with clients.

- Akashic records readers can access a metaphysical compendium of all knowledge and life events. They perceive information about a person’s soul, life plan, past lives, future probabilities, and spiritual journey. Readings provide guidance and insight for growth and direction. Readers must have strong psychic protection and discernment.

The key attributes for these gifts are:

- Strong intuition and ability to sense information beyond the physical senses
- Dream recall and interpretation 
- Compassion, empathy and desire to ease suffering
- Mystical or esoteric interests
- Life experiences that cultivate insight and wisdom
- Well-developed psychic protection and spiritual discernment

The summary outlines the main points about sensing spiritual information, prophetic or meaningful dreams, hands-on healing gifts and reading the Akashic records. The attributes required to develop and use these gifts in a balanced way are also noted. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 Here is a summary of the key points about Akashic Records:

• The Akashic Records are a vibrational field that contains all information about every soul across time, space, and dimension. They hold records of your soul’s purpose, past lives, life lessons, soul connections, and more. 

• The records are guarded by spirit guides and can only be accessed by those with pure hearts and minds. Information is revealed as needed and for the highest good.

• Those who can access the Akashic Records tend to be analytical, curious, and seekers of knowledge. They often feel they have a deeper life purpose to guide others. 

• Akashic Records readers provide guidance on life lessons, soul missions, and karmic issues—not day-to-day life matters. The information taps into a higher universal truth.

• Some people, like Tiffanie, use the Akashic Records to create products and services that provide healing and insight for others. The records guide which ingredients or tools will most benefit each person.

• Signs you may be an Akashic Records reader include “just knowing” things, being told you have a big heart and mind, loving to learn, and being good at trivia. 

• Weather and electronics manipulation is an extremely rare gift, affecting only about 5-7% of people. Signs include the weather changing based on your mood, electronics malfunctioning in your presence, and major life shifts coinciding with technology issues.

• To determine your primary gift, do an intuitive exercise like the one described using deep breathing, intention setting, visualizing light, rubbing your hands to build energy, and feeling for the gift choice that feels most magnetic or tingly. Your hands can guide you to the right choice.

• It’s normal for using your gifts again after a detox to feel uncomfortable at first. But trust that you are worthy and meant to use your gifts to serve in a meaningful way. Feel relieved and seen in discovering your true purpose.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the chapter:

1. Days 13-15 are focused on practicing your spiritual gifts and purpose work. After the detox, your energy will flow freely and your gifts will operate at their highest potential.

2. Purpose work involves using your gifts to serve others. It should be a central focus of your life and help keep your energy and frequency high. 

3. As you practice your gifts and purpose work, your life will change. Relationships and situations that don’t match your high vibration will fade away. This is part of the process of aligning your life to your gifts.

4. Look for patterns and signs from the universe pointing to limiting beliefs you need to clear. Resolving these will raise your frequency and strengthen your gifts.

5. Lead with love. Serve others from your heart chakra. This will benefit recipients, develop your gifts, prevent fatigue, and raise the collective energy.

6. Continue your morning, night, and afternoon routines to stay centered and high-vibing. Adjust as needed to maximize their effects. These practices are now part of your identity.

7. On Day 13, journal to clarify your energetic goals. Consider how life was before the detox and how you want it to be now. Make lists of what drags you down and lifts you up to see your growth.

8. Life will not always be perfect. When your energy dips, re-center yourself with cleansing exercises. Your chart will help get you back to a high vibration.

9. Your gifts and purpose work should bring you joy. Appreciate the journey of growth and co-creating with the universe.

Examples of purpose work in action:

•A dentist used her gift as a transmuter to calm patients.
•A stay-at-home mom accessed the Akashic Records to help her children.
•A channel and projector worked with her motivational speaker husband.

The key is to start small, gain experience, listen to your intuition, and allow your gift and purpose to evolve over time. What matters most is using your high vibration to serve others in a way that fulfills you.

 

- A person's life purpose is often tied to important lessons they need to learn or painful experiences they want to heal from. Serving others in a way that helps them work through similar struggles can be deeply fulfilling. 

- The main point of purpose work is service. It's meant to fulfill you while also helping others and making a positive impact on the world. Even small acts of kindness and generosity can serve others. 

- It's important to keep a lighthearted and joyful approach to your purpose work. Maintaining a high vibration will help you stay open to guidance and new opportunities. Expressing gratitude, love, curiosity and playfulness can help elevate your energy. Continuously clearing old blocks and healing from challenges will prevent your vibration from dropping.

- Be careful not to let ego get in the way of your purpose work. Stay humble and focused on selfless service. Your gifts and abilities are meant to help others, not feed your ego or desires for status.  

- Spread the blessings you've gained from growth and purpose work. Share your story and inspire others. Know that the light within you can overcome any darkness. You have unlimited potential to find happiness and bring joy to the world.

- You're not alone. Connecting with like-minded people who share your gifts and desire to serve can help you feel supported in living your purpose.
