Peg saw an opportunity to start a furniture delivery business. She called it Sven Delivers, in honor of IKEA's Swedish roots. She designed a website, marketed on social media, and bought a used van. The business took off, with customers appreciating the affordable delivery option. Peg now makes nearly $2,000 a month, has increased trips to IKEA, and offers assembly for an extra fee. She provides great customer service through communication and her website. Peg spends a few hours each week on the business in addition to her full-time job. The success has given her confidence to start other side hustles. 

A key factor in the success was identifying a need - affordable IKEA delivery - and providing a solution. With experience in logistics, Peg executed well.

 

- Brian Thompson is a copywriter from Austin, Texas. In 2014, he launched a website offering to turn people's tweets into physical art as an April Fool's joke. Unexpectedly, the site took off and he started making several hundred dollars a week. He eventually invested in his own laser engraving machine and expanded into doing larger orders for corporate events. Over four years later, he's still operating the project part-time and making at least $10,000 per year from it. 

- David Gaylord and Tim Burns are two friends from Ottawa, Canada. Tim discovered that using beard oil in his pubic area helped reduce irritation and discomfort. They realized this could be an opportunity and began developing their own pubic oil products. Despite skepticism from friends and family, they persisted and eventually launched Bush Balm. They started selling the oil online, gaining customers through word-of-mouth and press coverage. They've reinvested their income back into the business and are now running ads, reaching out to retail partners, and continuing to grow.

- The key factors in both stories are noticing an opportunity where others didn't, persisting despite doubts and obstacles, starting small to test the idea, and reinvesting and expanding over time as the idea proves viable. With creativity and determination, both pairs of entrepreneurs were able to build successful side hustles from ideas that began as jokes.

Jeremy Enns was working as a landscaper but wanted to start a side hustle doing something he enjoyed more. He had gone to school for audio engineering and loved listening to podcasts, so he decided to start editing and producing podcasts. Jeremy reached out to friends with podcasts to learn the workflow, did freelance work for a podcast production company, and emailed 100 podcasts to try and land new clients. He also found work through Upwork. Within 3 months, he was making enough to quit his landscaping job. After 6 months, he was making $4,000/month.

The key points for these side hustles are:

- Do something you have a passion for and skills in 
- Start with low costs and keep things simple 
- Market to your existing network and look for new clients through platforms like Upwork
- Once you have enough consistent income, you can consider quitting your full-time job
- Reinvest in the business to help it grow by improving your website, using tools to streamline processes, etc. 
- Look for ways to expand by selling in new places, creating new products, subscriptions, etc.

 Here's a summary of the side hustle:

- Bry Larrea, based in Washington, DC, started a side gig writing personalized letters from Santa Claus during Christmas season. 
- She got the idea out of boredom and a need to make extra money. Her initial attempts at selling the letters were unsuccessful until she improved the quality and offered reindeer food.
- In the first year, she sold 300 letters at $9.95 each and made $4,000. In the second year, she outsourced some of the writing and sold 400 letters, making slightly less profit. 
- In the third year, she raised prices, did little marketing, sold 250 letters and made $6,000. 
- This is a seasonal side hustle, operating for about a month around Christmas time each year. 
- The key to success was providing a high-quality, personalized product and the reindeer food option which appealed to customers.

The critical factors in the success of this side hustle are:

1) Tapping into a niche market (personalized Santa letters) during peak season (Christmas)
2) Improving the quality and personalization of the product 
3) Offering an appealing add-on (reindeer food)
4) Outsourcing part of the work to increase profit margins
5) Raising prices over time as the product and demand grew

 

For a small amount of work once a year, a woman named Bry earns a good income by writing and sending personalized letters from Santa Claus to children. She receives thank you letters and photos from kids and parents in return, which is fulfilling. The key lessons from her story are:

1. Identify an opportunity to create a pleasant surprise for parents and children. It doesn't have to be seasonal like Santa letters—you could do letters from the tooth fairy, for example. 

2. Consider parents' needs and allow them to review the letters before sending. Parents are the actual customers, so address their concerns.

3. Create a personal touch, like the reindeer food, that helps you stand out and provides an upsell opportunity. 

4. Use free or low-cost marketing, tapping into your networks to spread the word.

The critical factor in her success was offering an impulse purchase at a low price, with the reindeer food providing an easy upsell.

Bry's sales increased when she added the option for parents to approve the letters first. This reassured them that they wouldn't be responsible for any promises "Santa" made without their knowledge.

With minimal work for a short time each year, Bry earns $2,000/month through this seasonal side hustle. The personalization and customer delight generate goodwill, word-of-mouth marketing, and repeat customers.

 

- Lisa Holtby started a home organizing business in Seattle. 
- She charges $65/hour with a 3-hour minimum. In the first year, she earned $3,000/month, increasing to $4,000/month.
- She donates unwanted items from her clients to local refugees. She's able to help refugees get items they need like cribs, diapers, clothes, etc.

- Nicole Buergers founded a beekeeping and honey business in Houston called Bee2Bee Honey Collective. 
- There were no beekeeping services in Houston before. Beekeeping helps the environment through pollination and honey production.
- Nicole started with $5,000 of her own money and raised $13,500 on Indiegogo.
- She charges $600 for a new hive and starter bees. She also charges monthly fees to maintain the hives. She takes 35% of the honey produced. 
- Nicole sells honey to local retailers, in a "Honey of the Month" club, and at events. She earns over $7,000/month during high season. 
- In addition to the honey business, Nicole rents out a room on Airbnb, helps a friend with a tabletop game, and does events for a local cheese shop.

- The key factor in both stories is finding a way to earn money from skills and interests they already had. For Lisa, it was home organizing. For Nicole, it was beekeeping and honey. By turning hobbies and skills into side hustles, they were able to generate thousands per month in extra income.

 Here is a summary:

Nicole's story of becoming a beekeeper serves as inspiration. Despite initial challenges, she pursued an unusual need she identified and turned it into a successful business. By continuously improving her skills and sharing her knowledge with others, she built expertise and a community. Though unpredictable at times, as evidenced by the swarm of bees that escaped during a client meeting, her passion for the work fuels her persistence. 

Key lessons from Nicole's journey:

1. Identify an underserved need and learn the necessary skills to meet it. 
2. Share your story to raise awareness, funds, and support. 
3. Look for ways to apply your skills, like finding landowners to allow you to place beehives on their property.
4. Turn your passion into profit by selling products or services, like Nicole's honey.

The critical factor in Nicole's success was recognizing Houston's lack of a well-organized beekeeping service and her willingness to invest in establishing one. With hard work and persistence, she turned her vision into a reality.

Adam enjoys gardening and has a collection of plants, bonsai trees, and other treasures. During his teenage years, while researching how to care for his plants, Adam discovered terrariums - small glass enclosures used to display plants. Although terrariums were not very popular at the time, Adam was intrigued by them. 

A few years ago, Adam graduated with a master's degree but was unable to find work in his field. During this time, he decided to make his own terrarium using the Tiffany glass technique. His friends were impressed and encouraged him to sell his creations online. Adam posted one on Etsy and soon received his first order from a customer in the U.S. He began investing in more materials and tools and created a website to sell his terrariums.

Adam's terrariums are handmade and soldered, rather than mass produced, so he is able to charge slightly higher prices, ranging from $45 to $115. Although Adam now has a full-time job, he continues to work on his business, Geodesium, in his spare time. So far, he has sold over 100 terrariums and earns about $830 per month. He has also expanded into selling terrarium kits, which require less time to make and have become his bestselling items. Adam hopes to start selling at local craft markets in the future.

Adam says getting started on Etsy is simple if you take high quality photos and create an interesting story for your shop. Although he enjoys making terrariums, he recommends choosing a product that is less labor-intensive. Adam's most expensive terrarium contained 80 pieces of glass and sold for $174. His passion for plants and skill with crafts have allowed him to turn his hobby into a successful side business.

Nathan and Kathrin Spaccarelli decided they wanted a different life that allowed them to travel more with their family. After taking a yearlong sabbatical to travel the world, they returned determined to find a way to combine their entrepreneurial skills and love of travel. 

They settled on starting an importing and reselling business that could operate remotely so they could be location independent. They began by reselling water filters on Amazon's Fulfillment by Amazon program but soon discovered ceramic-coated cookware from Italy that they thought would have more potential.

They imported 1,500 units of the pans from the Italian manufacturer and launched their brand, DaTerra Cucina.  The pans were a hit, quickly rising to the top of Amazon's rankings and earning rave reviews from customers. In their first year, they made over $200,000 in sales and were able to put $40,000 into their family travel fund.

In their second year, they made $85,000 in the first quarter alone, allowing them to invest in more stock and add new products.  Nathan attributes their success to being "fanatical" about the quality of the products they sell.  They strive to provide a great experience for their customers, which has led to highly positive reviews and repeat customers.

The business has already been very profitable, though it's unclear if it will eventually replace their original coffee distribution company.  Either way, the Spaccarellis have achieved their goal of finding a way to continue traveling the world as a family while earning an income.

 Here is a summary:

Nathan and Kathrin launched an e-commerce website selling cookware. At first, they only sold 1-2 items per day but sales grew quickly. They were dedicated to providing great customer service which led to many positive reviews and new customers. They experimented with different products before finding success with cookware.

Brittany Finkle started Happily Ever Borrowed, a company that rents high-end accessories to brides. The idea came from her experience planning her sisters’ weddings and seeing how expensive accessories were. She used her experience in the fashion industry to source high-quality products at good prices. The company has doubled sales each year and now generates over $80,000 per year in revenue. 

Rene Delgado runs BounceHouseStore.com, a company that sells and rents bounce houses and other inflatables. He analyzed over 100 potential products to sell before landing on bounce houses. He built a website and established relationships with manufacturers to dropship the products. In the first year, the company generated over $300,000 in sales. The business is highly seasonal, so he started another dropshipping business selling indoor golf equipment to balance out the revenue streams.

Tim Haren is a high school student who started a business selling autographed sports memorabilia, primarily baseballs. He attended fan fests and spring training to get the autographs in person. He also built relationships with private signing agents to source additional inventory. In the first 3 years, he earned over $30,000. Despite his age, he showed a lot of business savvy in how he kept costs low, managed inventory and customer service well, and continued improving operations.

The key factors in their success were:

- Finding a niche market with little competition 
- Providing great customer service and building loyalty
- Controlling costs and managing operations efficiently
- Continuously improving and adapting to challenges
- Leveraging connections and experiences to source inventory

They were all able to launch and scale successful businesses by thinking creatively, working hard, and persevering in the face of obstacles. With the rise of ecommerce, there are many opportunities for imaginative entrepreneurs to build thriving companies.

 Here's a summary of the costs and income for this sports memorabilia side hustle:

Costs:
- Minimal. The business owner, Tim, buys baseballs and other memorabilia in bulk at low cost. 

Income: 
- Tim made $10,000 in profit in his first 90 days.
- He sells items on eBay, Facebook Marketplace, and Instagram.
- Prices for signed baseballs and other gear range from $20 to $500+ depending on the player.
- Tim's goal is to sign exclusive memorabilia deals with up-and-coming baseball players which could generate $5,000 to $50,000 per deal.

Website:
- Tim promotes his business on Instagram at @baltimoregraphs.

The key factors in Tim's success are:
- His knowledge of baseball and ability to spot up-and-coming players. 
- Finding other ways to source memorabilia at below-market prices (e.g. buying from less savvy collectors).
- Selling on platforms popular with sports memorabilia collectors like eBay and Instagram. 
- Keeping costs low by buying supplies in bulk.

The potential to make $10,000+ in profit within the first few months and the opportunity to sign exclusive deals worth $5,000-$50,000 show this could be a very lucrative side hustle, especially if Tim is able to continue sourcing memorabilia at good prices and spots players who end up becoming stars. The risk is that if Tim's predictions about up-and-coming players don't pan out or if the popularity of baseball declines, sales and profits could drop. But so far, Tim seems to have found a winning formula.

 

Marcus Kusi was a college student with a family to support. He needed a way to make extra money. He decided to start a reselling business, buying and selling college textbooks. 

He started with only $20 in startup funds, buying two used textbooks on eBay and reselling them on Amazon for a profit of around $50. He reinvested the profits to buy more textbooks.

In his first year, Marcus made $20,000. In his second year, he made $48,000, for a total of nearly $70,000 in two years. He sold over 5,000 used textbooks.

Marcus was able to buy textbooks cheaply from students selling their used books. He looked for books with high demand and sales rankings on Amazon. He often made direct cash offers to students selling on eBay to get the books at a good price.

The side hustle allowed Marcus to pay his bills, build an emergency fund, and support his family. He eventually stopped selling textbooks when he graduated and got a full-time job. But he used the profits and experience to start another side hustle, a blog and podcast for newlyweds.

The keys to Marcus's success were:

1. Choosing a product with high demand and consistent buyers (college textbooks)
2. Becoming very knowledgeable about the product 
3. Buying at low prices by making direct offers to motivated student sellers
4. Reselling on a platform like Amazon where he could set and control the prices
5. Reinvesting profits to scale and grow the business

This story shows how you can turn a small initial investment into a successful side hustle by choosing the right market and product and executing well. With hard work and perseverance, Marcus was able to build a $70,000 business in just two years.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

3. Begin experimenting by buying a few items at a 
time, listing them for resale, and paying attention 
to what works and what doesn’t. (For best results,
do more of what works.)

4. Increase your average selling price by providing
impeccable service. This will generate positive
reviews, which in turn creates trust from buyers.

Jodi Carlson earned money on the side by creating resources for Girl Scout troop leaders. She started a website and wrote an ebook which she sold for $5. The ebook and website ended up generating $3,000/month. 

To start her side hustle, Jodi invested $16. She focused on a topic she was passionate about, identified a need, and provided a simple solution at a low cost. She started small by writing one ebook, then grew from there based on feedback and interest. 

Key factors in her success were:
- Choosing a topic she cared about (Girl Scouts)
- Identifying a specific need (resources for troop leaders)
- Starting with a simple solution (one ebook)
- Providing great service and value 
- Growing over time based on feedback

Some actions you can take to get started with a side hustle:
1. Select a topic you care about that solves a need
2. Start with a simple solution (product, service, content)
3. Promote to your network and encourage word-of-mouth sharing 
4. Provide great service and value
5. Grow and improve over time based on feedback

 Here is a summary:

Jodi started a side hustle called Leader Connecting Leaders to help Girl Scout troop leaders. She had very low startup costs of only $16 for a domain name since she already had access to free hosting and design software through her full-time job. 

To drive traffic to her site, Jodi posted images on Pinterest which generated visits for months. She also used social media like Facebook to run contests and promote her business. While most of the information on her site was free, she charged $3 to $5 for some specific resources like activity booklets to generate $3,000 to $3,500 per month in revenue.

Two keys to Jodi's success were automation and an email list. She spent only 4 hours a month scheduling social media posts and sending emails to build trust with readers and promote new products. By understanding the challenges of troop leaders from her 25 years of experience, Jodi created products to solve their problems. She received feedback showing she helped leaders around the country.

Jodi now wants to start another side hustle. She said "I've tried many different things that have completely failed, but if I hadn't tried, I would have never known." A fun fact is that Jodi's mom was her troop leader and they turned their whole basement into the troop headquarters.

The critical factor in Jodi's success was that no one knew the needs of Girl Scout leaders like her. By providing many free resources, she built trust and leaders then bought her inexpensive but helpful products, generating real income for Jodi.

Bringing people together through shared interests and experiences is a powerful way to earn money on the side. You can produce events, tours, leagues, and more by identifying what people want to do and organizing it.

 

- Jesse, a community college professor, came up with the idea of starting a competitive karaoke league while drunk one night. When he sobered up, he still thought it was a good idea. He wanted to do something creative outside of his day job. 

- Jesse launched District Karaoke, a sports-style karaoke league where teams compete against each other. Participants and spectators vote on the winners using a web app.

- District Karaoke was quickly able to fill its spots and has since expanded to 48 teams across 3 seasons per year. It brings in $90K in revenue and $45K in profit each year through registration fees, bar payments, and sponsorships.

- Jesse started with low costs by using outside DJs but invested $20K to gain more control. He relies on word-of-mouth and engages volunteers to help run the league. His goal was to build community. 

- District Karaoke has now expanded to 4 other cities. Members have sung over 10,000 songs in competitions. Jesse has been able to get a new job and save money thanks to the side hustle. He also met his fiancée while hosting a District Karaoke event.

- Key takeaway: "In a community-building enterprise, involve more people earlier. My community members are my best salespeople.They know what needs to be fixed or changed, and what needs to stay the same."

- Alexandra Kenin, a project manager in San Francisco, started Urban Hiker SF, leading hiking tours in lesser-visited parts of the city. She offers public and private tours, including dating hike events with Match.com.

- Key takeaway: "Anyone who lives in a city could create a tour business. It costs virtually nothing to start! All I spend on each hiking tour is my time, and the income is almost all profit."

- James Hookway, an accountant in Perth, Australia, came up with the idea for a "morning after" party cleanup service while hungover after hosting a Christmas party. Not wanting to clean up himself, he thought of a service to do it for others and bring them breakfast in bed.

 Here is a summary:

- James came up with the idea for a hangover cleaning service called Hangover Helpers after a big party. He tested the concept by creating a Facebook page, which got a huge response. 

- Within two weeks, he was getting national media attention and his first customer. He then built a proper website and brand for the business.

- Over two years, Hangover Helpers performed over 250 cleanings and earned $45,000, all through word of mouth and social media. James hopes to expand nationally and eventually work on the business full time.

- The key to his success was finding a niche market and developing a memorable business strategy. Capturing attention quickly with a clear message about what you do is important.

- Alexandra Booze and her friend Karen started a food and lifestyle blog called East Coast Contessas, posting photos of their meals in New York City. They offered free social media campaigns and reviews to build their audience.

- In their second year, they made $15,000. In the first half of their third year, over $17,000. They branched into hotels and tourism. Alex now works with 450 brands, even as she moved to Prague for a new job.

- Their advice is to be open to working with smaller brands. Do research to craft engaging stories and figure out how to work together. Everyone starts somewhere, and smaller brands can still produce quality ideas.

- An action plan includes: Identify your goal and strategy for working with brands. Build the project frugally. Offer free work to build your audience. Research brands thoroughly to pitch them effectively. Be flexible in working with different kinds of brands.

 

• Jordan Crowler was working as an art director for a major corporation in Dallas. He wanted to move with his family to 30A, a beach area in Florida's panhandle. 

• Not knowing anyone in the new area and needing to support his family, Jordan didn't tell his employer he was moving. He knew layoffs were coming at his company.

• Once in 30A, Jordan looked for new opportunities. He noticed most people got around by bike, skateboard or walking since parking was difficult.

• Watching a Macklemore music video, Jordan saw the rapper riding an old-school scooter. This sparked Jordan's nostalgia for the scooter he had as a kid.

• Jordan researched scooters but found modern ones weren't as good as he remembered. Then he found Kickbike, a company that makes recreational scooters that combine the best of scooters and bikes. Though popular in Europe, Kickbikes weren't common in the U.S.

• Jordan contacted the owner of Kickbike America, who lived in Florida. Jordan proposed a trade: he would revamp Kickbike's website and marketing in exchange for Kickbikes and a commission on sales.

• The owner agreed. Jordan launched guided Kickbike tours on 30A, charging $25-$50 per person. The tours were a hit, and Jordan made $50,000 in the first year.

• Jordan has since moved on to other pursuits but still credits Kickbike for giving him the opportunity to build a successful hustle in a new place. The experience showed him he could create his own opportunities.

The key factors in Jordan's success were:

• Identifying an unmet demand (for recreational scooter tours) in his new location. 

• Finding an existing product (Kickbikes) that could meet that demand in an innovative new way. 

• Leveraging his skills (in web design and marketing) to negotiate an opportunity with the product's company.

• Taking initiative to create a guided tour business around the product that became very successful.

 Here is a summary of online Kickbike sales in the United States:

- Jordan discovered Kickbikes, a popular scooter brand in Europe, on a trip abroad. He saw an opportunity to bring them to the U.S. market. 

- After moving to Florida, Jordan imported 25 Kickbikes to start his business. He had difficulty finding retail space, so he operated out of his truck and left bikes around town with promotional flyers.

- Jordan created customized tours of the local area using the Kickbikes. He tailored the tours based on customers' fitness levels. The most popular tours became the focus of the business. 

- Jordan developed relationships with local businesses that allowed him to use their spaces as starting points for tours. This allowed him to avoid paying for retail space.

- The Kickbike tours and rentals brought in $3,000 to $5,000 per month in additional income for Jordan. He left his remote job to focus on the business full time.

- Jordan is now considering expanding into new markets and transitioning the business focus to Kickbike fitness classes which require less time than the tours.

- The Kickbike brand was largely unknown in the U.S. before Jordan brought it to Florida. Through strategic marketing and high quality service, Jordan successfully introduced the Kickbike craze to tourists and locals.

- Jordan's success demonstrates how an entrepreneurial spirit and passion for a product can lead to a prosperous business, even in a niche market. Jordan's flexibility, local knowledge, and customer service orientation were key to overcoming obstacles like lack of retail space and building a strong customer base.

The key factors in the success and growth of Jordan's Kickbike business were:

1. Identifying an opportunity to bring an innovative European product to the U.S. market. 
2. Leveraging his in-depth local knowledge to create unique tour experiences for customers. 
3. Building strong relationships with local businesses to overcome the lack of retail space.
4. Tailoring products and services to meet customers' needs and interests.

- Erika Kerekes is a food blogger from Santa Monica, California. 
- After picking too many cherries with her kids one summer, she experimented making cherry ketchup. Her family and friends loved it.
- She decided to turn the recipes into a business. She worked with a food chemist to develop commercial formulas and found a copacker to produce them.
- She named the product "Not Ketchup" and designed branding. She obtained proper insurance and certifications. 
- Her initial production run of 60 cases and three flavors cost $15,000. She now makes $5,000 a month selling the product.
- Erika was diagnosed with diabetes, so she wanted to create sugar-free alternatives to ketchup. Not Ketchup is made from natural ingredients like cherries, beets, and turmeric. 
- She started selling on her own website and on Amazon, then got into stores like Erewhon and Bristol Farms. She continues to get new accounts and has been featured in health and wellness media.
- Erika's advice is to start with your "why" for motivation, choose a memorable brand name, focus on high-quality ingredients, and start selling and building as you go. Consistency and persistence have been key to her success.

The key factors in Erika's success were:

1) Identifying an opportunity based on her personal needs and experiences. Her diabetes diagnosis and excess cherries sparked the idea.  
2) Developing a product that filled a niche for natural, sugar-free condiment options. 
3) Validating the idea by getting feedback from friends and family. 
4) Doing the necessary work to scale a home recipe and turn it into a viable commercial product. 
5) Starting to sell right away and learning as she went, rather than waiting to have everything perfect. Consistency and persistence built momentum.
6) Choosing a memorable brand name and high-quality ingredients to differentiate her product.
7) Selling online and in natural markets where her target customers shopped. Gaining press mentions and new accounts over time.

 Here is a summary:

Erika is a writer who started a side hustle making fruit-based condiments called Not Ketchup. She gave away samples to food bloggers and at a trade show, which led to getting into local stores and then larger retailers like Whole Foods and Sam’s Club. 

After two years, Erika was diagnosed with diabetes. She realized she needed to cut out added sugar, so she reformulated her products to have no added sugar. Her first no-sugar flavor instantly became the best seller. She raised $15,000 on PieShell, a crowdfunding site, to help with the transition to sugar-free products.

Erika then focused her marketing on customers with specialized diets like paleo, Whole30, and diabetic. Her sales increased, and she recently had her biggest month ever. Though the business is growing, Erika wants to keep it as a side hustle. She works on it in her spare time, like when doing chores or packing lunches.

The key factor in Erika’s success was switching to a sugar-free product line. By narrowing her target audience, she increased her sales. Though it was a huge transition, the change allowed her to market to audiences with specific dietary needs.

Gianluca De Stefano and Gavin Kamara work in finance but started a sock company called Gorilla Socks as a side hustle. While bike riding, Gavin learned about bamboo fibers and thought they would work well for socks. They wanted to create fashionable, eco-friendly bamboo socks and partner with a charity. They chose the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, which protects gorilla habitats.

After launching Gorilla Socks, they struggled with marketing at first, making mistakes like paying for ads that generated little benefit. They then targeted their marketing to their ideal customers and improved their storytelling about their cause. Four months in, they had made $10,000 in profit and donated to the Gorilla Fund multiple times. Gorilla Socks shows how a side hustle can be motivated by passion for a good cause.

 Here's a summary of endangered species:

• Endangered species are plant and animal species that are in danger of becoming extinct. There are many factors that contribute to a species becoming endangered including habitat loss and degradation, poaching, climate change, pollution, etc. 

• Once a species is listed as endangered, conservation efforts aim to protect and restore the species. This often involves protecting habitat, restricting hunting/poaching, captive breeding programs, and public education. 

• Some well-known examples of endangered species include:

- Giant panda: Found in China, less than 2,000 left in the wild. 

- Black rhino: Poached for its horn, less than 5,500 left.

- Sea turtles: Threatened by habitat loss, fishing gear entanglements, and poaching. 

- Blue whale: Less than 10% of the population left after extensive whaling. Now protected but recovery is slow.

- Orangutan: Found in Borneo and Sumatra, habitat loss is the main threat. Around 100,000 left.

- African elephant: Poached for ivory tusks, population declined by 62% over last decade. Around 415,000 left. 

- Hawksbill sea turtle: Poached for shell, around 15,000 nesting females left. 

- Gray whale: Commercial whaling decimated populations but now protected and population rebounded to around 26,000. 

- Bengal tiger: Poached for fur and other body parts, only around 2,500 left in the wild. 

• Protecting endangered species and their habitats is crucial to maintaining biodiversity on the planet. Many conservation organizations work to protect endangered species through policy changes, habitat protection, breeding programs, anti-poaching efforts, and raising public awareness.

Zach and Teddy are cousins who started a catering and food truck business in rural Pennsylvania. When Teddy was under house arrest, they started hosting dinner parties for friends and family. This led them to catering a wedding for 85 people, then launching a food truck and restaurant. In year three, they generated $235,000 in sales but expanding too quickly proved challenging. They had to take loans from their fathers and faced issues like local restaurants trying to shut them down. They realized their catering was the most profitable part of the business, so they went back to the drawing board to determine their next steps.

Emily Rudnick turned an eighth grade school project into an actual spice business called RudSpice. She worked with her father and local experts to create spice blends, eventually developing a blend that was suitable and affordable to produce and sell.

Her goal is to get RudSpice into restaurants, farmers markets, and retail stores as a replacement for salt and pepper.

The key factors in these entrepreneurs’ success were:

 Here is a summary:

Mike Bracciale came up with the idea for a concentrated, portable mouthwash after an awkward experience in college where he lacked fresh breath. He spent years developing the product and getting feedback. He teamed up with his fraternity brother Nick Telford, who helped with financing and branding. 

After months of testing different formulas, they developed a concentrated mouthwash that could provide 60 uses from a small 1.62 ounce bottle. They called it Fly Mouthwash, aiming to transform oral care by making it accessible on-the-go. 

They invested $20,000 to manufacture 7,000 bottles to start. They priced each bottle at $10, with each bottle providing 60 uses (16 cents per use).

In the first 6 weeks, they sold 1,400 bottles, making $35,000 in revenue. They started by selling on Amazon but then built their own website to collect customer data and run their own ads.

In the following months, they shifted to a subscription model, offering a “Fresh Breath Club.” 50 people signed up in the first weekend. For every individual sale, they now get 5 new monthly subscribers.

Fly Mouthwash partners with Water.org, donating to provide safe drinking water for 1 person for 1 month for every bottle sold.

They’re now looking to replace traditional mouthwash entirely, marketing the product as more than just portable.

In summary, two recent college graduates invented a concentrated mouthwash, invested in manufacturing and marketing, and built a successful subscription business and partnership that is transforming the oral care industry.
