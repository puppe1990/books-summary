 

- People tend to favor and value things that are connected to themselves in some way (their name, birthday, group, etc.). This is known as implicit egoism.
- Companies and organizations often take advantage of this tendency by linking their products or brands to customers in ways that create a sense of connection. For example, Coca-Cola printed common first names on its packaging, boosting sales. 
- The sense of connection can extend to one's social groups, not just oneself. For example, South Korean negotiators were able to secure the release of hostages from the Taliban by having a negotiator who spoke Pashtun, the native language of the Taliban. 
- Things that are easy to process, such as easy to pronounce names or rhyming phrases, are also favored and considered more valid. For example, attorneys and companies with easy to pronounce names tend to be more successful. 
- There are ways to exert control over these associative processes by choosing environments or cues that activate specific associations. The author describes setting up his work environment in a way that provided reminders and inspiration for his writing.

In summary, certain psychological tendencies, like implicit egoism, cause people to favor and believe in things that somehow feel connected or familiar to them. These tendencies can be leveraged for persuasive purposes, but people can also choose to manage the associations that influence them actively.

 

The author discovered that the location he wrote in significantly impacted what he produced. When he wrote at home, the work was better suited for a general audience. When he wrote at the university, the result was more technical and academic, suited for professionals in his field. This was because the environments provided different cues that shaped his thoughts and writing. His home environment, with more general and everyday signals, prompted him to think of and register for a broad audience. WithWith is more academic alerts initiated a literary style of thinking and writing.  

Realizing this, the author revised his work in his university office to match the style he wrote at home. He concluded that we could arrange our environments to provide the cues that will prompt our desired ways of thinking. Consultants found that meeting in glass-walled conference rooms led to better programs. Even when they couldn't choose the space, they found a solution: they put up posters of the relevant employees to provide exposure to the right cues.

We have two ways to provide ourselves with sound cues: we can alter our external environments or activate relevant inner states. Our inner experiences—thoughts, feelings, memories—can be started by features in our external settings. Creating an internal state makes us more likely to focus on it, see it as necessary, assign it causal power, and act on it. For example, coughing in audiences can spread by activation and contagion. When one person coughs, it activates thoughts of coughing in others, leading them to cough. This can happen for a variety of symptoms and in a variety of settings. Our inner states powerfully shape how we think, feel, and act. We can positively impact our thoughts and behaviors by choosing environments and experiences that activate the internal states we want.

 

• There are many examples of mass psychogenic illnesses in which people develop real physiological symptoms in response to perceived threats that are nonexistent or overblown. For instance, in one case residents of a Tennessee town flooded hospitals certain that they had been bitten by insects, even though the number of people who were bitten turned out to be 4,000% less than those who reported symptoms. 

• In another example, citizens of two Canadian towns reported escalating health problems after learning that cancer rates in their area were higher than usual. However, it turned out that the reported increase in cancer rates was due to a statistical error.

• The examples show how susceptible humans are to the power of suggestion and the influence of perceived threats. In one study, audience members developed skin irritations after listening to a lecture on skin conditions, demonstrating how the mind can create physical symptoms.

• The implications are that people can influence themselves positively and negatively based on where they focus their attention. Just as focusing on the symptoms of a disease can make people perceive that they have the disease, focusing on positive experiences and emotions can make people feel happier and more optimistic.

• Research shows that older adults tend to feel happier than younger people, even as their health and abilities decline. This is because older people focus their limited time on positive experiences that uplift their mood, rather than on the many negative aspects of aging. Older people can feel happier by managing their attention and concentrating on the positive.

• Anyone can achieve greater happiness and life satisfaction by following evidence-based practices from positive psychologists. The top recommendations are: count your blessings, cultivate optimism, practice acts of kindness, take care of your health and relationships, and savor life's pleasures and moments. By focusing on these positive behaviors and experiences, people of all ages can achieve meaningful increases in happiness and well-being.

 

The school district needs to show progress in readiness of female students for STEM careers to have a chance at winning a federal grant. The superintendent is worried because there has been no increase in math scores for female students on standardized tests. The standard testing procedures involve:

1. Separating students into rooms based on the first letter of their last name. 
2. Having teachers monitor the exam chosen by lottery.
3. Having students prepare for 10 minutes before the exam. 
4. Requiring students to provide name, ID, and gender at the start of the exam.

These practices should be avoided because there is a stereotype that women are not as good at math. Anything drawing attention to this belief before the exam can:

- Increase anxiety and make it harder to remember what they know 
- Distract from the actual test questions, causing them to miss information
- Lead them to attribute struggles to a personal deficit rather than problem difficulty, causing them to give up 

All four routine procedures are likely to intensify the adverse effects of this stereotype. The superintendent should change test administration to avoid highlighting gender and mitigate anxiety. This could increase scores and the chance of winning the grant.

In summary, the key points are:

1) There is a stereotype that negatively impacts women in math. 
2) Normal testing procedures draw attention to gender and increase anxiety.
3) This leads to lower performance through increased anxiety, distraction, and attribution of struggles to personal deficits.
4) Changes should be made to avoid highlighting gender and reduce anxiety. 
5) This could raise scores and increase the chance of winning the grant.

 

The studies show that directing initial attention to certain concepts can significantly influence people's subsequent thoughts and behaviors. This is because the human mind is primed and ready to activate related ideas and responses once a concept is brought to mind. The mechanisms behind pre-suasion are: 

1. Accessibility: When we focus on a particular concept, closely related concepts become more accessible and elevated in our consciousness. This makes us more likely to direct our attention and respond to these related concepts. Unrelated concepts become temporarily suppressed.

2. Readiness: Our mental activity is not just reactive but proactive. Concepts and responses fire not just when they are ready but when they have been readied by prior attention. The mind primes itself with what it has just been focused on.

3. Speed: This process happens quickly and automatically. Studies show that even infants and young children are subject to these effects. Exposure to images of togetherness, for example, spontaneously increased helpfulness in 18-month-old children. 

4. Duration: These priming effects can last beyond immediate exposure. Playing prosocial video games, for example, has been shown to increase helpful behaviors well after the competition has ended. The accessible associations planted in our minds continue to orient us for some time.

In summary, the mental mechanisms behind pre-suasion are based on the accessibility and readiness of associations in our minds. By strategically focusing initial attention, communicators can activate networks of closely related concepts and responses that powerfully orient thinking and behavior. This primitive process begins early and operates quickly, spontaneously, and enduringly.

 

- Pre-suasive processes are limited in scope. The strength of the effect depends on the degree of association between the initial concept and the subsequent concept. The stronger the association, the stronger the pre-suasive effect. 

- An experiment on reducing littering showed this. Focusing people on the anti-littering norm was most effective. Focusing them on more distant bars (e.g. recycling, energy conservation) could have been more effective.

- One approach to creating pre-suasive associations is finding existing solid connections between concepts. Another method is constructing links from scratch, as advertisers do. Simply pairing ideas in ads, like celebrities and products, can create relationships and influence people.

- Studies show we are susceptible to these manufactured pairings, even without awareness. Pairing images of a beer brand with pleasant activities increased positive feelings toward the beer. Pairing a mouthwash brand with nature scenes increased favorability. Pairing a soft drink with happy faces increased consumption and willingness to pay.

- "If/when-then" plans can help overcome the difficulties of achieving goals and acting on intentions. They prepare us to notice cues for action and automatically associate those cues with the intended action. Simply stating a purpose or making an action plan is less effective. 

- "If/when-then" plans defeat the usual obstacles to goal achievement. The sequencing specifies a time/circumstance to notice and directly connects that to the desired action. The plans are self-tailored. Studies show they are superior for improving weight loss, medication adherence, employment history completion, and more.

 

- Pre-suasion involves installing heightened vigilance for specific cues and associating those cues with a goal. This can make the plan more accessible and likely to influence behavior.

- Certain concepts and goals have already been primed to influence us, like hyperlinks on a website readily. These prefetched sources can be launched into action with a single reminder cue. If-when-then plans utilize this by associating signals with goals to make them more likely. 

- We are susceptible to influences from subtle environmental cues, like a catchy slogan or sunny weather. But we can correct for these biases by recognizing them. Being reminded of the potential for bias, like asking about the weather, can eliminate its effects.

- Product placements in media are meant to create associations between brands and likable characters or situations. While more prominent posts lead to greater recognition and recall, they can backfire by cueing the viewer to the persuasive intent. This can make people less likely to choose that brand. Subtlety and stealth are more effective.

- In summary, we must be vigilant for the potential impacts of pre-suasive cues around us and our automatic associations. But we can also install corrective mechanisms to avoid unwanted influence, like recognizing persuasive intent. A balance of cueing beneficial associations and correcting unwanted ones allows us to navigate a world full of persuasion.

 

The study found that people can correct potential biases and distortions when reminded of them. For example, when viewers were exposed to overly prominent product placements, only 27% chose those products. But when product placements were more subtle, 47% chose those products. 

People can neutralize the influence of psychological tendencies like choosing familiar or attractively presented options by deliberative reasoning. But deliberative reasoning requires time, energy, and motivation. When those are lacking, people resort to shortcuts that can lead to poor decisions.

Several conditions prevent people from recognizing and correcting foolish tendencies:

- Fatigue: Exhausted people can less resist emotional triggers and think critically. Studies show that fatigued combat units and interrogation subjects are more susceptible to poor judgment. 

- Time constraints: When rushed, people rely on a single shortcut factor rather than assessing all aspects. A study showed subjects chose an inferior camera when only given 2 seconds to determine options but chose a superior camera when given unlimited time.  

- Information overload: The amount and complexity of information today and technology disruptions undermine reasoned thinking. Communicators can exploit this by pre-suasively focusing audience attention, since audiences rarely have time for thorough analysis.

The most effective pre-suasions focus audience attention on concepts associated explicitly with the communicator's goal. Depending on the destination, the right approach could be:

- Exposure to a large number (to increase perceptions of expense)
- French background music (to increase choice of French wine)  
- An adventurousness question (to increase product trial)
- A scary movie (to increase the choice of popular items)
- A hot drink (to increase warmth toward the communicator) 
- Images of people standing close (to increase helpfulness)
- An image of a winning runner (to increase achievement orientation)
- An image of The Thinker (to increase careful thinking)

The overarching goal of persuasion is to gain permission. Are there concepts generally associated with the agreement that could be used as broad pre-suasions? The following chapters explore seven such ideas.

 

The six significant principles of influence that can generate agreement are:

1. Reciprocity: People tend to return favors and give benefits to those who have given benefits to them. This tendency is seen in all cultures and children as young as two. Requesters can tap into this principle by giving meaningful, unexpected, and customized gifts and favor before making a request. This approach is more effective than offering benefits only after a fulfilled request. 

2. Liking: People say yes to those they like. Physical attractiveness, similarity, compliments, cooperation, and association can all increase liking.

3. Social Proof: People look to what others do or think in uncertain situations to guide their thoughts and behaviors. When they see that others like or are engaging in something, they view it as more correct and appropriate.

4. Authority: People tend to follow the lead of credible experts. Titles, credentials, experience, and trappings of authority can all enhance someone's power and influence.

5. Scarcity: The more scarce and less available something is, the more people want it. Insufficient benefits and opportunities seem more valuable.

6. Consistency: People feel pressure to remain consistent once they decide or commit to an opinion or behavior. They can be influenced by reminding them of their past decisions and commitments.

By highlighting these six principles before delivering a persuasive message, communicators can make audiences more receptive to their argument or request. The principles represent psychological forces that strongly sway people toward acceptance and agreement.

 Here's a summary:

- People are more inclined to do things that they see others doing, especially if they are similar. This is known as the principle of social proof.

- Social proof operates through two mechanisms: validity and feasibility. Seeing others do something makes that action seem morally right (fact) and practically wise (feasibility). 

- The frequency of an action elevates judgments of its moral correctness. For example, learning that most peers support torture made people more accepting of it. Learning most try to overcome stereotypes made people more resistant to stereotypes.

- Social proof also reduces uncertainty about what is pragmatically right by using the crowd's wisdom as a proxy. People usually follow the lead of similar others.

- The power of social proof means that simple, low-cost solutions can influence behavior. Labeling dishes as "most popular" increased their restaurant selection by 13-20%. They say that most students eat fruit to be healthy and increase school fruit intake by 35%.

- Social proof can supplement or replace expensive influence techniques like upgrading ingredients, staff, or advertising. It taps into people's tendency to look to others, especially similar others, to determine appropriate thoughts, feelings, and actions.

 

The costs of complying with environmental regulations can often exceed the fines for violations. However, some countries have developed cost-effective programs by using social proof—publicizing the ecological ratings of polluting companies to encourage improvements. Studies show that social proof messages can be much more effective than messages emphasizing the environment, social responsibility, or financial savings. For example, in one study, a social proof message generated 3.5 times more energy conservation than other messages. 

While utility companies are often skeptical of such findings, social proof works well because it shows people that a behavior is feasible and realistic by demonstrating that others are already doing it. In addition to social proof, communicator authority is very persuasive. When experts speak, people tend to follow their advice without much scrutiny. This is especially true when people are uncertain. Neuroscience studies show that people follow expert advice by activating parts of the brain to understand others' intentions, rather than carefully evaluating the direction.

The most persuasive authorities are credible—they are both expert and trustworthy. Trustworthiness is one of the most essential qualities for persuasion. While it usually takes time to establish, it is possible to gain instant reliability by acknowledging a weakness in your position early on. Doing so makes you seem more honest, so when you discuss strengths, the audience will find you more credible and believable. Studies show this strategy to be effective in legal settings, politics, and advertising. Using words like "however" and "yet" to transition from a weakness to a strength can make this technique even more powerful.

Historical examples include Queen Elizabeth I of England, who gained her troops' trust by acknowledging her weak woman's body but proclaiming to have the heart of a king. Despite their misgivings, she later gained Parliament's trust by stating that though they had wiser rulers, none would love them better. Her speeches were extremely persuasive and memorable.

 

The six principles of influence—reciprocity, scarcity, authority, consistency, liking, and social proof—are universal. They transcend culture, gender, age, and other variables. Once accepted, they disarmed even wary opponents. This is because the principles fit with research showing that starting with a weakness before stating a strength is most effective when the power challenges the relevance of the fault. 

For example, Queen Elizabeth I did not say her troops would love her but assured them she had the "heart of a king." Scarcity, the desire for less available things, is powerful. For instance, Crumbs cupcakes sold for $250 each after the shops closed. Losing something of value motivates us. As a CEO said, a millionaire will act to avoid losing $20,000 but not to gain the same amount.

Restricting access increases an item's worth. Prayer reduced infidelity as it was inconsistent with wishing the partner well. We want to seem consistent with our statements and actions. Small initial steps prompt bigger ones. Reminding people of existing commitments works, too—an honesty pledge on forms reduced lying. Voting in one election increased voting in the next. We were recommending a brand that led to greater loyalty. Saying "We'll mark you as coming, okay?" raised event attendance.

The campaign for marriage equality targeted Anthony Kennedy. It used concepts from his prior opinions like "dignity," "liberty," and "rights" to associate his views with their position. During hearings, arguments echoed this. Kennedy's opinions relied on these concepts, suggesting the tactic worked.

The principles' effectiveness depends on the relationship stage—initially, reciprocity and liking to build rapport. Giving, finding common ground, and compliments help. Next, reducing uncertainty is critical. Authority, social proof, and scarcity address this. People follow experts, the crowd, and want scarce opportunities. Finally, gaining commitment to change is essential. Consistency and absence, by highlighting potential loss, are helpful here. The core motives model outlines how the principles align with relationship stages.

 

The passage discusses the discovery of a seventh universal principle of influence called unity. The author recognized this principle after reflecting on an anecdote of a student who exchanged holiday cards for ten years with strangers due to the principle of reciprocity. However, the strangers' decision to host the student's son did not fit the exchange. The author realized that the relationship built over the ten years led to the favor, not the need to reciprocate. 

Unity refers to shared identities and relationships that make people feel like they are "of" each other rather than just "like" each other. These relationships maximize favorable treatment between people. The two categories of factors that create unity are:

1) Being together: 
- Kinship: People are particularly willing to help close genetic relatives. This is due to "inclusive fitness" - assisting related others in helping copies of one's genes. People get rewards in their brain from helping families.
- Physical proximity: Nearness leads to perceived unity and willingness to help. This is why neighbors tend to help each other. 
- Familiarity: Repeated exposure to someone leads to perceived unity. This is why interacting with someone more leads to liking them more. 
- Sharing difficult experiences: Going through challenges together leads to unity. This is why fraternities haze new members - to build unity through shared hardship.

2) Acting together: Shared goals, cooperation, and interdependence also build unity. The passage will explore this category in the next chapter.

In summary, the principle of unity highlights the power of human relationships and connections to motivate change. Fostering a shared identity and purpose can make people more open to influence.

 

The author offered extra credit on a test to students whose parents responded to a questionnaire. The response rate was 97%. The author believes offering the same deal to grandparents would have produced an even higher response rate, possibly 162 out of 163. 

The author discusses how individuals can employ the concept of kinship to gain favor from others, even without a genetic connection. Collectives that refer to members with familial labels like "brothers" or "sisterhood" can increase members' willingness to sacrifice for the group. Studies show that reminding Spaniards of their national "family" increased their desire to fight and die for Spain.

The author discusses Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway as an example. Buffett is renowned for his investing success and communication skill. In Berkshire Hathaway's 50th-anniversary shareholder letter, Buffett had to argue for the company's continuing success after his eventual departure. 

Buffett began by admitting he couldn't have accurately predicted the last 50 years. He then said he would advise shareholders as he would his own family. This framing made his subsequent arguments for Berkshire Hathaway's future success more convincing to the author, who has owned Berkshire stock for years. The author sees this as an example of Buffett's skill with pre-suasion or framing messages to gain receptiveness.

Though commentators praised the letter's arguments, none noted Buffett's subtle familial framing. The author says this shows how even genuinely trustworthy communicators can employ pre-suasion to gain trust and receptiveness. The author notes that kinship cues beyond direct family ties can create a sense of identity merger and lead to pre-suasion. Buffett's letter illustrates how the "merger of self and other" can become an essential persuasive message.

 

Physical similarity and geographic proximity are cues that people use to determine genetic relatedness and kinship with others. Within families, individuals tend to help those who resemble them. Outside of families, people also use facial similarity to judge how closely related strangers are to them, and they tend to favor those who look more similar. People can even be manipulated into selecting others more if their faces are digitally altered to appear more similar.  

Proximity, or being from the same place, is another cue of genetic relatedness that impacts behavior. For example, people tend to view and treat those who grew up in the same home as kin, mainly if they lived together for a long time or saw their parents caring for them. As a result, children exposed to a range of people in the home may be more willing to help strangers.

The actions of Chiune Sugihara, a Japanese diplomat, illustrate how these factors can motivate altruism. Although Sugihara's career ambitions and responsibilities to his government argued against it, he risked everything to help thousands of Jews escape Europe during WWII. His willingness to defy orders and do so may have stemmed from seeing his parents open their home to diverse guests as a child. For Sugihara, the Jews' humanity and need for help mattered more than their nationality or religion.  

 Localism, or favoring those nearby, is another influence. People tend to favor and cooperate with those in their neighborhood or community. Two examples from the Holocaust show how powerful localism can be. In one town, neighbors helped hide a Jewish girl for years, even though doing so put them at risk. In another city, neighbors refused to allow a Jewish man in need and reported him to the police, leading to his death. Overall, while cues of kinship can motivate altruism, they can also drive discrimination against those seen as outsiders.

 

The Holocaust shows how a shared sense of identity and unity can lead to harmful and helpful outcomes. Leonard Cohen described an incident where a Nazi concentration camp guard spared the life of a prisoner from his hometown, showing mercy due to their shared identity. On the other hand, rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust were often motivated to help after requests from people with whom they shared their identities, like neighbors or relatives. 

Feelings of unity based on a shared region or geography can also motivate people. Sports fans feel a sense of pride in their local team's victories. Studies show people are more willing to participate in surveys or oppose wars when the subjects are from their region. During World War II, Japan resisted Nazi pressure to persecute Jews in Japanese territory, possibly because Jewish leaders argued that Jews and Japanese shared an identity as Asians, unlike the Nazis.

Acting in synchrony or collaboration can also create feelings of unity. A professor from Soviet-controlled Poland described how choreographed celebratory events made people feel emotionally uplifted and validated, with a sense of "all for one, and one for all." Though the events supported an oppressive regime, they effectively fostered feelings of group cohesion.

In summary, identities and experiences of unity - based on family, place, or shared action - can have significant psychological and behavioral effects for both good and ill. They motivate people to show favoritism or harm towards the in-group but also inspire acts of compassion, cooperation, and moral courage.

 

- Engaging in synchronized experiences with others, such as singing, dancing, or chanting, evokes feelings of unity and group cohesion that have been crucial for human cooperation since prehistoric times. 
- Acting in synchrony with others leads people to feel more similar to and liking of one another. This can include synchronous movements, sounds, or sensations. For example, stroking someone's face in synchrony with a video of a stranger's face being stroked led viewers to rate themselves and the stranger as more alike. 
- The unity and liking generated by synchrony can motivate self-sacrifice and support. People who tapped a table synchronously with a stranger were more willing to stay late to help the stranger with an uphill task. Teammates who marched in synchrony were more cooperative in a game that required sacrificing personal gain.
- Music is a compelling means of producing synchrony and its social outcomes. A study found that 4-year-old children who sang and moved in synchrony with music were more helpful to others compared to children who did not have the musical experience. 
- In summary, synchronous experiences, especially musical ones, can evoke feelings of unity, bonding, and social cohesion that motivate people to become more helpful, cooperative, and self-sacrificing. These effects have been instrumental to human cooperation throughout our history.

The key ideas are:

1) Synchrony → unity/bonding 
2) Unity/bonding → liking/support 
3) Music is especially effective for producing synchrony and associated outcomes

 

- A study found that children who engaged in synchronized movement and music with a partner were more than three times as likely to help their partner as those who did not share that experience. 

- This helping behavior was self-sacrificial, requiring the helper to give up their playtime. This shows how powerful joint music and movement can be in influencing behavior, even in typically selfish children.

- The helping behavior was spontaneous and intuitive, not based on rational reasoning. This shows how influencing people's emotional, System 1 thinking can produce powerful effects.

- Communicators can use emotional, System 1 appeal like music when audiences are in an emotional mindset or for emotional goals. Rational, System 2 magnets like facts should be used when audiences reason or have pragmatic goals.

- reciprocity and personal disclosure can create closeness and unity between people. An experiment by Aron and Aron used 36 increasingly personal questions to produce feelings of intimacy and love between strangers in just 45 minutes. Hundreds of studies have confirmed this effect.

- The implications are that we can influence people through synchronized experiences, intuitive/emotional thinking, and the reciprocity principle by increasing personal self-disclosure between people. Matching the system of thinking to people's mindsets and goals is critical for maximizing persuasion.

 Here are two critical aspects of the effectiveness of co-creation:

1. The activity escalates into personal disclosure. This causes participants to open up to one another increasingly trustingly, similar to close relationships. 

2. The interaction is synchronous and coordinated. Participants respond to one another in a back-and-forth manner, making the experience continuously collaborative.

These aspects can lead to several benefits:

- People tend to feel a special connection to things they help create. This is known as the Ikea effect. Co-creation may produce a similar effect, causing people to feel connected to their co-creators.

- Co-creation can reduce biases and conflicts between groups when people work together in a coordinated fashion, as in cooperative learning exercises, tendencies toward in-group favoritism decrease. 

- Companies can build brand loyalty through co-creation. By inviting customers to collaborate on new products and services, companies can make them feel more connected to the brand. However, framing the collaboration as the customers providing advice rather than opinions or expectations is essential. Advice puts people in a mindset of merging with the other party, fostering unity. Beliefs and expectations do the opposite.

- Asking for advice, even from superiors, can effectively build unity and support. While it may seem risky to ask a boss for advice, doing so makes makes the boss feel more connected and supportive of the person asking. The advised person is seen as more competent and confidence-inspiring.

In summary, co-creation that involves escalating self-disclosure and coordinated interaction leads to beneficial outcomes like increased liking, support, cooperation, and brand loyalty. Framing collaboration as advice-seeking rather than opinion-giving amplifies these effects.

 

The author acknowledges that revealing influence techniques could be misused by unethical practitioners to deceive consumers. The author could counter this concern in the past by arguing that 1) the book provided information to help consumers recognize and reject unwanted influence and 2) the tactics revealed were already known and used by many influence professionals. 

However, with this current work on pre-suasion, those defenses need to apply. The book focuses on how to employ influence effectively rather than defeat it. And the practice of pre-suasion is not widely used, so the author is revealing new tactics, not just describing existing ones.

To address ethical concerns, the author argues that deceptive business practices severely damage a company's reputation and trust, harming its finances and success. Although such tactics may boost profits temporarily, the long-term costs to reputation and trust outweigh any short-term gains. The evidence clearly shows the substantial economic losses that can result from reputational harm due to false advertising, misleading bidding, financial misrepresentations, and other unethical practices.

The author believes this economic argument will be more compelling to business leaders than arguments based primarily on ethics. While businesspeople generally prefer to be ethical, stronger motivations like sales, finances, competition, and career success often override ethical concerns in actual decision-making. Framing deceptive practices as threats to a company's bottom line and survival is more likely to spur action. The evidence that reputational damage causes major economic harm bolsters this case.

So, to address worries that the book's insights into pre-suasion could be misused, the author argues that such misuse is not in companies' best economic interests given the sizable costs to reputation and finances that result. An appeal to business self-interest and economic necessity is viewed as the most persuasive approach with commercial organizations.

 

- The author initially thought business leaders would avoid unethical behavior due to the economic costs of being caught, like damage to reputation and lost business. 
- However, surveys show many business leaders are aware of these costs but still engage in unethical behavior. The author thinks this is because they do not expect to get caught.
- To address this, the author and colleagues looked at the internal costs of unethical behavior that leaders would likely face even if the behavior is not discovered. They found three central "tumors" in organizations with corrupt cultures: poor employee performance, high employee turnover, and employee fraud/misconduct.
- The highest cost is poor employee performance. Moral stress from an unethical culture causes fatigue, burnout, and unsatisfactory work performance. An experiment found that exposing people to a deceitful work culture negatively impacted their critical reasoning and productivity. 
- Turnover also increases costs due to recruiting, training, and lost productivity. Studies show ethical culture is a significant factor in employee satisfaction and intent to stay with a company. 
- Fraud and other unethical behavior by employees represent huge costs due to lost resources and productivity. Surveys show corrupt cultures correlate with higher fraud and misconduct.
- The overall point is that unethical behavior and cultures have significant hidden costs due to their impact on employees and organizations. Business leaders should consider these costs and not assume unethical behavior is worthwhile if it is not discovered. Building an ethical culture will likely have economic benefits.

In summary, the key reasons business leaders engage in unethical behavior despite the risks of being caught are:

1) They do not expect to get caught 
2) They do not fully consider the internal costs of unethical behavior, like:
- Poor employee performance from moral stress
- High employee turnover 
- Employee fraud and malfeasance

The research shows these internal costs can be substantial, so leaders and organizations should work to prevent unethical behavior for economic reasons, not just reputational ones. An ethical culture is essential for organizational health and performance.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- A study found that participants who worked in a deceptive team scored 20% lower on a test and gave up sooner, suggesting lower motivation. 
- To address criticisms of that study, the researchers surveyed working adults. They found similar results: unethical work environments led to poorer performance and more stress, and the stress caused poor performance. 
- Voluntary employee turnover is costly, estimated to be at least one year's compensation. Unethical work environments lead to more employee desire to quit, especially for ethical employees.  
- An experiment found that 51% of people in an ethical group chose to switch groups, but 80% of people in an unethical group decided to change, suggesting honorable people want to leave corrupt environments. The survey confirmed this.
- The researchers argue that unethical companies will be left with fewer ethical employees and more prone to commit employee fraud and misconduct, which costs trillions annually. 
- An experiment found that people who stayed in an unethical group were 77% more likely to cheat for financial gain, even at the expense of their colleagues. The survey found that employees in dishonest companies who wanted to stay were more potential to harm the company through deceitful actions like expense report fraud.
- In summary, unethical business practices can lead to poor performance, high turnover (especially of ethical employees), and costly employee fraud. Creating an ethical work environment can help avoid these costs.

The key conclusions are that "strike one" against unethical business practices is that they lead to poor performance; "strike two" is that they lead to costly employee turnover; and "strike three" is that they foster employee fraud and misconduct. The researchers argue that establishing an ethical organizational culture can help companies avoid these costly consequences.

 

The author recounts how a decision derailed his plans to write about pre-suasion during a stay at a school. However, he also saw some positive outcomes, like gaining good stories to tell and including recent research. One positive was getting students to write about their experiences in ethical or unethical work cultures. One student wrote about a company that started healthily but lost $1 billion after the CEO abused influence principles, causing high turnover and low morale. 

The author hopes leaders will consider arguments against duplicity and nurture ethical work cultures. Recommendations include:

1) Customer ratings of employee honesty as part of incentives 
2) Company ethical reputation as part of performance assessments
3) Employee ratings of company ethics as part of executive compensation

Focusing on ethics can elevate their perceived importance. About half of the leaders feel economics warrant dishonesty, so countervailing costs like underperformance and turnover must be shown.

Pre-suasion can work by temporarily directing attention, but rival communicators can divert that attention. Two strategies create lasting change:

1) Install firm commitments: Have people take active steps to commit to a response. A study found appointment reminders cut no-shows by 3.5%, but having patients fill in appointment cards cut them by 18%. Exposure to a US flag made people support Republican McCain; those who then took a survey committed to that view voted Republican and still supported Republicans 8 months later. The initial exposure was pre-suasive; the commitments made the effect last.

2) Change environments: Repeated exposure in the same place breeds familiarity and liking. Cues in an environment can also trigger a response without consciousness. Changing settings removes those influences, allowing new replies. The rotation of products, ads, music, scents, etc., in stores and redesigning rooms, buildings, and routes can help. Familiarity may build contentment, but changing environments create adaptiveness.

In summary, pre-suasion works best when people commit to the induced mindset or shift their environment to support the change. Firm commitments and environmental changes help new attitudes and behaviors persist.

 

- Persuasion professionals use techniques to create lasting change in people by influencing their identities. They do this by ensuring people make active, voluntary, and effortful commitments to the desired changes. These types of obligations signal deep personal preferences and shape self-perception. 

- For example, showing someone images of togetherness may temporarily make them support an inclusive policy like raising the minimum wage. If they then freely donate money to that cause, it reinforces their view of themselves as someone who supports that policy. This self-perception then guides their future opinions and actions on the issue.

- The author attended a "wealth opportunity" event where participants were bussed between Phoenix and Tucson. The organizers exposed people to their sales pitch on the buses, using various persuasive cues in the environment to encourage people to sign up since the noisy, chaotic setting made critical thinking difficult. 

- Modern life is increasingly fast-paced, chaotic, and saturated with stimuli. This makes people more prone to react based on environmental cues rather than careful thought. We can use this to our advantage by systematically controlling the lines in our everyday environments to guide our automatic reactions and behaviors in desirable directions.

- Examples include surrounding yourself with images linked to your goals, like audience members' faces if you want to connect with them or Rodin's The Thinker if you wish to have an analytical mindset. "If-then" plans that link cues to actions are also useful, e.g., "If it's 8 am, then I'll take my medicine."

- A study showed that physicians, who are usually hard to influence, washed their hands more when signs in examination rooms reminded them to do it to protect patients rather than themselves. This suggests doctors are more motivated by concern for their patients than for themselves. People in helping professions may be more persuaded by appeals focusing on benefiting others.

That covers the key highlights and main takeaways from the given summary on using environmental cues and self-perception to create lasting change. Please let me know if you want me to explain or expand on any summary part.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

• Simply reminding physicians about the link between hand washing and patient health led to significant improvements in hand hygiene and reduced patient infection rates. This shows that directing attention to the right factors can significantly impact behavior. 

• However, other research found that many physicians accept gifts and payments from pharmaceutical and medical device companies, even though this can compromise patient care. When physicians were reminded of their sacrifices in their training and careers, they became much more accepting of these industry gifts. This suggests physicians' judgments can be swayed by factors that are made salient to them.

• The results of these two studies show that physicians, like all people, are subject to the influence of whatever happens to be at the top of their minds at a given moment. Their preferences and judgments are quite malleable depending on the cues in their environment. 

• The factors that shape our attention and thinking at any moment can be random or manipulated by outside agents. But we can also expose ourselves to cues and prompts that steer us in a desired direction through habit and practice. Developing this "made moment" is crucial in shaping our behavior.

• In summary, who we are in any given situation depends profoundly on where our attention is focused. Our attention and judgments are highly flexible, but we can work to channel them constructively.

The key conclusions are that human thinking and behavior are highly subject to the influence of factors made salient at the moment. Still, people can also develop habits and practices to focus their attention in deliberately chosen ways. Overall, this research illustrates how profoundly "where we are" attentionally shapes "who we are" and what we do.

 Here is a summary of the references:

• Employees voluntarily leave their jobs due to work perceptions and job satisfaction. Turnover can be reduced by improving work perceptions and the work environment. 
• Employees' work perceptions and job satisfaction significantly impact a company's bottom line. Improving work perceptions can increase productivity, customer satisfaction, and profitability.
• Playing violent video games over a long period increases aggressive behavior and hostile expectations. The effects accumulate and intensify over time.
• Dehumanization involves perceiving a group as less civilized or human. It is associated with prejudice, discrimination, and violence toward the dehumanized group.

The authors review research showing people's judgments about responsibility for events are influenced by self-centered biases. People take more credit for good team outcomes and less blame for bad ones than is warranted. These egocentric biases emerge from normal psychological processes. Still, they can have significant implications, such as reducing motivation to change one's behavior after failure or limiting willingness to give others proper credit. 

The authors describe two main reasons for these egocentric judgments:

1. Self-serving attributions: We tend to make internal attributions (to our effort or skill) for successes and external attributions (to circumstances outside our control) for failures. This leads us to claim more responsibility for good outcomes and less for bad results.

2. Differential attention: We have better access to and understand our contributions and efforts. This "self-attention" leads us to overvalue our role in events, especially for complex team outcomes. We perceive our role as more significant than it is.

The authors review research on "self-serving biases," "the fundamental attribution error," and "egocentric anchoring" that supports these explanations. While self-enhancing biases can be adaptive in moderation, stronger egocentric tendencies are problematic, and interventions may be needed to improve judgment accuracy and team dynamics. Overall, this research provides a sobering reminder of the limits of human judgment - even when we have the best intentions, we often cannot escape overly self-centered views of responsibility. But with awareness and effort, we can work to overcome these built-in biases.

The summary outlines the two main reasons proposed for people's egocentric judgments of responsibility, summarizes supporting evidence the authors review, notes the adaptive and problematic implications, and concludes by observing that awareness and effort are needed to overcome these inherent limits in human judgment.

 Here are the main points summarized:

- Egocentric biases lead people to overestimate the availability and importance of information linked to themselves (Sicoly & Ross, 1979).
- Trait concepts resist disconfirmation, and people are reluctant to abandon them (Rothbart & Park, 1986). 
- Seeing competitors wearing red can undermine performance (Rowe et al., 2005).  
- People have a negativity bias where adverse events have a more significant impact than positive events (Rozin & Royzman, 2001).
- Multiple social identities can lead to stereotype threat by making negative stereotypes more accessible (Rydell et al., 2009).
- People are motivated to rationalize and defend the status quo (Sagarin et al., 2002). The path of least resistance is appealing (Sagarin  & Mitnick, 2011).
- Reminders of personal sacrifice and suggested rationalizations can increase willingness to accept gifts that violate ethics (Sah & Loewenstein, 2010). 
- Managers attribute organizational outcomes to factors within their control to reinforce perceptions of their competence (Salancik & Mendl, 1984).
- Mayors have limited influence over city budgetary allocations (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1977).
- People selectively test hypotheses that confirm preexisting beliefs (Sanbonmatsu et al., 1989).
- Online panels can generate representative samples with high response rates (Scherpenzeel & Toepol, 2012).
- The focusing illusion leads people to overestimate the impact of salient factors on life satisfaction judgments (Schkade & Kahneman, 1998).
- An integrated process model of stereotype threat shows how cognitive, affective, and motivational factors undermine performance (Schmader et al., 2008).
- Interests, abilities, personality traits, and achievements reflect the influence of many factors (Schmidt, 2014). 
- Mere exposure to alcohol-related cues is enough to activate an inclination to drink in problematic alcohol users (Schreiner, 2013).

- Social psychology could benefit from the prestige and credibility of behavioral economics. Behavioral economics shares some critical ideas with social psychology but has more credibility and prestige, partly because some behavioral economists have won Nobel Prizes. Social psychology's reputation improves if people associate social psychology with behavioral economics.

- The studies on restaurant names, jersey numbers, chocolate, work performance, line drawings, and wine shops show that initial experiences alter how people respond to what comes next, often in strange ways. Recent theories use quantum probability models to explain how making a decision can change someone's state of mind and lead to illogical outcomes.

- Jim removed obstacles to persuasion by building trust and similarity. Other pre-suasions that build trust include establishing similarity. Momentum and timing also matter for effectiveness. Influence became a severe study area during World War II with government communication programs. 

- There is no credible evidence for paranormal ways of judging people. Humans tend to give more attention and meaning to events than non-vents. This bias emerges even in chess masters and leads to poor decision making. Brilliant individuals like Sherlock Holmes, Abraham Wald, and Mark Zuckerberg excel at noticing what did not happen or was not said.

- People tend to seek and believe information that confirms what they already think (confirmatory hypothesis testing). Single-chute survey questions can be misleading. Adding a balancing option to a survey question can change responses.

- The author has studied persuasion using experiments and analyzing the tactics of influence professionals like advertisers, marketers, and cult recruiters. Cults use persuasion to recruit and keep members. Providing an email after being asked an adventurousness question reflects magnified feelings of adventurousness and not liking the researcher. A study giving students fliers found that an adventurousness question increased interest, even without interacting with the researcher.

 

- Researchers conducted studies on the impact of questions that prompt a desired response. For example, they found that asking students, "Can I have your contact details?" resulted in 55% providing their details compared to the typical response rate of 5-10%. Another study found that questions focusing on a person's identity as a voter (e.g., "How important is it for you to be a voter?") increased voter turnout compared to questions focused on the act of voting. 

- There has been a rapid rise in online fraud and scams. Tactics include obtaining someone's email under pretenses and sending them malware or viruses. This leverages the tendency for people's awareness of one concept to inhibit understanding of alternatives. For example, focusing on one meaning of a word can hinder recognizing other purposes.

- Humans have a limited capacity for conscious awareness and can generally only focus on one conscious experience, visual, auditory, or otherwise. This helps explain the risks of distracted driving, as people cannot simultaneously focus on driving and phone conversations. An "attentional blink" causes people to miss information presented closely in time. 

- Giving increased attention to something makes people perceive it as more important or valuable. For example, snacks that participants approached were rated as more desirable. Milton H. Erickson would have clients repeatedly focus on and visualize desired outcomes. 

- Daniel Kahneman identified the "focusing illusion"—the tendency to overestimate the importance of the thing one is focused on—as the most valuable scientific concept. Support comes from research showing that items at the center of a display receive more attention and are more likely to be purchased. Media agenda-setting also offers how focus guides perceived importance, as the public rates the importance of issues mainly based on the media's focus.

In summary, attention is a powerful force that shapes perception, guides behavior, and influences choice. Manipulating focus and attention can significantly impact how people think and act.

 
• Attention naturally fades over time (Engelberg, Sasseville, and Williams,
2011). Media focus affects perceptions of importance, e.g. attention to
grassroots movements increases perceived significance (Smidt, 2012). Many
factors determine media agenda (Boydstun, 2013). 
• Celebrities are "known for being well known" (Boorstin). Reality TV
stars validate this. Their notoriety shows Kahneman's focusing illusion. 
Celebrity role has changed (Inglis, 2010).
• Attention elevates importance, and importance gains attention. E.g.
Accessible attitudes seem more critical (Bizer & Krosnick, 2001; Roese
& Oleson, 1994). Looking at an item increases perceived value (Lim et al.,
2011; Krajbich et al., 2009).
• Wallpaper and banner ads lose effect over exposure (Mandel and Johnson,
2002; Fang, Singh, and Ahluwalia, 2007; Reinhard et al., 2014). Background
noise harms attention and health (Bronzaft and McCarthy, 1974; Bronzaft, 1981; 
Hygge, Evans, and Bullinger, 2002; Clark and Sörqvist, 2012; Steward, 2011;
Szalma and Hancock, 2011. Classroom wall effects (Fisher, Godwin, and
Seltman 2014).  
• More attention to poor idea often backfires (Armel, Beaumel, and Rangel,
2008 and others).  
• Rating product alone elevates status, sales (Dhar & Simonson, 1992; Dhar
et al., 1999; Kardes et al., 2002; Posavac et al., 2002, 2004, 2005; Sanbonmatsu
et al., 1998; Posavac et al., 2010). Satisficing is norm; more so when
resources low (Kardes, 2013; Wang & Wyer, 2002). Debiasing works
(many studies). Debiasing increases ROI (Lovallo and Sibony, 2010;
Kahneman, Lovallo, and Sibony, 2011).
• Embedded reporting made war seem about soldiers not strategists.
Opposition seen as unfair (Liberman and Trope, 1998; Trope and Liberman,
2010). Program screened reporters (Aday et al., 2005; Cortell et al., 2009;
Lindner 2008, 2009; Pfau et al., 2004, 2005, 2006; Reed, 2009; Reed et al., 2009).

• Wait for line study (Oberholzer-Gee, 2006). Help vulnerable others (many
studies). 
• What is focal seems causal (Taylor & Fiske, 1978). Loud, colorful seems
causal (Robinson and Zebrowitz-McArthur, 1982; Zebrowitz-McArthur and
Ginsberg, 1981; Hagemann, Strauss, and Leissing, 2008; Rowe, Harris, and
Roberts, 2005).  
• False confessions common (many experts). Avoid lawyers to seem innocent
However, it backfires (Ramsey case). 
• Factors increasing false confessions: misleading evidence (Blagrove, 1996),
lengthy interrogations (Kassin et al., 2010), sleep deprivation (Leding, 2012),
misinformation (Loftus, 2011), coercive interrogation (Mazzoni and Memon,
2003), youth/intellectual disability (Perillo and Kassin, 2011; Rajagopal and
Montgomery, 2011), high suggestibility (Shaw & Porter, 2015).  
• Interrogators want confessions for credit and ego (Inbau et al., 2001).

 

- Ratings, publicity, and ego boosts in high-stakes decision making can lead to poor judgments. 

- False confessions can corrupt other evidence and lead to wrongful convictions. Studies show that confessions, even false ones, can convince others involved in a case of a defendant's guilt.

- Mere point of view in recorded confessions can significantly impact responsibility assessments. Studies show that when recordings show only the interrogator, people assign more responsibility to the confessor than when the camera also shows the confessor.

- There is a tendency to overestimate the role of leaders and CEOs. Research shows CEO pay has skyrocketed while average worker pay has remained flat, even though CEO impact is often overrated. High pay inequality can negatively impact trust and happiness in a society.

- Attention attractors like sex and threat can be powerful persuaders but also risk backfiring or causing unintended effects. While attracting attention, they may fail to convince or produce avoidance and defensive reactions. Fear appeals, in particular, require offering solutions to be most effective. 

- Curiosity and orienting responses are powerful tools for attracting attention, but they also risk distracting from a message. While an orienting response brings attention to a stimulus, it also briefly disrupts cognitive processing, which can hamper understanding or recall of information presented during that time. 

- Similarly, abrupt cuts, flashy visuals, and quirky elements in ads may attract attention but also distract from and weaken understanding or recall of the ad and its message. These unforced errors stem from an overeager attempt to grab interest that fails to focus attention on what matters.

In summary, while specific techniques effectively command attention, wielding attention for persuasion requires precision and restraint to avoid unintended impacts. An overreliance on attention attractors risks compromising a persuasive message and its convincing ability.

 

Ads that are unnecessarily complex and contain many rapidly changing visuals are generally less persuasive. Ads that selectively focus viewers' attention on critical persuasive arguments or product attributes are more effective, especially if the arguments are compelling. 

Research shows that aspects of ads that change location from one presentation to the next automatically draw more attention and increase preference for the product, even without awareness. Cultural factors also influence attention; Westerners focus on central elements while Easterners notice contextual details more.

 Around birthdays, people are more open to healthy lifestyle changes. Personalized health messages timed around birthdays could effectively promote behavior change. Tailored messages are more persuasive, though superficial personalization needs more impact.

People's memories for what comes before and after their speech or performance suffer due to anxiety, a "next-in-line" effect. The Zeigarnik effect refers to better recall for unfinished tasks or unmet goals. This effect is more substantial for people highly committed to a task and events closer to task completion. Uncertain or unknown sources of kindness also prompt more rumination. Incomplete TV ads and stories are better remembered.

Many authors characterize writing as difficult and painful, though they value having written. University professors often prefer conventional and conservative fashions. With many TV options, programs and ads that fail to capture and hold attention powerfully could be more effective. Memorable, personally relevant, and emotionally evocative messages are the most persuasive.

 

TV producers use mystery and suspense to keep viewers engaged during commercial breaks. They pose an intriguing question before the break and answer it after to maintain interest. Explanations and participation enhance understanding. Rather than lecturing audiences, inviting them to speculate and provide input is optimal. At the end, ask them for alternative explanations that fit the evidence.  

Mystery stories have been used effectively in entertainment and branding. Empirical evidence shows that available counterarguments reduce the persuasiveness of an opponent's message, especially if a counterargument directly refutes a claim or undermines the opponent's trustworthiness. Once deception is revealed, people resist the associated influence and persuader.  

Many factors make an idea "sticky" or memorable, including self-relevant, unfinished, simple, unexpected, concrete, credible, emotional, or story-based. Associative or connectionist processes underlie all thinking in humans and other animals. They are involved in conditioning, categorization, coordination, concept formation, object recognition, choice, learning, memory, inference, generalization, creativity, reading comprehension, priming, and attitude change. A sense of meaning or purpose comes from reliable associations between things.

Language is used strategically, not just descriptively. The language used can influence thinking and behavior through its associations. For example, evaluating Arabs and Jews in Arabic or Hebrew led bilingual participants to favor one group over another, depending on the language used. An organization's nonviolent language policy stemmed from its founders' principles.

Exposure to hostile words increased aggressive behavior. Other research shows that exposure to words or images related to achievement, helpfulness, cooperativeness, fairness, insight, disclosure, loyalty, and rudeness led to corresponding behaviors. The effects seem most potent when the stimuli activate valued goals. Although the impact may lessen with repeated exposure, some evidence suggests that effects can last for multiple days. Choosing the right word over the correct argument can be persuasive, as a writer sensitive to language subtleties noted.

A touch is enough to trigger an influential metaphor. Holding a hard or soft object made people perceive social interactions as more or less flexible and open to change. The metaphorical links between touch and social relationships appear innate.

 

Yang et al. (2013) found that handling dirty money can promote dishonest behavior. In seven studies, people handling dirty money were likelier to cheat in subsequent interactions. For example, vendors who handled dirty money underweighted vegetables. Clean money did not have this effect. This suggests that the metaphoric meaning of money (dirty vs. clean) can influence behavior. 

Other research shows that metaphors and physical experiences can influence thinking in surprising ways:

- Thibodeau and Boroditsky (2011): Metaphors comparing crime to a "beast" vs. a "virus" influenced solutions to crime.
- Ackerman et al. (2010); Jostman et al. (2009); Schneider et al. (2015); Zhang and Li (2012): Experiencing physical weight affects perceptions of intellectual weight, importance, and effort. 
- Ijzerman and Semin (2009, 2010); Inagaki and Eisenberger, (2013); Kang et al. (2011); Williams and Bargh (2008): Experiencing physical warmth influences perceptions of social warmth.

Reviews conclude:

1) Communications using strong metaphors are persuasive. 
2) This effect comes from an automatic process where associations from one concept spread to another.

However, some research on implicit egoism (people named Dennis become dentists) is controversial. But other research shows:

- Shared names, birthdays, birthplaces, or initials increase liking, cooperation, compliance, helpfulness, and business. This is less for those with low self-esteem.
- Stronger links to the self (kinship, education, values) produce more significant effects. E.g. French students were very likely to complete a survey from someone with their last name. Education level affected participation. Shared values tripled sales.

Western cultures emphasize individualism; Eastern cultures emphasize community. E.g. A Korean-US magazine ad study. China passed a law allowing suing children who do not visit. A South Korean who promoted himself after freeing hostages was criticized.

Cognitive poetics suggests rhyme and fluency affect thinking. E.g. Rhyming statements seem more authentic. Easy-to-process faces/names seem more attractive. Disfluency has adverse effects, like on law firm advancement or food descriptions. However, disfluency can increase thinking for complex material. Poetry editors prefer non-rhyming. 

In summary, metaphor, physical experience, implicit egoism, and fluency can powerfully and automatically influence thinking, judgment, and behavior positively and negatively. Strong versions are most persuasive, mainly when rooted in meaningful connections between people.

 

- Happiness and positive emotions have significantly impacted health, wealth, and wellbeing. However, these effects are not constant and happiness in inappropriate circumstances can lead to poor outcomes.

- Happier older adults do not ignore negative aspects of life but instead, focus on positive aspects. They accept adverse events but do not dwell on them. This ability to regulate attention and focus on the positive allows people of all ages to achieve psychological wellbeing after traumatic events. According to research, the ability to strategically control and redirect attention is the most effective method for increasing happiness.

- The tendency for older adults to experience more happiness and positive emotions, known as the "positivity paradox," usually does not extend to the end of life. This may be partly due to declines in the ability to control and manage attention and changes in living environments and social connections. Nevertheless, shifting attention away from adverse events and topics can improve mood and happiness at any age.

- Reminding people of negative stereotypes about their group before testing can reduce performance, but several strategies can help buffer against these effects. Research shows there is little evidence for fundamental differences in ability between groups. Apparent differences often come down to preferences and choices. For example, while women and men generally have equal math abilities, women prefer careers focused on social systems rather than inorganic systems. This preference for social interaction appears very early in development. 

- The author's friend Alan struggled with cystic fibrosis his whole life but maintained a positive attitude. Recent research has supported Alan's advice to focus on strengths and accomplishments before high-pressure situations. For example, describing a proud experience before taking an aptitude test can improve performance.

 

The relationships among elements in complex systems can be intricate and multi-faceted. Even a simple conversation among teenagers about their friends and acquaintances can reveal many interconnections. 

Significant research shows that exposure to a concept, like seeing images of people together, can increase the accessibility and influence of associated concepts, like helping behaviors. This can happen even with minimal cues, like seeing dolls pictured together. These priming effects often happen outside of our conscious awareness or control.

Many pre-existing factors within us, like goals, self-identities, culture, gender, personality, etc. remain dormant until activated by some environmental cue. They then spring into action and guide our thinking or behavior along habitual paths. However, we can override these effects if we notice them and are motivated to correct them. Asking ourselves why we may feel or think a certain way can activate this self-correction mechanism.

Positive moods and emotions, like those induced by nice weather or winning a sports event, can temporarily bias our judgments in a favorable direction. We may rate things as more valuable or likeable when we are elated. However, when we realize the source of our mood is irrelevant to the judgment at hand, we can adjust our ratings to account for this influence. Our primitive associations do not necessarily determine our higher-level thinking. We can constrain and correct them.

In summary, many complex interactions exist between environmental events, our pre-existing mental constructs, transient states like moods, and our capacity for deliberation and self-correction. Simple exposures and associations exert considerable influence but do not inevitably govern our thoughts and actions. Our minds display both automated and flexible cognitive functions.

 

The passage discusses research on product placements, explaining that conspicuous product placements can backfire and reduce audience favorability toward a brand, incredibly if repetitive. Subtle product placements, on the other hand, can be practical even when repeated. Two other cues that can prompt people to correct for potential influences are extremity (e.g., increasingly higher numbers can prompt jurors to adjust in the opposite direction) and vital opposing goals (e.g. a decisive goal to avoid prejudice can prompt correction of stereotypical responses). 

There is research supporting the existence of correction mechanisms in the brain. Many scholars argue that there are two systems: rational/analytical and emotional/experiential systems. Late-night fatigue and limited time to evaluate information can reduce one's ability to resist influence. Broadcast media also leads people to focus more on communicator qualities than message content.

There are six significant principles of influence: authority, consistency, reciprocation, liking, scarcity, and social proof. However, a pre-suasive message focusing attention on a principle will only be effective if there is compelling evidence to support it. For example, focusing on consistency will polarize responses depending on individuals' existing views on consistency.

Reciprocation, the tendency to give back to those who have given to us, is a vital influence principle. Even small initial favors, gifts or concessions can stimulate feelings of obligation to return the favor. Reciprocation can be seen in contexts like free store samples, campaign contributions, and survey participation. Giving first is an effective reciprocity tactic because it makes recipients feel obligated to give back. While obligation stimulates returns, gratitude also powerfully motivates reciprocity through appreciation rather than debt.

 

The research suggests that compliments and expressions of praise or approval can compel relationship changes rather than just initiating or sustaining them. Studies show that compliments feel good and lead us to like those who give them to us. This is because receiving praise activates the same pleasure centers in the brain that other rewards activate. 

While flattery and compliments can be persuasive and make us feel good, we tend to discount praise and compliments that seem insincere. Research also suggests that we expect those who like us, such as friends, to give us honest counsel and feedback, not just empty compliments. 

Similarity is another factor that leads to liking and feelings of connection. We like similar interests, backgrounds, behaviors, values, and communication styles. Similarity can enhance mentoring relationships, lead to more significant attraction and relationship stability, improve the outcomes of negotiations, increase sales, and boost the likelihood of providing emergency assistance to those in need.

Social proof, or the actions and opinions of others, also significantly impacts relationships. We frequently look to others, incredibly similar or high-status others, to help determine appropriate attitudes and behaviors. This tendency to consider social consensus and prevailing norms when deciding how to think or act is known as social proof. The research shows that social proof shapes a variety of judgments and behaviors, including perceptions of morality, validity, and feasibility.

Finally, credibility is critical to establishing trust and influence within relationships. There are two primary routes to credibility: expertise and trustworthiness. Evidence shows that perceived experts and those viewed as objective and trustworthy are seen as highly credible and persuasive. An effective tactic for building trustworthiness is willingly disclosing a weakness or downside, making subsequent information and arguments seem more balanced and honest. Disclosing a weakness, when followed by an assertion of strength, is commonly used in advertising, public relations, and legal arguments to establish credibility and trust.

 Here is a summary of the key ideas:

- Positive information is most effective in countering negative information when directly undercuts the negativity. Research supports this idea. 

- Scarcity and loss aversion drive people to want more items. People think rare items are more valuable, dislike restrictions on their freedom to obtain items, and try to restore that freedom. Data from various industries and news stories illustrate this.

- A study found that prayer reduced reported infidelities, especially prayer focused on a partner's wellbeing. Other research shows that reminding people of past commitments spurs consistent future action. However, "moral licensing" can sometimes occur, where people feel entitled to self-interest after moral behavior. Moral identity and cost influence whether consistency or licensing occurs.

- In-groups produce many benefits, including agreement, trust, cooperation, support, forgiveness, and favorable judgments of creativity, morality, and humanness. Favoritism for in-groups appears across cultures and in infants. Exchanges like holiday cards operate based on reciprocity within in-groups.  

- People confuse themselves and in-group members, projecting traits onto each other, poorly distinguishing each other's traits, and taking longer to identify differences. Neuroscience shows that in-group representations activate common brain areas. Other cognitive confusions stem from the brain reusing structures in new contexts. 

- Inclusive fitness and kin selection help explain favoritism for genetic relatives. Evidence shows people favor kin especially in life-threatening situations. Information on genetic similarity can reduce hostility between groups. Teenagers' brains reward them for helping the family. "Fictive kin" groups gain benefits of real families. Focusing on group identity amplifies attention to identity-consistent information. 

- Fiction and research demonstrate offspring's powerful pull on their parents. A short story by Ernest Hemingway illustrates this dramatically in just six words. 

- Warren Buffett's 2014 letter discusses vital principles that have guided Berkshire Hathaway's success over 50 years. Both biological and psychological kinship lead people to favor those they perceive as similar to themselves.

 Here is a summary of the dimension:

There is substantial evidence that perceived similarity along multiple dimensions, including physical appearance, personality, and attitudes, increases feelings of unity and relatedness between individuals. Similarity on fundamental attitudes related to politics, religion, and sexuality appears particularly impactful because these attitudes are thought to be highly heritable and central to one's sense of identity.

Research finds that early experiences of diversity and perceived inclusiveness are linked to subsequently more prosocial and altruistic orientations toward dissimilar others. Notable examples include the rescuer Chiune Sugihara, who helped thousands of Jews escape Nazi-occupied Lithuania during World War II, and the residents of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, who sheltered Jewish refugees during the Holocaust. Their aid to outsider groups has been attributed to a comprehensive sense of we that incorporated people entirely dissimilar from themselves.

The perception of being a coherent social unit with another person or group produces feelings of solidarity, shared identity, and willingness to act cooperatively. This can occur through passive exposure to local community members and more active participation in synchronous or imitative activities with others. Engaging in synchronous behavior, in particular, has been shown to increase perceived similarity and feelings of connectedness even with dissimilar or unfamiliar individuals. These social binding effects evolved to foster cooperation within groups.

Synchronous or imitative action is associated with conformity, cooperation, and altruism toward the group or partner one coordinates with. The act of jointly focusing attention on a stimulus or event also intensifies the experience and signals that the thing is of high importance or relevance to the relationship. Coordinated behavior is a mechanism by which group solidarity and priorities are developed and maintained. Supportive collective action is considered the gold standard of social influence as it produces commitment to group interests in a way that appeals alone do not.

In sum, perceived similarity and shared experiences, especially those involving synchronous or imitative behavior, are tremendously impactful in creating feelings of unity and collective identity. Their effects affect prosociality, prejudice reduction, and the spread of group priorities or norms.

 

Several studies show that unethical behavior can lead to significant financial losses through reputational damage. They are rebuilding trust after dishonest acts can be brutal. However, despite knowing the risks, many business leaders are willing to act unethically to benefit their company financially. Data shows that unethical behavior remains common in many businesses and industries.

Creating change in the factors that influence unethical behavior is challenging but essential. Two studies found that synchronous behavior like marching or tapping in unison can promote group cohesion and willingness to harm outsiders. Music is also socially unitizing and promotes group solidarity. Emotional and rational decision making involve different systems in the brain, and persuasion is most effective when messages match the system involved in forming the recipient's attitude.

Young women highly value music, which operates outside of rational processes. Popular songs frequently focus on romantic themes, showing the role of emotion. An experiment found that people were more willing to provide their phone number to a stranger carrying a guitar case, highlighting how music elicits positive feelings. 

Emotional attitudes often do not match rational recognition, as in unrequited love. Wilderness management should consider ecological factors, not just human ones. Studies show people value items they build themselves (the "Ikea effect") and coworkers they collaborate with. Collaboration also promotes generosity in young children and benefits education. However, paying people too much for their input can undermine communal feelings.

Simple solutions often do not work for complex problems. Scientists can make overly confident proclamations outside their areas of expertise as they age ("booming about Big Issues"). The chapter advises avoiding this and recognizing the complexity of significant problems.

In summary, the key ideas are:

1) Unethical behavior damages reputations and trust, though it remains common. 
2) Emotion and rationality involve different brain systems, so persuasion should match the system forming the target's attitude. 
3) Music, collaboration, and synchronous behavior promote social bonding and group cohesion. 
4) Simple solutions rarely work for complex problems, and we should avoid overconfidence from expertise in one area.

 

- A research study found that placing a sign reminding doctors that their patients are vulnerable to infection led to increased hand washing. This shows how reminding people of previous commitments can induce behavior change.
- Research has found that even small gifts from pharmaceutical companies lead physicians to prescribe drugs from those companies at higher rates. This highlights how seemingly inconsequential triggers can significantly influence judgment and behavior due to previously established mental links.  
- Although people exhibit consistent behavior patterns due to stable tendencies and traits, these influences operate through the same psychological processes as temporary situational influences. The difference is that in the case of personality, the relevant cues that trigger behavior are chronically accessible. However, the underlying mechanism is the same.
- A person's self-concept and lasting change are most impacted by active, effortful, voluntary and sometimes public commitments. These commitments can direct behavior for a long time after they are made. 
- To achieve durable change, we have to activate thinking-absent mechanisms thoughtfully. Although ironic, this approach is supported by research showing that automatic systems can be engaged in a planful fashion. The key is understanding how those systems work.
- Positive moods can have enduring effects on evaluations and judgments, especially if people register and "lock in" those evaluations actively and thoughtfully.

In summary, the key themes around achieving lasting change and influence are leveraging
 existing commitmentsusing,
 small triggers to activate those commitments recognizing,
 that personality and situations operate similarly at a psychological level employing,
 active and voluntary commitments,
thoughtfully engaging automatic mechanisms, and
promote active consideration of judgments and choices.

 

Influences on our thoughts, feelings, and actions can come from abiding sources (e.g., genetic factors, life experiences) that have made specific cues chronically accessible and situational factors (e.g., recent interactions, events) that have temporarily increased the accessibility of cues. 

Abiding influences:
- Genetics: Our genetic heritage shapes how accessible specific cues/associations become. 
- Life experiences: The events we have lived through, especially early in life, influence what cues and associations become firmly established and chronically accessible in our minds.

Situational influences:
- Recent events: Things that have happened recently in our environments or interactions can temporarily boost the accessibility of particular cues, making them come more readily to mind for the time being.

In both cases, more accessible cues have a more remarkable ability to influence our judgments, decisions, and behaviors, often without realizing it. However, their effects are temporary (situational influences) or persistent (abiding influences).

 Here is a summary of the key terms and concepts:

- Geographies of influence: The idea that our thoughts and behaviors can be influenced by exposure to places and locations. This can happen through:

- Contagion: The spread of ideas, feelings, and behaviors from one person to another without direct intervention or intent. Moods and emotions can spread between people nearby.  

- Internal influences: The environments within a location like a workplace or school can shape how people think and act. For example, exposure to a messy, unorganized work environment may promote messy, unorganized thinking.  

- Neighborhood norms: The attitudes and behaviors that are common and acceptable within a given location or region. People tend to conform to the norms of the locations they inhabit and associate with.

- Kinship: The network of social relationships based on familial connections and ancestry. People are profoundly influenced by the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors within their family and ethnic groups. 

- Locality: The sense of connection and loyalty people feel toward the specific geographic places they are from or inhabit. Where we are from shapes how we think and act in powerful ways.  

- Region: Broader geographic areas, like countries, states, or provinces. The region a person is from or identifies with influences their attitudes, beliefs, values, and behaviors. Regional norms shape how people within that region tend to think and act.

- Home: The place a person lives and makes their residence strongly influences their thoughts, feelings, and actions. Through exposure and habit, we internalize the norms of our home environments.

- Post-suasion: The idea that persuasion does not end with exposure to a persuasive message. What happens after the initial exposure can significantly strengthen or weaken its impact and influence. Things like:

- Commitments: When people commit to an idea or course of action, it becomes self-reinforcing. They will adopt views and take actions consistent with that prior commitment.  

- Cues: Subtle reminders of a prior exposure to persuasion (like images, sounds or words) that reactivate the thoughts and feelings from that initial exposure, making people more susceptible to its message and influence.

- Planning: Making concrete if-then plans for how one will think and act in line with a persuasive message increases the likelihood of those responses happening. Planning translates persuasion into action.
