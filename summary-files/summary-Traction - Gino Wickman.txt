- As an entrepreneur, you likely face frustrations like lack of control, people issues, lack of profit, hitting a ceiling, and inability to gain traction. The Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) can help eliminate these frustrations. 

- EOS is a practical system based on real-world experience, not theory. It has helped many businesses scale up, gain control, become more profitable, break through ceilings, and thrive.

- The six key components of EOS are:

1. Vision: Having a clear, shared vision that everyone works toward. Without this, people row in different directions.

2. People: Having the right people in the right seats. The wrong people can limit your vision. 

3. Data: Having accurate, objective data to gain insight into your company and key indicators. Data reduces speculation. 

4. Issues: Identifying and solving issues that stand in the way of progress. Unaddressed issues sap energy and momentum.

5. Process: Streamlining and documenting business processes to maximize efficiency and scalability. Lack of process leads to inconsistency and inefficiency.  

6. Traction: Executing well and gaining momentum through focused strategic planning and goal achievement. Without traction, vision and strategy lie dormant.  

- By strengthening each of these six key components, EOS helps integrate your business into a unified, successful whole. It helps you gain control, become less stressful, more profitable, break through ceilings, and achieve your vision.

- EOS is a simple but complete system based on timeless business truths. It has been refined over years of real-world experience helping entrepreneurial companies. By implementing EOS, you can transform your business.

 Here's a summary:

The key to success is focus. By focusing everyone's energy on one vision, a company can achieve amazing results, like a laser beam cutting through diamonds. The Vision/Traction Organizer tool helps companies define and convey their vision.

Having the right people in the right roles is essential. The People Analyzer tool helps companies determine who shares their core values and simplify hiring, firing, reviews, rewards, and recognition. The Accountability Chart helps structure the organization and define roles and responsibilities. The GWC tool ensures any new hire gets the vision, wants the work, and has the capacity to execute.

Data and metrics drive good management. A Scorecard report provides a weekly pulse on key numbers, enabling quick detection and solution of problems. Empowering all employees with clear metrics and accountability creates transparency into the business.

Issues must be faced to achieve the vision. The Issues List tool compartmentalizes and prioritizes issues. An open culture encourages people to voice concerns. The Issues Solving Track tool identifies, discusses, and solves organizational issues. 

Well-defined processes drive efficiency, scalability, and profitability. The Three-Step Process Documenter tool captures a company's business model and core processes in a single document. Training staff on processes enhances troubleshooting, reduces errors, and improves the bottom line.

Discipline and execution are required to gain traction. Rocks provide 90-day priorities to keep people focused on what's important. Meeting Pulses, especially Level 10 meetings focused on conflict resolution, keep people aligned, accountable, and communicating. Vision without traction is hallucination.

In summary, the six key components of EOS are:

1. Vision: Define and convey the vision. 
2. People: Get the right people in the right seats.
3. Data: Manage with metrics and transparency. 
4. Issues: Face and solve issues openly and honestly.
5. Process: Define, document, and follow standard processes.
6. Traction: Provide discipline and accountability to execute the vision.

 
- Successful companies have a clear vision, the right people in the right roles, manage key numbers, solve issues promptly, have documented processes, set priorities, and have trust, communication and accountability.  
- Most companies operate below 50% in these areas. Achieving over 80% leads to high performance. 
- To improve, companies need to “let go of the vine” - change inefficient habits and embrace four beliefs:

1. Build a real leadership team. A dictatorship won't scale and is exhausting. Share decision making and accountability.

2. Hitting a ceiling is inevitable without change. Grow by empowering your leadership team.

3. You can only have one operating system. Choose a clear vision and approach. 

4. Be open-minded, growth-oriented and vulnerable. Admit current weaknesses and limitations to evolve.

- To build a leadership team, choose leaders better than you in each area. Give them clear expectations, communication and accountability. Let them run their areas.

- Your leadership team must unite to solve issues. As they go, so goes the company. Present a united front.

- Change is hard but necessary. Your company can thrive without you controlling everything. With the right vision, structure and people, it can reach its full potential.

- You have three choices: live with the current state, leave the company or change it. Admit you don't want to continue as is and have faith in improving.

- Letting go of control and trusting your leadership team is scary but critical for growth. Your company can become self-sustaining.

 

- Growth is inevitable for organizations and they expand in spurts by breaking through ceilings. Leaders need to understand this and focus on internal growth before external growth. 
- 50-80% of small businesses fail within the first 5-10 years, often because they are unable to survive growing pains and break through ceilings.
- To survive hitting ceilings, leadership teams need 5 core abilities:

1. Simplify - Streamline rules, processes, systems, messages. Use models and visuals. Less is more.

2. Delegate - Delegate less important tasks to focus on higher-level work. Need to delegate to elevate to your best skills. Let go of details that constrict growth.

3. Predict - Do long-term (90 days+) and short-term (daily/weekly) prediction. Long-term is deciding the future path. Short-term is solving immediate problems affecting the long-term. Leaders need the long view.

4. Systemize - Identify and integrate core processes into a functioning whole. Have processes for HR, marketing, sales, operations, customer service, etc. Reduce firefighting and be proactive.

5. Structure - Have the right structure for your stage of growth. May need more levels of management, accountability, and specialization. Structure provides stability for growth.

- These 5 abilities will allow leaders and their teams to break through ceilings, achieve stability, reduce firefighting, and proactively scale for growth. Growth means either you're growing or you're dying. Leadership's role is to achieve internal growth to enable external growth and long term success.

 

The key points around the Vision Component are:

1. The vision starts with the entrepreneur. They must get their vision out of their head and onto paper so they can share it with others. 

2. Most entrepreneurs can see their vision clearly but mistakenly assume everyone else in the organization sees it too. In reality, staff are often confused and the vision goes unrealized.

3. Clarifying your vision helps in making better decisions about people, processes, finances, strategies, and customers. Getting everyone on the same page solves problems faster.

4. When everyone is rowing in the same direction, as per the quote, you can dominate any industry. A lack of vision and direction causes ceilings and stalled growth.

5. A case study of a technology company that had hit a ceiling for two years. The root cause was a lack of vision and direction. They focused their vision and shed two-thirds of their services to focus on one area. This allowed focus and growth, leading to their best quarter.

6. The first step is to define your vision on paper so you can share it with others. The Six Key Components start with Vision. With a clear vision, you gain traction.

In summary, having a clear and shared vision is essential for growth, progress, and high performance. It enables better decision making and problem solving. It gives direction and helps break through ceilings. The key is to define your vision, share it with others, get alignment and buy-in. This forms the foundation for building a great organization.

 
- A vision has to be bigger than you and point to the greater good. 
- To create a strong vision, answer eight questions:

1. What are your core values? These are vital guiding principles, ideally 3 to 7. They define your culture and who you are. Apply them in hiring, firing, reviews, rewards, and recognition. 

2. What is your core focus? This is your organization's purpose and the reason it exists. 

3. What is your 10-year target? Where do you want to be in 10 years? Set a BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal).

4. What is your marketing strategy? How will you achieve your 10-year goal and get in front of your target audience?

5. What is your 3-year picture? What does success look like in 3 years to keep you on track for your 10-year goal? Set key milestones.

6. What is your 1-year plan? What are your priorities and key results for the next 12 months? Set Rocks (key results) and priorities.

7. What are your quarterly Rocks? 90-day priorities - 4 things you must achieve. They determine your focus and activities for the quarter.

8. What are your issues? The obstacles and challenges holding you back that must be resolved. Unaddressed, they prevent achieving your vision.

- Do this as a leadership team in a full 1-2 day offsite. Get clear agreement on the answers. Fill out the Vision/Traction Organizer (V/TO) tool.

- Your core values already exist; you just need to rediscover them. List 3 people you'd clone for market domination. List their qualities. Narrow to 3-7 core values and debate to determine the right ones. These define your culture.

- Apply your vision and core values in all areas of the organization. Use them to make better decisions and build an enduring great company.

 

• Ability to adapt/adjust: We do whatever it takes in every situation. We have fun. We are passionate about our work. 

• We have integrity in all that we do.

• Core values should simmer for 30 days before finalizing. Then communicate them through a presentation speech with stories and examples.

• Follow a pattern for wording the core values, e.g. “To always...” Provide 3-5 examples for each.

• The speech should convey:

- A team-oriented approach: Help others, act for the greater good, be playmakers, teamwork overcomes raw talent.  

- A commitment to excellence: Make a good first impression, be concise and professional, reputation is most important.

- A problem-solving approach: Get the facts, ask questions, debate, assign responsibility, follow up, velocity and quality of decisions matter.  

- Candor: Communicate openly and honestly, seek to improve, be sensitive, don’t talk down, move on from disagreements.  

- Fairness: Demand results, have a sense of equity, be compassionate, fight fairly.  

- Balance: Work smart, focus on output, give back to the community.

• An example core values speech conveys: Integrity, honesty, hard work, service, dedication, and teamwork. These make customers want to work with the company. Stories show responding urgently to help customers and teamwork to meet their needs. The company wants to find others with these values. The future is exciting.

• Core values should guide hiring. Evaluate candidates’ values first before skills. This leads to better hiring and success.

• The core values speech should be given to new hires so they understand the culture.

 

- Core values should be clearly defined, communicated and lived throughout the organization. This helps in growth and success. 
- Core focus determines an organization's success and growth. It should not get distracted by new opportunities that look good on surface but do not align with the core focus. 
- Core focus can be defined as mission statement, vision statement, core business, sweet spot, the zone, the ball, voice, unique ability or hedgehog concept. The leadership team needs to determine the core focus and stick to it.
- An example is given of a company Broder & Sachse Real Estate Services Inc. that lost money and time by getting distracted from their core focus of real estate management by investing in a powder coating business. They learnt from their mistake.
- Determining core focus involves answering two questions:
1. Why does your organization exist? What is its purpose, cause, or passion? The options are purpose, cause or passion.
2. What is your niche? What are you best at? What makes you unique? The niche is what differentiates the organization.

- The leadership team should spend uninterrupted time discussing these two questions and arrive at short answers. The core focus already exists and needs to be uncovered by removing non-core items.
- Examples of purpose: To simplify clients’ printing environments. 
- Examples of cause: To provide high-quality education to underprivileged children.
- Examples of passion: To help small businesses achieve their full potential.

The key is to not overthink and overanalyze. Keep discussing till the team arrives at short answers. The core focus should be broad enough to apply to any industry but specific enough to determine your niche.

 Passion: To build a great company, with great people & great results 

Niche: Simplifying companies’ printing environments

 

To achieve breakthrough success, you need to develop laser-sharp focus in your sales and marketing efforts. Many companies waste resources by lacking a clear strategy. A focused strategy enables you to attract and close the right customers. It provides direction to your team and helps determine which customers you should target. 

According to Douglas Rushkoff, companies need to leverage their own experience and strengths rather than looking externally for solutions. He says to “get back in the box and do the thing you actually do best.”

A marketing strategy has four elements:

1. Target Market (“The List”): Identify your ideal customers through their demographics, geographics, and psychographics. Create a list of perfect prospects to target. This rifle approach is more efficient than a shotgun approach.

2. Three Uniques: Determine what makes you stand out and different from competitors. Settle on three unique qualities that matter to your ideal customers. This creates focus and helps avoid trying to be all things to all people.

3. Proven Process: Develop a standardized process for how you serve customers. Document the steps and train your team. This builds consistency and quality into your offering.

4. Guarantee: Offer a guarantee to reduce perceived risk for new customers and build confidence in your ability to deliver. The guarantee should be meaningful and realistic.

In summary, to achieve breakthrough success, laser-focus your sales and marketing efforts by identifying your target market, determining your three uniques, developing a proven process, and offering a solid guarantee. With a clear strategy and focused execution, you can achieve sustainable growth and success.

 

Identify three unique factors that set your company apart. These do not have to be different from your competitors, but the combination of the three should make you stand out. Some examples include:

- High-touch customer service 
- Investing in employees
- Client selection process

Develop a visual representation of your proven process. This helps demonstrate to prospective customers how you operate and differentiate yourself. Steps to create this include:

1. Identify 3-7 key steps in your process with your team. Give each a name.

2. Add 2-5 bullet points under each step for your salespeople to reference.

3. Give the overall process a name, like “[Company Name] Difference.”

4. Have a graphic designer create a visual based on your company branding.

5. Print and laminate the final visual.

Create a customer guarantee to address a key industry problem. This could be a service guarantee or pledge to put customers at ease and close more business. To determine your guarantee:

- Brainstorm with your team about customer frustrations and worries. 

- The guarantee should include a penalty if you fail to deliver. It must drive more business.

- Get feedback from current/prospective customers.

- List potential guarantees and choose the best option. You may need to revisit this a few times.

Develop a three-year picture to illustrate where your business will be in three years. This helps give your team a vision and guides one-year planning. The three-year picture includes:

- Measurable stats (revenue, # of employees, # of customers, etc.)

- Bullet points describing what the company will look like

- Schedule an hour meeting with leadership to discuss and build the three-year picture. Focus on the destination, not obstacles.

- Review and refine the three-year picture regularly based on changes in your vision or business.

The combination of these elements—your uniques, proven process, guarantee, and three-year picture—will provide clarity and direction for your organization. Use them in your sales and marketing to differentiate yourself and grow revenue. Revisit them regularly and make adjustments as needed.

 Here is a summary of the key steps in creating your V/TO:

1. Select a future date. Choose a date within the next 3 years to envision your organization. Keeping it within a year makes it easier for people to imagine. 

2. Determine your revenue and profit goals. Come to an agreement on the numbers your organization wants to achieve. This helps ensure your leadership team shares the same vision.

3. Establish your key measurable(s). Identify 1-2 metrics that indicate the size and scope of your organization, e.g. number of clients, units sold, etc. Set a target for what this metric will be in your future vision.

4. Describe what your organization will look like. Have each leadership team member write down bullet points of what the organization will look like on your future date. Discuss and come to an agreement on the key points. Each person should also share their vision for their own role.

5. Create your one-year plan. Decide on 3-7 high-level priorities to accomplish this year to keep you on track for your 3-year vision. Make the goals specific, measurable, and attainable. Ensure you have a budget in place to support the plan.

6. Determine your quarterly rocks. Every 90 days, identify the top priorities for that quarter to achieve your one-year plan. This creates focus and traction. 

7. List your issues. Identify any obstacles, concerns or opportunities that could impact achieving your vision. Addressing issues openly and honestly is key to overcoming them.

8. Add the details to your V/TO document. Record the details of your vision, plan and key priorities in your V/TO to share with your organization. Use it to gain alignment and track your progress.

The V/TO keeps your leadership team focused on the future and priorities to achieve it. By breaking down a multi-year vision into annual plans, quarterly priorities, and addressing issues, it generates momentum to turn vision into reality.

 

- Good leaders frequently attribute their success to surrounding themselves with good people. 
- “Good people” refers to employees who share the company’s core values, thrive in its culture, and make it a better place.
- The right people in the right seats means having employees who match the company’s core values and are in roles that leverage their unique abilities.
- The People Analyzer tool helps determine who the right people are. 
- Each employee should be in a role that aligns with their skills, passion, and strengths (their “unique ability”).
- When people can utilize their unique abilities, they feel energized instead of drained, continue improving, and create value for others.

 

- The key to improvement and gaining traction is having the right people in the right seats. The right person shares your core values and operates in their Unique Ability. 
- There are two common issues:
     1) The right person in the wrong seat: This person should be moved to a seat that utilizes their Unique Ability. If there is no right seat available, you may need to let them go.
     2) The wrong person in the right seat: This person does not share your core values and is damaging your organization. You need to make the difficult decision to let them go for the greater good of the company. 
- You need tools to properly assess your people and make the right decisions:
    - The People Analyzer: Rate each person on how well they demonstrate your core values. Aim for mostly pluses, some plus/minuses, and no minuses. Set a "bar" for the minimum rating you will accept. Anyone below the bar gets three chances to improve.
    - The Three-Strike Rule: 
        - Strike One: Discuss issues and expectations, give 30 days to improve.
        - Strike Two: Discuss again, give another 30 days. 
        - Strike Three: If still no improvement, the person must go. 
- The goal is to surround yourself with 100% of the right people. While perfection is ideal, determine a realistic "bar" and hold people accountable to that standard.

In summary, evaluating and restructuring around your core values and people's Unique Abilities is key to gaining traction and achieving your vision. The tools provided help quantify and facilitate difficult people decisions to build an organization of all the right people in the right seats.

 

1. Once a company establishes core values and accountability, employees who do not fit the culture will leave, either voluntarily or through performance management. This helps ensure the right people are in the right seats.

2. The "People Analyzer" tool can be used to validate core values and identify any leadership team members who fall below the bar. These individuals should go through performance management. 

3. The leadership team should use the People Analyzer to evaluate everyone in the organization. Managers should then share the results with their direct reports.

4. The People Analyzer should be incorporated into quarterly performance reviews for all employees. Employees should also analyze their managers.

5. If there are personnel problems, the People Analyzer can help determine if it is a "right person" or "right seat" issue.

6. The "Accountability Chart" tool helps determine the right organizational structure to move a company forward. It is based on the idea that there are three major functions in any organization: sales/marketing, operations, and finance/administration.

7. All three major functions must be strong for an organization to be effective. Only one person should be accountable for each function.

8. The "integrator" role integrates the three major functions. This role is essential for organizational success. 

9. The three major functions may split into more specific functions, depending on a company's size and needs. Most companies end up with 3 to 10 major functions.

10. Some companies may have another major function that operates at a higher level than the three primary functions.

 

- Besides an integrator, there is another important role in an organization called the visionary. Visionaries are typically owners, co-owners or founders. They come up with new ideas and solutions to big problems. Integrators, on the other hand, are good at running the day-to-day operations and holding people accountable. Having a visionary and an integrator at the top of a company creates a dynamic partnership. 

- To determine the roles and structure in your organization, create an Accountability Chart. The Accountability Chart shows the major functions of the organization and the five main roles or responsibilities under each function. It also indicates who reports to whom. Construct the structure of the chart first without assigning names. Then place the right people in the right seats according to their unique abilities. About half of organizations have a visionary role.

- The visionary, integrator and leaders of the major functions make up the leadership team. The Accountability Chart clarifies each person's accountability so the leadership team can work together to meet priorities, communicate, solve issues and execute the organization's vision.

- To put the right people in the right seats, use the "GWC" filter which stands for "get it", "want it" and "capacity to do it". All three factors must be present for someone to fully perform a role. If someone does not get it, want it or have the capacity to do the job, they will not step up and fulfill their responsibility.  Leaders need people reporting to them who can take ownership of their roles.

So in summary, identify the major functions and roles in your organization using an Accountability Chart. Determine if you have a visionary role. Place the right people in the right seats according to the GWC filter. The visionary, integrator and leaders of the major functions should make up your leadership team to set priorities, communicate well and achieve your vision.

 

The key to effective delegation and elevating people in your organization is ensuring they meet three criteria:

1. Get It: They truly understand their role, the culture, systems, pace, and how the job comes together. If they don’t get it, they will never be in the right seat. 

2. Want It: They genuinely like the job and want the responsibility, not just for the money or ego. If they don’t want it, they will never provide the passion and spark needed.

3. Capacity to Do It: They have the time, mental, physical and emotional capacity to do the job well. If not, they are in over their heads.

Using these criteria, evaluate your current leadership team and be prepared for potential changes. Studies show 80% of leadership teams change in the first 2 years of implementing this type of process. This could be removing someone from the team or adding a new member. The key is accepting that change will likely happen and being willing to make tough decisions to get the right people in the right seats.

As the company grows, people need to elevate to their “Unique Ability” - the activities that they do better than 90% of the population. This means delegating and elevating so you are not spread too thin across multiple roles. Each person only has 100% capacity, so if a role requires 120% of their time, something needs to give. They need to delegate, eliminate tasks or potentially move into a single role rather than straddling two. 

When delegating, give the work to the right person in the right seat. Don’t take on their “monkeys” (problems/responsibilities) or you will end up with too many to manage and ultimately hold back the organization. Have the courage to make a leadership change if needed. It is the only way to truly elevate yourself and your company to the next level.

The summary highlights the importance of building the right leadership team, evaluating them based on strict criteria, preparing for change, delegating to the right people in the right seats, and elevating yourself and others to focus on their Unique Abilities. Following these principles will allow for maximum growth and success.

 

- Tyler Smith started Niche Retail as a one-man operation. 
- As the business grew rapidly, Tyler had to delegate responsibilities to avoid burnout. 
- He first delegated to his wife, then hired more people to handle shipping, operations, bookkeeping, etc.
- Niche Retail moved to bigger warehouses and added more leadership roles like CFO and COO.
- Tyler effectively delegated at each stage of growth, allowing the company to scale successfully. 
- An organization's structure evolves as it grows. Niche Retail's structure changed significantly over 5 years.
- When a company's growth plateaus, it often needs restructuring and sometimes terminations. This can be painful but necessary.
- To confirm your structure is effective, ask: 1) Is this the right structure for our next stage of growth? 2) Do we have the right people in the right roles? 3) Does everyone have enough time to do their jobs well?
- Growth requires accepting that not everyone will remain in the same role. Keeping poor-fitting people hurts the organization. 
- It's best to make necessary terminations swiftly, rather than drag them out. The "36 hours of pain" principle suggests short-term discomfort is better than long-term dysfunction.
- To accurately gauge your business's health and make good decisions, you need hard data, not subjective opinions. 
- A Scorecard is a tool that quantifies key results so you can monitor your business weekly, spot trends, and foresee future outcomes.
- Managing with a Scorecard leads to continuous improvement. When things are measured and monitored, they tend to improve.

 

- A scorecard is a handful of key metrics that provide a quick overview of how a business is performing. It enables managers to monitor key activities, spot trends, and make corrections quickly.

- Most organizations lack a scorecard and rely mainly on financial statements like P&L which provide data after the fact. A scorecard provides leading indicators that can be used to change the future. 

- Rudy Giuliani used a scorecard called CompStat to reduce crime in New York City. It tracked crime statistics daily and weekly so the police could respond quickly. After its success, Giuliani created a citywide scorecard called CapStat to evaluate 20 city agencies.

- The author used a scorecard to manage his $300 million company. The number of metrics depends on the business but is usually 5 to 15. They should be reviewed weekly.

- To create a scorecard:

1. Spend time with leadership and determine 5-15 metrics you need to monitor weekly. These should be activity-based, not just financial.

2. Assign accountability - determine who is responsible for each metric.

3. Set goals for each metric.

4. Prepare the scorecard template.

5. Determine who will collect the weekly data and fill in the scorecard.

6. Review the scorecard weekly to spot trends and patterns.

- Three rules of thumb:

1. Use activity-based leading indicators, not just financial numbers. Track metrics that predict future financial performance.

2. The scorecard is a proactive tool to anticipate problems, but you still need financial statements and budgets. 

3. Flag metrics that miss their goals to create focus and urgency.

- A good scorecard evolves over time as you learn. After 3 months, it should be very useful. It leads to solving problems proactively and creates accountability.

- “What gets measured gets done.” Drive metrics down to the individual level so each person has a meaningful number to guide their work.

 

- The author attended a speech by an entrepreneur with 75 employees who measured everything in his organization numerically, including giving his receptionist a '2' to represent answering the phone within two rings.
- The author implemented a similar numbering system in his own organization and with his clients, leading to successful results. 
- He cites an example from Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends & Influence People, where Charles Schwab improved productivity in an underperforming steel mill by having the workers publicly track and compete to improve their production numbers. 
- The author lists 8 advantages to giving every employee a number:

1. It provides clear communication. Numbers are objective and specific.
2. It creates accountability. Numbers provide clear expectations. 
3. Accountable people appreciate numbers. The right employees like clarity and accountability.
4. It creates clarity and commitment. When an employee agrees to achieve a number, they have real commitment.
5. It spurs competition. Public numbers inspire people to compete to improve.
6. It produces results. What gets measured gets improved. 
7. It builds teamwork. Teams work together to figure out how to achieve a target number.
8. It allows you to solve problems faster. Numbers provide concrete data to make decisions.

- The author's client Todd Sachse used numbers to improve many metrics in his organization, leading to 50% growth. 
- The author recommends using your Accountability Chart to identify which of the 5 major roles for each position can be measured numerically. For example, a project manager could be measured on completing projects on time, achieving margin goals, client satisfaction, weekly reporting timeliness, and achieving quality standards.  
- Successful companies solve their issues promptly instead of avoiding or delaying them. Problems multiply if left unaddressed, while transparency and accountability diminish them. 
- The ability to succeed depends on the ability to solve problems. Indecision and procrastination lead to failure, while prompt and thoughtful decision making leads to success.
- Leadership teams often discuss issues endlessly without resolving them, which is draining. The author presents a process for digging to the root of issues, evaluating solutions, and then deciding to keep teams moving forward with energy. The key is simply to decide, rather than delay or avoid the decision. Solving long-standing issues can be rejuvenating.

 

- It’s normal to have issues in an organization. The key is to create an environment where people feel comfortable identifying and discussing them.

- Three types of Issues Lists should exist:

1. Company-wide issues stored in the Vision/Traction Organizer. These are tackled quarterly.

2. Weekly leadership team issues. These are strategic issues discussed in leadership team meetings.

3. Departmental issues. These are discussed in weekly departmental meetings.

- To get people discussing issues openly, leadership must set the right tone. They should admit mistakes, discuss issues openly, and work together to solve them. People must know it's okay to raise issues without fear of consequences.

- The Issues Solving Track is a simple three-step process for resolving issues:

1. Identify - Determine the real underlying issue. Discuss the stated issue to uncover the root cause. This can take the most time. 

2. Discuss - Have an open conversation about the identified issue. 

3. Solve - Determine solutions and next steps to resolve the issue.

- Spending adequate time identifying the real issue is key. The stated issue is often just a symptom. You must dig deeper to find the true cause, even if it's uncomfortable. The real issue is usually related to people or processes.

- Once the real issue is identified, the discussion and solution phases typically move much faster.

 

• There are three types of issues: 1) problems to be solved; 2) information to be communicated; 3) ideas or opportunities that need feedback. Clearly identify the issue type.

• STEP 2: DISCUSS. Discuss the issue openly without judgment. Say what you need to say once. Fight for the greater good, not your own interests. Avoid tangents. 

• STEP 3: SOLVE. Make a decision as if you're going to the "Super Bowl." There are three types of resolutions: 1) Action required and issue solved; 2) Awareness and agreement; 3) More research needed.

• The 10 Commandments of Solving Issues:

1. Don't rule by consensus. Make a final decision. Consensus management doesn't work. 
2. Don't be a weenie. Have courage and resolve. 
3. Be decisive. It's better to decide than not decide.
4. Don't rely on secondhand information. Have all parties present.
5. Consider pros and cons, but don't get stuck in "analysis paralysis."
6. Once a decision is made, support it publicly. Debate privately, unite publicly. 
7. Be willing to make imperfect decisions. Waiting for perfect information leads to procrastination. 
8. Consider both long-term and short-term effects.
9. Make reversible decisions whenever possible in case of new information. 
10. Review decisions regularly and make changes as needed. Make new decisions slowly.

 Here's a summary:

1. Process is key to consistency and scalability. Everything must be consistent first before it can be improved or fined-tuned. 

2. A typical business has around 7 core processes that make up its unique system. Understanding and standardizing these processes is key.

3. You need to take a high-level view of your business from time to time to fully understand your system. When buried in the day-to-day, it's hard to see the system clearly.

4. Systemizing your business allows you to go from being reactive to proactive. You gain more control and freedom. Without systemizing, you're stuck on the "nail" - complaining but not improving.

5. In many businesses, people do their jobs inconsistently which creates huge inefficiencies. Business owners avoid uncovering these variations out of fear. But standardizing processes brings control.

6. Clarifying and honing your core processes allows you to improve quality, increase value, strengthen control, and gain more options like growth, new leadership, sale of the business, or more free time. 

7. The end result of identifying, documenting, and having everyone follow your key processes is "The Way" - your unique system and franchise prototype.

 

- The company Franklin Communities uses the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) tools thoroughly and consistently. As a result, despite being in a struggling industry, they have increasing occupancy rates over the last 4 years. 

- To systemize your organization, you need to document your core processes and ensure they are followed.

- Identify your core processes by meeting with your leadership team. Come to an agreement on what they are called and how many there are. Examples include HR processes, marketing processes, sales processes, operations processes, accounting processes, and customer retention processes.

- Once identified, document each core process following the 20/80 rule - focus on the 20% that produces 80% of the results. Keep documentation at a high level, around 2 to 10 pages. Capture the basic steps and main points, not every small detail.

- Simplify the processes as you document them. Look for ways to streamline by eliminating redundant or confusing steps. Use checklists where possible to make the processes foolproof.

- Checklists have been shown to increase consistency, quality, and repeatable results. Consider using them in your documentation.

- Reviewing and improving your core processes can uncover "traditions" that don't actually need to be done. Ask why steps are included to determine if they are still necessary. 

- The goal is to have efficient, simplified processes that can be followed to produce consistent results.  Documenting and improving your core processes is key to systemizing your organization.

 Here’s a summary:

- Simplifying and documenting core processes enables a 
business to scale and become self-sustaining. It also allows
technology to be applied efficiently. However, technology should
only be implemented if it simplifies processes and provides a good
return on investment. 

- The $45,000 mistake: The author implemented expensive custom
software that ended up not meeting the business’s needs. It’s
better to evaluate off-the-shelf options first before investing in
custom software.

- The simplified and documented processes should be compiled into
“The Company Way”, a manual that codifies the business’s
systems and procedures. This helps with training new employees
and ensuring consistency.

- “Followed by All” means that all employees adhere to the
documented processes. This requires leadership commitment and
a clear presentation of the benefits to employees. A visual model
of how the processes connect can help in convincing employees.

- Gaining traction means executing the vision. Most organizations
struggle with accountability and discipline, rating themselves
around a 4 out of 10. Gaining traction requires overcoming the
fear of discomfort that comes with increased accountability.

- “Luftmensch” means a visionary person with their head in the
clouds. While vision is important, execution is required to make the
vision a reality. The keys to gaining traction are accountability,
discipline, and execution.

 
To gain traction, you need to implement two disciplines:
1. Set specific, measurable priorities called Rocks. Limit priorities to 3 to 7.  Focus on what's most important.
2. Meet regularly in an organized fashion called the Meeting Pulse.

Before implementing these disciplines, companies experience:
- Lack of accountability and clarity. 
- Poor communication. Employees feel alone and misunderstood.
- Stagnation. Lack of progress on goals. Everything seems important so efforts are unfocused.
- Chaos. Hard to focus on priorities. Takes a long time to make decisions. Things slip through the cracks. Reactive instead of proactive.

After implementing these disciplines, companies experience:
- Accountability. Everyone knows their responsibilities, priorities, and deadlines. Working as a team. 
- Improved communication. Meetings are shorter and more focused. Employees know company direction and priorities.
- Organization. Easier to check on progress. All working toward a common goal with clarity. Can identify poor performers.
- Traction. Making progress on goals. Able to get ahead of problems. Have time to work on important things, not just reacting.

To establish Rocks:
1. List everything that needs to be done in the next 90 days. Usually 10 to 20 things. 
2. Debate and determine the top 3 to 7 priorities. Make multiple passes at the list until you have the right number of Rocks.
3. Assign accountability for each Rock. Who is responsible for ensuring it gets done?
4. Set a deadline for each Rock. When specifically does it need to be completed?
5. Re-evaluate at your next leadership team meeting. What do you need to kill, keep, or change to stay on track? 

The key is to start every 90 days with a clean slate and determine the priorities for that new period. Your Rocks are what move the company forward quarter by quarter. Focus on them above all else. It's an ongoing cycle.

In summary, gaining traction requires focusing on a few key priorities through Rocks and meeting regularly to ensure accountability through the Meeting Pulse. The result is significant progress on goals, improved organization and communication, and a proactive mindset.

 

As a result, the right ones will rise to the top.

Once the leadership team narrows the list of priorities (Rocks) for the quarter and assigns ownership, the Rocks are shared with the whole organization. This helps keep everyone focused on what really matters for the next 90 days. 

To maintain focus and accountability, an organization needs a "Meeting Pulse" - a rhythm of regular meetings. There are two types:

1. Quarterly meetings: The "90-Day World" meetings pull the leadership team together every 90 days to review priorities and progress, and set new Rocks for the next quarter. This addresses the human tendency to lose focus roughly every 90 days.

2. Weekly meetings: Shorter weekly meetings, like the "Level 10 Meeting," increase communication and accountability. Although people often complain about too many meetings, productive meetings actually save time and increase results.

The key is to establish a habit of regular meetings at multiple levels of the organization. At first, people may resist more meetings, but they soon become invaluable for gaining traction and progress. The Meeting Pulse, like a heartbeat, keeps the organization healthy, focused, and moving in the right direction.

In summary, the 90-Day World quarterly meetings and weekly Level 10 Meetings provide the Meeting Pulse that powers progress through communication, accountability, and priority-setting. With the right meeting rhythm, an organization will get more done and achieve better results.

 

- The author noticed that the leadership team would lose focus and reach disagreement within 90 days. However, by the end of the meeting they would get back on track. Sometimes they wouldn’t even remember the previous agreements. The author started keeping detailed notes and an agenda to combat this. 

- The author realized this cycle of losing and regaining focus was normal and accepted it. The solution was to have a solid agenda and process for effective quarterly meetings. Following this process is key to keeping the organization aligned and avoiding getting off track. 

- The quarterly meeting agenda includes: a segue for transitioning to working on the business; reviewing the previous quarter’s results and key metrics; reviewing the Vision/Traction Organizer (V/TO) and ensuring alignment; setting key priorities and goals (rocks) for the next quarter; discussing and resolving key issues; determining next steps; and concluding with feedback and ratings.

- It’s important to hold these meetings off-site to minimize distractions. Meetings should be a full 8 hours. The V/TO review helps get everyone on the same page, and issues are solved following the “identify, discuss, solve” process. Not all issues will be resolved, so remaining issues are added to the weekly issues list.

- In addition to quarterly meetings, annual meetings are also essential. These provide an opportunity to build team health, revisit the vision, and plan for the next year. Leadership should come prepared with a proposed budget and ideas for the next year.

- It’s human nature to lose focus after 90 days, so continual realignment through routine quarterly meetings is key to success. Some may feel the meetings aren’t needed, but they always prove valuable. The meetings get better over time with practice.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

•Annual planning agenda:

Day 1: Review previous year, SWOT analysis, team building, review/update vision and 1-year plan.
Day 2: Establish next quarter’s priorities, address key issues, determine next steps, conclude. 

•Do an exercise like “One Thing” to build team health. Ask team members to identify one key strength and one area for improvement for each person. Then have each person commit to one thing they will do differently. Follow up on these commitments each quarter.

•Review the previous year’s goals and key numbers to see what worked and didn’t work. Use this to improve going forward. 

•Update the 3-year picture and 1-year plan, including revenue/profit targets and key goals. Make sure the plan is supported by the budget. Review accountabilities.

•Get away from the office for annual planning. This helps minimize distractions and leads to more productive meetings.

•The “buildup” to the quarterly meetings leads to better preparation and more effective meetings. Pre-schedule these meetings. 

•Have a weekly meeting to review priorities, solve issues, and communicate. This helps ensure the quarterly, and ultimately annual, plan stays on track.

•Keep the planning at a high level. Don’t overthink the 1-year plan. When the vision is clear, the plan will be straightforward.

 Here's a summary:

The Level 10 Meeting Agenda is designed to keep leadership teams focused on what's most important on a weekly basis. A weekly Level 10 Meeting:

- Keeps the team focused on what's important 
- Helps spot developing problems
- Drives the team to solve problems

The agenda includes:

Segue (5 mins): Share good news and transition into the meeting. Turn off devices and change gears. 

Scorecard (5 mins): Review key metrics and identify any numbers that are off track to discuss in the Issues section. Avoid discussion here.

Rock Review (5 mins): Review quarterly priorities (Rocks) and identify any that are off track to discuss in the Issues section. Avoid discussion here.

Customer/Employee Headlines (5 mins): Share any major news or issues, good or bad. Add any issues to the Issues section. 

To-Do List (5 mins): Review and update the list of seven-day action items from the last meeting. Mark items as done or not done.

IDS - Issues Discussion and Solution (60 mins): Discuss and solve the top issues. Usually 3 to 5 issues from last week plus new issues from the current meeting (5 to 10 total). Solve issues following the Issues Solving Track. Turn solutions into to-dos.

Conclude (5 mins): Wrap up any loose ends.

The key is solving problems and driving accountability. The To-Do List and IDS section create traction by ensuring follow through on commitments. Great meetings involve passionate, intense discussion and problem-solving.

 

Intense, exhausting, and never boring—this describes a productive
meeting with open and honest discussion where everyone shares the vision
and works for the greater good. By resolving critical issues, you gain a sense 
of accomplishment.

To conclude, recap tasks and communications, get feedback, and end on
time. Meetings should be routine, start and end on time, have a consistent
agenda focused on issues, and aim for a score of 8/10. Roll meetings out to
each department.

Set quarterly meetings to set key results and review 90-day world. Meet
weekly, follow the level 10 agenda, decide who will lead and manage the
agenda. This leads to progress, resolving frustrations, the right people in the
right seats, achieving vision and potential.

Though progress isn't always obvious, stay committed. 80% mastery and a
complete system gain traction. Continually reassess and improve. The
journey never ends but the tools, vision, people, data,  issues, process, and
traction components create magic.

Check progress twice yearly. Gaps become issues, solutions become key
results and tasks. For example, redefine target market or improve vision
communication. The tools strengthen entrepreneurial organizations.

 

- The leadership team does not share the company vision and is struggling to make key decisions about the future. 
- Someone has the action item to schedule a meeting with the whole team to revisit the vision and get back on track with quarterly company meetings.

- An organizational checkup assessment shows the leadership team ranks the company 1 out of 5 (very weak) in clearly communicating a shared vision. 
- Other areas of weakness include: core values not clearly tied to hiring and reviews; lack of clarity on target market, differentiators and 10-year plan; lack of documented and followed systems and processes.
- Rolling out EOS, the leadership team should start with foundational tools like vision/traverse, accountability chart, rocks, meeting pulse, and scorecard. They should roll them out one level at a time, starting with direct reports. 
- The pace of rollout depends on the company size and current state. It can take years for large companies with many changes. The key is being patient and not forcing change too quickly.
- EOS works because it's based on human nature - 90-day world, accountability, simplified vision, metrics, core values, meetings, issue solving, single system. 
- At some point, the "click" happens where the leadership team fully understands how EOS comes together as a complete system. For one company, this happened about a year into the process.

 

- Achieving “lightbulb moments” where the team fully buys into the EOS process can take 6-36 months. But progress requires consistent hard work and follow through. 

- It’s essential to stick to the 90-day planning cycle. Missing quarterly meetings allows momentum to fade and issues to pile up. Consistency is key.

- Companies will continue hitting “ceilings” as they grow, requiring adapting the EOS tools and leadership abilities. Breaking through ceilings allows further growth.

- Bigger is not always better. It may be better to build a strong, profitable small company rather than a struggling large one. Some companies choose to stay small to maintain their vision and values.

- The EOS process brings discipline and structure, with tools to compartmentalize all operational needs from long-term vision down to short-term to-dos.

- Partners and visionary/integrator leadership pairs need “same-page meetings” to address issues, clear the air, and present a united front to employees. Without this, growth will suffer. Counseling or coaching can help, or separation if irreparable. 

- Some partners may not have the ability to handle the changes required for real growth. Separation, though difficult, may be the only option. But with work, many leadership relationships can be improved.

The key themes are discipline, consistency, leadership unity, and being willing to make difficult changes to support the vision of company growth and success. The EOS tools provide a structured framework to achieve this, but real progress requires dedication and follow through.

 

- The partnership between Jim and Tim fell apart over three coaching sessions. In the first session, it was clear their visions were incompatible. Jim wanted to maintain the status quo, while Tim wanted major changes. Jim didn’t even show up for the third session.  They agreed to part ways.

- A different partnership realized their diverging views in the first session, struggled in the second, and canceled the third. They split into two separate companies.

- An even more complicated situation involved brothers as partners who wouldn’t even meet together. The coaching ended and they didn't act on any advice.

- Fortunately, painful partner situations only occur about 5% of the time. The solution is to follow the "same page" meeting process. If that's impossible, separating is the best long-term option.

- Taking regular "clarity breaks" - time away from work to rest your mind - is important for leaders. It leads to improved problem-solving, leadership, and example-setting. Start by scheduling just one hour per week.

- When things are going well, "visionary" leaders can get distracted by "shiny stuff" outside their core focus. Two solutions: find challenging projects within your existing vision, or explore new ideas without draining resources from your core business. Separating into two companies may ultimately be the best approach.

- The journey of building a great business should be enjoyable, not just focused on the destination. Savor the lives you impact, the value you create, the challenges, and your team. Once built, you'll have more freedom. But most focus only on outcomes, not the journey. Stay focused on the journey.

- To implement EOS tools quickly, follow a specific order: vision, data, issues, process, traction, and accountability. Start with your leadership team. Don’t skip around or you won’t gain the maximum benefit. Be open to adjustments, but follow the formula.

 

The EOS Process recommends implementing 7 main tools and 12 secondary tools in a specific order to achieve the best results:

1. Accountability Chart (includes People Analyzer and GWC): Create an accountability chart to determine the right organizational structure and put the right people in the right seats. This establishes clarity on who is accountable for what. 

2. Rocks: Set key priorities and goals every 90 days. Although the first set of Rocks may only be 50% achieved, this tool builds momentum and accountability.

3. Meeting Pulse (includes IDS, Level 10 Meeting, Quarterlies, and Annuals): Implement weekly 90-minute leadership team meetings to discuss key issues and priorities. This meeting rhythm creates traction and solves problems.

4. Scorecard: Develop a scorecard to track key metrics and establish predictability and accountability. This typically takes 1-3 months to develop into a useful tool.

5. V/TO (includes Core Values, Core Focus, 10-Year Target, Marketing Strategy, Three-Year Picture, and One-Year Plan): Build your vision and plan based on the foundation of traction and accountability created in the first 4 tools. Vision work is more productive once discipline and accountability are in place.

6. Three-Step Process Documenter: Document and train the organization on core processes. This typically takes 6-12 months to fully implement. 

7. Everyone Has a Number: Give every employee key metrics and numbers to achieve to increase accountability and results. This is most effective once the first 6 tools have been implemented.

Ongoing implementation and management are required to reinforce these tools and processes. The speed of implementation depends on company size and complexity. Multiple locations will require more time and active support from leadership. The key is to fully implement the tools one level at a time.

 Here's a summary:

- Eileen Sharp and Vic Hightower founded Swan Services, a successful company, seven years ago. 
- Recently, the company has hit a ceiling and stopped growing steadily. Eileen and Vic are frustrated.
- Eileen spent the morning preparing for the quarterly executive committee meeting. She was late but rushed in, ready to apologize, as always. Only two other executives were there on time. The others trickled in, the last being Vic at 1:14 pm.  
- Eileen presented for 60 minutes, detailing troubling signs in the past five quarters:

1) Revenue growth was projected to be 14% but was only 1.5% in the prior year and flat this quarter. 
2) Profitability had decreased. Investments made after a successful year had not paid off yet. 
3) The sales team missed revenue goals in 3 of the past 5 quarters. 
4) Existing customers started leaving, which was new. 
5) Labor costs increased a lot. Swan added and upgraded people to aim for $20M in revenue in 5 years.
6) Some key employees left abruptly recently, though exit interviews didn't cite internal issues. Eileen thinks the once great culture has eroded.

- The issues were not new but the team discussed them in prior meetings, often staying late but rarely agreeing on actions.

- Eileen considered ending her partnership with Vic after what he did in the meeting but decided not to walk away from the $7M company and 35 employees they built.  

- Eileen was late to the Business Roundtable reception because of the long meeting. She remained angry at and frustrated with Vic on her drive there.

 The prevailing sense was that the primary cause of all of the issues was somehow outside of their control:

-   One quarter, the economy was to blame. The next it was the software conversion. 
-   Last quarter Vic had actually used the terms “bad mojo” and “funk” in an attempt to quantify the problem—suggesting that the company had lost its “Midas Touch.”
-   “Dwelling on all this bad news drags us down,” he had said, staring directly at Eileen. “We’ve lost our swagger and —while I know some of you will dismiss this as metaphysical mumbo-jumbo—I’m convinced we have to get that swagger back at all cost.”

At the time Eileen had taken Vic’s observation in stride. She learned long ago to ignore his constant baiting and avoid getting sucked into titanic battles over trivial matters. Instead, Eileen analyzed the situation thoroughly and carefully prepared her plan of attack for today’s meeting.

She had entered the conference room intent on staying positive and focusing on solutions to the 13 things she believed the executive committee actually could control. But first, she needed to present her mountain of evidence to convince them Swan had a right to expect more.  

Eileen methodically made her case; the data was irrefutable. Despite a larger budget, Swan’s marketing efforts had produced fewer qualified leads. The sales team’s close-ratio had declined and it had more frequently offered discounted pricing on the deals it had won. In Operations, revenues per employee had fallen while errors and missed deadlines were up.  

As she walked through the troubling details, Eileen saw the mood in the conference room change. Arms were uncrossed. Heads began to nod. Notes were taken. Near the end of her presentation, Vic pushed himself away from the conference table and held his hands up dramatically, as though he had eaten too much at Thanksgiving dinner.“No mas, boss,” he said with a smile. “We get it.”  

When the laughter subsided, Eileen suggested the team take a quick break and return ready to start solving problems. In high spirits, she headed for the ladies’ room. That’s where a nightmare scenario began to unfold.  

Eileen heard someone slide quickly into the restroom before the swinging door closed behind her.  

“Um, Eileen?”  

“Yes, Sue—what is it?” said the startled leader.  

“I don’t know exactly how to say this,” she began. “So I’ll just spit it out. I think it would be best for all concerned if I left Swan, effective immediately.”
