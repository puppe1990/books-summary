 Here is a summary of the praise for Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance:

• Reviewers call the book “profoundly important,” “enlightening,” and “masterful.” It challenges the myth of innate talent and offers a new perspective on what determines success. 

• Reviewers praise Duckworth’s storytelling and her ability to illustrate complex ideas with examples and anecdotes. The book is described as “readable,” “compelling,” and “totally persuasive.”

• The book’s message, that sustained passion and perseverance—not talent alone—shape achievement, is called “empowering,” “invaluable,” and “transformative.” Reviewers say it can inspire people in all fields. 

• Educators in particular call the book “indispensable” and say it has the potential to “transform education.” The ideas around cultivating grit can shape how we raise and teach children.

• Reviewers compare the book favorably to other popular science and self-help books, calling it more “nuanced” and “eye-opening.” They say it teaches life lessons and strategies for success backed by credible research. 

• In all, reviewers express gratitude for the book’s important and inspiring message. They call it a “national treasure” and say we owe Duckworth a “great debt” for bringing these ideas to light.

The summary reinforces that reviewers found the book’s core message around passion, perseverance, and grit both persuasive and inspiring. They believe the insights can be transformative for individuals and society as a whole. The book is praised both for its storytelling and for its grounding in serious research. Reviewers express deep appreciation and admiration for what Duckworth has accomplished.

 Here is a summary:

• Admission to West Point is extremely competitive, with only about 1,200 students admitted out of an initial pool of over 14,000 applicants. Admitted students tend to be top athletes and students.

• However, about 20% of students drop out during their first summer at West Point, a rigorous 7-week training program known as “Beast Barracks.” This is surprising given how selective and accomplished the students are. 

• Psychologists have tried for decades to predict who will drop out during this initial training with little success. Neither physical fitness nor the “Whole Candidate Score” used in admissions reliably predicts attrition.

• A military psychologist named Mike Matthews had a clue to solving this riddle based on his own experience going through initial training. He found that success was more about perseverance and a “never give up” attitude than talent or ability. Those who dropped out rarely did so because they couldn’t handle the work, but because they gave up.

• In interviews, successful people across domains described similar qualities: resilience, determination, constant self-improvement, and enduring passion or purpose. Success was about talent combined with grit: perseverance and passion for long-term goals.

• The key was finding a way to measure grit. The author developed a survey measuring perseverance of effort and consistency of interests over time to capture this quality of passion and determination. The "Grit Scale" measured facets of grit in a way that predicted retention at West Point.

• Grit, not talent or fitness alone, was key to surviving and thriving at West Point. And this held implications far beyond West Point.

The key insights are that grit—defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals—was essential for success in challenging endeavors, and that it could be measured and used to predict retention and performance. Talent and ability were not enough; individuals needed the determination to persist in the face of struggle or lack of progress. The "Grit Scale" developed by the author measured this psychological trait.

 Here's a summary:

• Grit is defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals. The Grit Scale measures the extent to which a person approaches life with grit. 

• Studies found no relationship between grit and talent or aptitude. Grittier people achieved higher levels of education and job success regardless of their levels of talent.

• At West Point, grit predicted who would make it through the physically and mentally challenging introductory program ("Beast Barracks"), regardless of the cadets' scores on aptitude tests. About 70 cadets dropped out the first year and 62 the second year. Grit was the only factor that distinguished those who stayed from those who dropped out.

• In sales jobs with high turnover, grit predicted who kept their jobs. Grit was a better predictor than extroversion, emotional stability, and conscientiousness. 

• In Chicago public schools, grit predicted which students would graduate from high school. Grit was a better predictor than how much students cared about school or how conscientious they were. 

• Grittier adults achieved higher levels of education (master's, PhD, MD, JD). Grit predicted educational attainment better than talent or intelligence alone.

• For aspiring Green Berets, grit predicted who completed the demanding training and selection process. About 42% of candidates dropped out. Physical fitness and other attributes mattered but grit was still the best predictor of success.

• In the National Spelling Bee finals, grit predicted the final rankings of spellers better than verbal ability or time spent practicing. The champion speller that year ranked high in grit. While the spellers as a group were verbally talented, grit showed a wider range and was most associated with success.

• In summary, across education, workplace, military, and academic domains, grit predicts success over and beyond talent alone. While talent and other attributes are also important, grit stands alone in predicting who will achieve long-term goals in the face of challenges and setbacks.

 Here's a summary:

The author began teaching seventh-grade math in New York City and noticed that students' performance didn't always match their talent or aptitude. Some students grasped concepts quickly but didn't put in effort and didn't do well. Other students struggled at first but improved through hard work and perseverance. This showed the author that talent is not the only factor in a student's achievement. Effort and grit also matter.

The author then moved to San Francisco and began teaching at Lowell High School, a selective public school. Again, she noticed a disconnect between students' talent and their performance. Some very bright students didn't excel, while some hardworking students did very well, like David Luong. David was in the author's regular algebra class but was clearly in the wrong level. He was hungry to learn and worked very hard. The author had him transferred to the advanced class, where he continued to work hard and overcome struggles. 

The key message is that talent and aptitude are not destiny. Hard work, effort, perseverance, and grit are also essential to achievement. Success is not defined or limited by talent alone. With determination and effort, people can achieve beyond what their natural talents might predict.

The examples show that at both schools, the students who achieved the most were not always the most talented or gifted. Achievement was more closely linked to qualities like hard work, perseverance, and grit than to aptitude alone. Talent is not the only thing that matters. What you do with your talent—the effort you put in—is just as important. Success requires the ability to struggle and overcome setbacks, not just natural ease or quickness. And as a teacher, the author realized she needed to consider how to cultivate and sustain effort, not just talent.

So in summary, the key message is really about the importance of grit and perseverance, not talent alone, in achieving success. The examples from teaching illustrate how talent does not define or limit what someone can achieve with hard work and determination.

 Here is a summary:

- David was a quiet student who struggled in math in elementary school. His teachers and test scores deemed him "not ready" for advanced math classes.

- However, David worked hard and eventually took the hardest math classes in high school. He earned a perfect score on his AP Calculus exam. 

- David went on to study engineering and economics in college. He earned a PhD in mechanical engineering and now works as an engineer helping to improve engine efficiency. Despite initially being deemed not mathematically talented, David's hard work and perseverance allowed him to achieve great success in a math-intensive field.

- The author cites Francis Galton, who studied the origins of high achievement. Galton concluded that talent, zeal, and hard work were all important. Charles Darwin disagreed, believing that zeal and hard work were more important than talent for most people.

- Darwin himself was hardworking and meticulous, not supernaturally intelligent. He succeeded through diligent observation and thinking deeply about questions over long periods of time. 

- William James similarly argued that most people do not fully utilize their mental and physical resources. There is a gap between people's potential and what they actually achieve. While there are limits to human achievement, most people operate well within those limits. 

- Surveys show that Americans believe effort and hard work are more important for success than talent. However, researcher Chia-Jung Tsay found that people show an implicit bias towards "naturals" - those perceived as innately talented. Even when people claim that effort is more important, they tend to favor entrepreneurs and musicians described as "naturals."

- In sum, while we claim to value hard work and effort, we often show a "naturalness bias" that favors those we perceive as innately gifted. But in reality, diligent effort and perseverance are the keys to achievement for most people.

 Here is a summary:

- There is a bias for perceiving and preferring "naturals" - those we believe have innate talent - over "strivers" who achieve through hard work and dedication. This bias often influences the choices and opportunities we provide to others.

- Chia Chia Sun is an interesting example of this phenomenon. Her extraordinary accomplishments across music, academia, and business could be attributed either to natural giftedness or hard work and practice. Though she acknowledges having some talent, she attributes her success primarily to working extremely hard, practicing many hours a day throughout her life. 

- The consulting firm McKinsey & Company is focused on recruiting and rewarding individuals they believe have exceptional talent and intellect. They emphasize finding and retaining "A players" - the most talented people. Their interview process relies heavily on metrics like SAT scores to identify talent. 

- The author describes getting recruited to McKinsey out of college. Despite lacking business training or experience, she and other new hires were presumed to be talented enough to go through a crash course and then advise major corporations. The author questions why clients would pay exorbitant fees for advice from largely inexperienced consultants. She suggests that part of the appeal is the perception that McKinsey only hires "the best and the brightest."

- McKinsey's philosophy of aggressively promoting and rewarding the most talented while culling the least talented is outlined in their influential book "The War for Talent." Some critics argue this philosophy lacks common sense and point out that companies they highlighted as exemplars did not actually fare well after the book's publication. Enron is cited as an example of a company that followed this philosophy but ultimately failed due to a lack of oversight and controls.

- There are reasonable arguments on both sides of how much companies should focus on talent versus other attributes like hard work, experience, and temperament. An unbalanced focus on talent alone risks overlookiung other qualities that are vital to individual and organizational success. A more holistic view of skills, potential, and fit may be optimal.

 Here is a summary:

- The author argues that an excessive focus on talent can obscure the importance of effort. While talent is important, a preoccupation with it sends the wrong message that grit and other attributes don’t matter as much.

- The author shares the story of Scott Barry Kaufman, a psychologist who overcame learning disabilities and an initially low IQ score through determination and effort. Kaufman practiced cello for up to 9 hours a day and eventually earned a spot in his school’s orchestra and choir. He was rejected from Carnegie Mellon’s cognitive science program due to his low SAT scores but was admitted to the opera program, then switched to psychology, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa. 

- Like Kaufman, the author received a low IQ score as a child but was later admitted to gifted programs. She argues that while talent tests are imperfect, the focus on talent distracts from the importance of effort. Effort, she says, counts twice as much as talent.

- The author argues that when we attribute someone’s success to talent alone, we imply that everything else — including effort — does not matter as much. But in reality, “superlative performance is really a confluence of dozens of small skills or aptitudes, each one learned or acquired, and each one mundane and quotidian in isolation.” Talent is important but ordinary and accumulates through practice and perseverance. 

- The emphasis on talent can promote the idea that we are either “naturals” or “strivers” in a way that implies strivers will never reach the same heights. But this is false. With enough effort and determination, strivers can achieve extraordinary things.

- In summary, an excessive focus on talent obscures the importance of effort and perseverance. While talent is important, superlative achievement is really the aggregation of many small, ordinary skills developed over time through practice and grit. Both talent and effort are essential, but effort counts twice.

 Here is a summary:

The passage discusses the misperception that exceptional performance or “greatness” is primarily the result of talent.  The author argues that what we perceive as talent is actually the result of mundane, incremental actions and effort over time. Several examples illustrate this:

1) A study of swimmers found that those who ultimately became Olympic champions benefitted from factors like parental support, access to coaching, and hours of practice over many years. Their performance was an “accretion of mundane acts.” The minimal natural talent needed was lower than commonly assumed. 

2) Watching a practice session, the author observed Olympian Mark Spitz, then in his 30s, swimming with a world record holder in his prime. Despite his age, Spitz exhibited a majestic performance that seemed almost divine. But his mastery was earned, not given. We prefer to see excellence as magical rather than the result of effort and work.

3) The philosopher Nietzsche argued that we attribute greatness to “genius” and talent to avoid recognizing our own inadequacies and need for effort. Great things are accomplished not by the gifted but by those who zealously work and practice their craft. 

4) The author’s own graduate advisor chastised her for lacking a theory to explain human achievement. His criticism led her to realize that she needed to move beyond just recognizing that talent was not enough; she needed to develop an actual explanatory framework for how talent, effort, skill, and achievement interconnect. 

In summary, the passage highlights the human tendency to underestimate the role of effort and overattribute excellence to talent. But in-depth study of highly accomplished individuals reveals that their attainments actually reflect perseverance, practice, and a steady accumulation of small actions over time. A complete theory of achievement needs to incorporate these mundane elements rather than relying solely on the notion of giftedness. The reality is that excellence is achieved, not given. With dedicated effort, great things are possible for more people than is commonly assumed.

 Here is a summary:

- Theories are necessarily incomplete as they oversimplify complex concepts and phenomena. However, they are still useful to help us gain an understanding.

- Achievement depends on two factors according to the theory being discussed: talent and effort. Talent refers to how quickly one's skills improve when effort is applied. Achievement refers to applying those acquired skills. While opportunities and luck also matter, the theory focuses on the psychology of achievement. 

- Warren MacKenzie is an example. He has spent his entire adult life honing his craft as a potter through daily effort. This has improved his skill and allowed him to produce more and better pots. At the same time, his increased skill and effort have led to greater achievement as an artist.

- John Irving is another example. Despite facing challenges from dyslexia, he learned that consistent effort over time can overcome a lack of natural talent. Through diligent rewriting and revision, he developed his craft and has become an accomplished and prolific writer. His achievement required effort to build skill.

- Will Smith attributes his success to a strong work ethic and willingness to push himself, not an abundance of talent. Researchers have studied the willingness to endure mental and physical hardship to better understand achievement and found that some have a stronger "strength of will" to push through challenges.

- In summary, the theory argues that natural talent creates a foundation, but consistent effort is required to turn that into skill and ultimately achievement. Diligence and perseverance, not just talent, determine one's potential for success and accomplishment. While an oversimplification, this perspective provides insight into the psychology of achievement.

 Here is a summary of the key points about adulthood:

• Adulthood is a marathon, not a sprint. Success and well-being over the long run depend on perseverance and the ability to overcome challenges and setbacks.

• Early efforts and abilities can predict later success and psychological adjustment. For example, the ability to persevere on a treadmill test at age 20 correlated with well-being decades later. 

• Consistency of effort over time is key. Gritty people show up and work hard day after day. They don't give up easily in the face of obstacles or boredom.

• Developing expertise and achieving meaningful goals takes sustained effort over years. There are no shortcuts.

• Grit involves working on something you care deeply about. You stay loyal and committed to projects and pursuits that motivate and engage you.

• Talent is no substitute for the skill and achievement that come from hard work and perseverance. With effort, talent becomes skill and skill becomes achievement. 

• Many people start new pursuits with enthusiasm but then give up when the work gets hard or progress slows down. The gritty continue working hard through challenges and plateaus. 

• Passion and perseverance are more important for success and well-being than natural talent. Skill and achievement are the products of effort and practice, not just innate ability.

• Consistency of interests and the ability to persevere in a single industry or career path reflect grit. Constantly switching between unrelated pursuits is not gritty behavior.

That covers what I see as the key characteristics and factors related to grit and success over the long course of adulthood. Overall, grit - passion and perseverance for long-term goals - emerges as essential for well-being, growth, and achievement as an adult.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

• Passion and perseverance are the two components of grit. Passion refers to sustained devotion over time, not just intensity or infatuation. Perseverance refers to persisting in the face of setbacks and challenges. 

• The Grit Scale measures these two components. Most people score slightly higher on perseverance than passion. This suggests the two components are related but distinct.

• The story of journalist Jeffrey Gettleman illustrates passion as sustained devotion. His passion for East Africa developed over many years through deliberate effort. It guided him through a long journey to become the New York Times' East Africa bureau chief. 

• Passion is better thought of as a compass, not fireworks. It takes time to develop and points you in a consistent direction over the long run. Fireworks suggest short-lived intensity, while a compass guides you on a long journey.

• To develop grit, you need to cultivate both passion and perseverance. Passion motivates you and perseverance allows you to maintain effort and commitment over time. Together they can guide you to achieve long-term goals and success.

 Here’s a summary:

Many people do not have a definitive “life philosophy” or purpose that guides them. However, those who do find life becomes clearer and more purposeful.

For example, Pete Carroll, coach of the Seattle Seahawks, went through a pivotal moment where a friend urged him to develop a philosophy to guide him. He did a lot of thinking and reading, and came to the conclusion that “a clear, well-defined philosophy gives you the guidelines and boundaries that keep you on track.”  

One way to envision life philosophies and purpose is through a hierarchy of goals. At the bottom are concrete short-term goals. Higher up are more abstract, long-term goals that are ends in themselves. The very top is your “ultimate concern” or life philosophy. All the other goals derive meaning from and align with that top goal.

For example, Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver’s top goal was to “pitch the best I possibly can day after day, year after year.” This guided all his decisions and actions, even in the off-season. Although his life seemed grim, Seaver was happy because pitching was his passion and purpose. 

In contrast, lacking a clear life philosophy or aligned goals can lead to “positive fantasizing,” having many mid-level goals that lack a top purpose, or having competing goals that work at cross-purposes. The ideal is to have a unified set of aligned goals guided by a single top purpose or passion.  

As an example, Warren Buffett advised his pilot to develop a list of 25 career goals, pick the top 5 priorities, and ignore the rest. The key is to focus on what really matters rather than being distracted by too many competing goals.

Overall, having a clear and focused life philosophy or purpose, and aligning your goals to guide you there, can lead to a life of passion and meaning. Lacking this can lead to lack of direction or distracting conflicts between competing goals. The key is focusing on what really matters to you.

 Here's a summary:

The author wrote down all of her current projects and goals on lined paper. After 32 lines, she realized this exercise was helpful for gaining perspective. Most of the goals were mid-level, as people often default to that level of specificity when listing many goals. 

To prioritize, the author rated each goal from 1 to 10 based on how interesting and important it was. Multiplying these numbers gave a score from 1 to 100 for each goal. No goal scored 100 but none scored 1 either. 

The author tried to follow Warren Buffett's advice to circle a few top priorities and avoid the rest. However, she found this difficult as her goals were interrelated and served an overarching purpose of helping children. She put a few work goals in the "avoid" category.

The author argues that conventional prioritizing is not enough when one has many high-level but diverse goals. An "internal compass" is needed to determine how goals fit together. Goals should serve a common purpose. With this approach, one may not achieve fame or fortune but will make progress toward what really matters.

The author provides an example of cartoonist Roz Chast who has a 90% rejection rate, showing the need for perseverance and flexibility with lower-level goals. Higher-level goals should be rigid but lower ones should adapt to setbacks. "Improvise, adapt, overcome."

The story of cartoon editor Bob Mankoff further illustrates this. Mankoff became interested in cartooning after college but faced constant rejection. To avoid the draft, he went to grad school. He later left to pursue humor, debating between stand-up comedy and cartooning. He chose cartoons but still faced years of rejection from The New Yorker. 

Mankoff studied successful New Yorker cartoons and found the only commonality was that they surprised or delighted readers. He worked to achieve that in his own cartoons and eventually became the magazine's cartoon editor. His story shows the need to persevere toward the ultimate goal but adapt lower-level goals and strategies along the way.

 Here's a summary:

- The author cites research showing that grit, like all human traits, is influenced by both genes and experience. Grit is not determined solely by either nature or nurture.

- The author argues that grit can grow and develop. She cites research on height, which shows that while height is heritable, average heights have increased dramatically due to improved diet and healthcare. Like height, grit can be influenced by environmental and experiential factors.

- The author argues that a "growth mindset" is key to developing grit. When people believe that grit and other qualities can be developed, they are able to learn and improve. In contrast, a "fixed mindset" - the belief that qualities are fixed and unchangeable - impedes growth and development. 

- The author cites research showing that grit tends to increase with age. Life experiences, maturity, and learning from both successes and failures help people strengthen their perseverance and develop stronger passions and purpose. However, grit will not grow automatically; conscious effort and the right mindset are required.

- The author argues that grit can be cultivated through challenges, recalibration of interests and goals, and support from others. By trying new things, encountering obstacles, recalibrating in response to setbacks, and finding role models or mentors, people can strengthen their grit and achieve more of their potential. But grit will only grow when people believe it is possible.

In summary, the key message is that while genes influence grit, grit can grow and develop through conscious effort and the right mindset. Challenging experiences, recalibration, and support from others help cultivate perseverance and passion over time. But growth requires believing that change is possible.

 Here is a summary:

- Humans today are much taller than those from 150 years ago. This is largely due to improvements in nutrition, healthcare, and quality of life, not genetics. 

- Traits like grit, talent, intelligence, and personality are also influenced by both nature and nurture. Identical twin studies show that genetics accounts for some of the differences between people, but environment and experiences are also very important.

- There is no single "grit gene" or "intelligence gene." All traits are polygenic, meaning they are influenced by many genes, and genes interact with each other and the environment in complex ways.

- While heritability estimates can explain differences between people, they say nothing about changes over time. The "Flynn effect" shows that IQ scores have risen dramatically over the last century due to environmental changes, not genetics. 

- Cultural and social factors can create "virtuous cycles" that multiply the effects of small changes. For example, TV exposure fueled interest in basketball, leading more kids to play and improve, creating better competition and environments for learning. Similarly, societal demands for more abstract thinking have improved reasoning ability over time.

- Grit tends to increase with age, possibly due to differences in culture and life experiences across generations. For example, the "Greatest Generation" may have been grittier due to the cultural values and hardships they experienced growing up. 

- In summary, both nature and nurture are crucial in shaping human abilities, traits, and success. While genetics provides a foundation, environment and experience play an enormous role in how traits develop and change over time. Overall, the science shows that nurture, not nature alone, is the key to realizing human potential.

 Here is a summary:

- The author discusses two possible explanations for why grit tends to increase with age: generational changes or maturation/growth over time. Based on longitudinal studies showing how personality evolves over the lifespan, the author believes maturation is the more likely explanation. 

- As we age and gain life experiences, our personalities and grit levels change for several reasons:

1) We gain insights and learn life lessons that shape our views. For example, the author learned that being an expert is more fulfilling than being a “promising beginner” and that passion is as important as perseverance. 

2) Our circumstances change, forcing us to adapt. For example, a child may suddenly become potty trained when moving to a new preschool classroom that expects it, or a teenage girl may become punctual when getting a job with strict rules about lateness. 

3) Consequences, not lectures, spur behavior change and growth. For example, the threat of being fired motivated a teen girl to become punctual.

4) Over time, the adaptations we make become habitual and shape our identity. We “mature.”

- If you want to increase your grit, understand why you quit things. Common reasons include boredom, feeling the effort isn’t worth it, lack of importance, or self-doubt. For long-term goals, paragons of grit don’t think this way.

- Grit grows through four psychological assets that grit paragons cultivate:

1) A growth mindset about ability. Believe your talents and skills can be developed through effort.  

2) Passion for long-term goals. Have a purpose and direction that motivates you.  

3) Deliberate practice. Engage in focused, consistent efforts to improve your skills.  

4) Hope through adversity. When encountering failures and setbacks, remain optimistic about your ability to achieve your goals.

That's a high-level summary of the key reasons why grit increases with age and how you can cultivate more grit in yourself. Please let me know if you would like me to explain anything in the summary in more detail.

 Here is a summary:

• Successful and eminent people often say they love what they do. They frequently describe being passionate about their work and eager to get to it each day. 

• However, for many people, the practical necessities of earning a living and achieving financial security have to take precedence over finding personally fulfilling work. Telling young people to “follow their passion” is not always realistic advice.

• Nevertheless, research shows there are significant benefits to enjoying your work. People are much more satisfied with their jobs and lives overall when their work aligns with their personal interests. They also tend to perform better at work.

• Despite this, worldwide surveys show the vast majority of adults are “not engaged” or “actively disengaged” in their work. Very few seem to end up loving what they do for a living.

• There is a disconnect between the advice to follow your passion and the reality that most people do work they find unfulfilling. The constraints of earning a living mean people often cannot choose work that aligns with their interests.

• While passion and personal interest are ideal, for most people finding work they feel enthusiastic about has to be balanced with practical considerations. Following your interests is not always feasible or realistic for everyone.

The key ideas are:

1) Loving your work has significant benefits but is unrealistic for most people. 
2) Practical constraints usually take precedence over personal passion in choosing a job.
3) Finding work you care about should be balanced with financial necessities. 
4) There is a contradiction between the advice to follow your passion and the fact most people are unengaged in their jobs.
5) Personal interests fit with work is ideal but not always possible due to life circumstances.

 Here is a summary:

- We enjoy many things in life, but for various reasons, many of us struggle to find a career or passion that fulfills us. The author's father's eventual success and passion for his work provides a counterargument against the idea that you must find your singular passion right away. 

- The author does not believe we should stop encouraging people to follow their passions. While finding work you love is unlikely to lead to happiness and success alone, matching your work to your interests and talents improves the odds. However, most young people today struggle primarily with finding a passion in the first place, not with following it.

- The author found that most "grit paragons" she interviewed did not have a sudden epiphany about their lifelong passion. Instead, they explored many interests over years before finding the one that stuck. For example, chef Marc Vetri was also interested in music early on, and Olympic swimmer Rowdy Gaines tried out various sports before settling on swimming. Even Julia Child's first memorable meal in France led to her passion for cooking over many years, not right away.

- A Reddit user articulated the struggle many face in finding a career direction due to fleeting interests in many areas and obstacles to exploring any given path. The author's colleague Barry Schwartz believes unrealistic expectations and beliefs that you need an instant and perfect passion prevent many from developing serious career interests. Interests often develop over time by sticking with something enough to understand its depths. Finding the right career, like finding a mate, often comes from promising starts, not sudden epiphanies.

- While we don't fully understand the psychology of interests, we know interests evolve over time based on life experiences and genetics. The common idea of passion as a sudden discovery is misleading. Initial encounters with an eventual lifelong passion are just the first step in a longer journey. 

- The key message is that finding your passion and the right career is a long process that unfolds over time through exploration and experience. Unrealistic expectations of instant epiphanies and perfection must be shed. Though matching your work to your talents and interests is ideal, passion often develops over time, not right from the start. With openness and persistence, fleeting interests can turn into lifelong passions.

 Here’s a summary:

• Passion is developed over time through a process of discovery, development, and deepening. It rarely comes as an epiphany. 

• Interests emerge in childhood and adolescence, but it takes years of exploration and experiences to develop them into passions. Seventh graders are still figuring out what they like and don’t like. 

• Discovering your interests takes experimentation and interactions with the outside world. You can’t force yourself to be interested in something or will an interest into being. Often, you may not even realize you’re becoming interested in something until after the fact.

• Developing an interest into a passion requires repeated encounters and practice over time. A single inspiring experience is not enough. Support and encouragement from others is also key to helping interests thrive.

• The early stages of interest development are mostly about play, having fun, and enjoying small wins. This stage should not be rushed. Overbearing parents and teachers can erode motivation. Autonomy and choice are important. 

• Studies show that world-class achievers often developed their interests over years, beginning with a playful, exploratory stage before intensifying practice and skill development. Shortcutting this early exploratory stage can lead to injury, burnout, and lack of long-term success.

• Experts and beginners have different needs. Beginners need encouragement, freedom to explore, and small wins to develop interests. Criticsm and corrective feedback should be balanced. Rushing a beginner can kill their motivation.

• The stories of successful people like Will Shortz show how interests emerged from environments where those interests were encouraged and supported over many years. Genetics may play some role, but environment and experiences are key.

That covers the key highlights from the passage on how passions and interests are developed over the long run. Let me know if you would like me to explain anything in the summary in more detail.

 Here is a summary:

- After learning to read and write as a child, Will Shortz became fascinated by puzzle books. His mother encouraged this interest by buying him many puzzle books and helping him make and sell his first crossword puzzles. She supported his interests in many ways, eventually helping him create his own college major in “enigmatology,” the study of puzzles. 

- Jeff Bezos also had an unusually supportive and encouraging mother. She nurtured his interest in inventing and building mechanical devices as a child by frequently taking him to RadioShack to buy parts and helping him with projects like disassembling his crib. She supported his interest in science experiments in high school and college. This early support and encouragement likely contributed to his later success in starting Amazon.

- Both Shortz and Bezos have maintained their interests for decades. Shortz says “If you’re bored with puzzles, you’re bored with life.” Bezos’s lifelong interest in invention and building new technologies led him to start Amazon. Maintaining an interest for a long time requires continually finding new ways to challenge yourself and see complexity in work that others might find mundane.

- Most people's interests fade with time as novelty wears off. But "grit paragons" like Shortz, Bezos, and Jane Golden are able to maintain their interests over the long run by continuing to find new ways to expand and deepen them. Paul Silvia, an expert on interest, says interests deepen through a cycle of discovery, challenge, mastery, and feedback. Continually improving at an activity and gaining new insights into it makes the activity perpetually interesting.

- For Jane Golden, running the Mural Arts Program for over 30 years has remained interesting because every day brings new challenges, interactions, and ways to be creative. Like an artist, she is able to see complexity and nuance in her work that others might miss. Maintaining long-term interest requires this type of mindset.

The key lessons are:

1) Early support and encouragement of interests can have a lifelong impact. 
2) Maintaining passion and interest over the long run is key to high achievement and expertise. 
3) It is possible to maintain interest in an activity or pursuit for a long time by continually finding new ways to expand and deepen it.

 Here is a summary:

• Gritty people tend to practice more and more deeply than others. Early research found that grittier kids at the National Spelling Bee practiced more than less gritty competitors, which explained their better performance. 

• However, simply practicing for a long time is not enough. Some people practice for years but show little improvement and seem stuck at a mediocre level. It’s not just quantity of practice that matters but quality. 

• Gritty people demonstrate “kaizen” or continuous improvement. They continually try to excel and improve, rather than plateauing. This was evident in interviews with “grit paragons” and “mega successful” people.

• Anders Ericsson’s research shows how world-class experts develop skills over time through deliberate practice. Their skill improves gradually over years, slowing down as they become more expert. For example, the best violinists accumulated about 10,000 hours of practice over 10 years. Similar timescales were found for dancers and telegraph operators. 

• The key insight is that deliberate practice, not just accumulated experience, is key. Deliberate practice involves pushing beyond one's comfort zone, getting feedback, and concentrating on technique. Not all practice is equally useful. Gritty people engage in deliberate practice.

• Deliberate practice is challenging and tiring. It requires enduring frustration and setbacks to achieve progress. But gritty people find meaning and purpose in the process, not just the outcomes, which sustains their motivation.

• The capacity for hard work can be improved. People can build mental toughness and determination through habits like practicing delayed gratification, seeing purpose and meaning in their work, and cultivating an optimistic mindset about their ability to improve.

In summary, while grit depends on quantity of practice, quality of practice is most important. Deliberate, purposeful practice over a long timespan, with a growth mindset and habits that support resilience, is the true key to grit. Grit is not just about working hard for a fixed amount of time, but continuous progress through deliberate practice.

 Here is a summary:

• Experts log thousands of hours of deliberate practice, not just practice. Deliberate practice is focused, intentional, and aims to improve performance. 

• Experts set specific stretch goals and work intensely to achieve them. They focus on improving weaknesses, not just exercising their strengths. 

• Experts get immediate feedback and actively work to understand what they did wrong. They care more about correcting mistakes than congratulating themselves on what they did right.

• Experts continue practicing, even after mastery, to maintain and improve their skills. 

• The principles of deliberate practice apply across domains, from music and sports to business and surgery. Becoming an expert is largely about breaking down abilities into components and practicing them separately.

• A study of National Spelling Bee finalists found that grittier spellers engaged in more deliberate practice. They estimated spending more hours each week memorizing words, reviewing flashcards, and studying word origins. 

• The spelling bee champion that year, Kerry Close, had competed for five consecutive years. She likely accumulated thousands of hours of deliberate practice, focused on her weaknesses and getting feedback from coaches.

• Practice is not enough. Simply logging hours of mindless repetition will not lead to excellence. Deliberate practice—focused, intentional, aimed at improvement—is the key to developing mastery and expertise.

That covers the key highlights around deliberate practice and what we can learn from experts. The main takeaway is that practice makes perfect only if you practice in the right way. Deliberate practice, not just practice, is the mechanism by which experts emerge.

 Here is a summary:

- Kerry Close, a spelling bee champion, accumulated over 3,000 hours of spelling practice to prepare for her final competition. She studied word lists, obscure words, and read dictionaries to prepare.

- Data analysis found that grittier spellers practiced more deliberately than less gritty spellers. Deliberate practice was the best predictor of advancing in the spelling bee.

- Deliberate practice requires work outside your comfort zone and is effortful and not enjoyable. Even world-class performers can only do a few hours of deliberate practice per day due to the mental exertion. 

- Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi studied flow, an optimal state of concentration where a task feels effortless and spontaneous. Experts describe performing in a flow state. Flow seems incompatible with deliberate practice.

- Ericsson and Csikszentmihalyi debated passion and world-class performance. Ericsson argued for deliberate practice while Csikszentmihalyi argued for flow. However, the debate did not resolve whether expert performance requires effortful practice or can be effortless.

- A study surveyed thousands of adults on grit and flow. There was no evidence that grittier individuals experience less flow. Many people reported experiencing both flow and deliberate practice, suggesting they are compatible and both important for achieving expertise and excellence.

- In summary, deliberate practice and flow are not mutually exclusive. Deliberate practice is necessary to build expertise but flow can co-exist and may even facilitate deliberate practice. Both are integral parts of talent development.

The key findings are:

1) Deliberate practice is required to achieve expertise and excellence. 
2) Flow and deliberate practice are not incompatible - they can co-exist.
3) Both deliberate practice and flow seem important for developing talent and achieving high performance.

 Here's a summary:

- Diverse occupations like doctors, teachers, secretaries, waiters require grit or perseverance to develop expertise. Gritty people experience more "flow" or moments of effortless performance.

- Deliberate practice (intensive skill-building) and flow (effortless performance) are linked. Deliberate practice prepares for performance, flow allows peak performance. 

- Olympic gold medalist swimmer Rowdy Gaines didn't enjoy practice but pushed through because he loved competing and winning. Similarly, Olympic rower Mads Rasmussen said achieving results made the hard work worthwhile. Swimmer Katie Ledecky credited her record-breaking performance to hard work in practice.

- The author practiced and refined her TED talk through negative feedback and challenging rehearsals. The final performance demonstrated flow, but many rehearsals of deliberate practice preceded it. Practice isn't shown, only peak performance. 

- Deliberate practice can be frustrating and uncomfortable, but some top performers find it positive. Grittier National Spelling Bee contestants reported finding deliberate practice both more enjoyable and more effortful than other contestants. They may have learned to enjoy hard work or enjoyed the challenge. Either way, they did more deliberate practice.

- In summary, gritty, expert performance comes from doing a great deal of deliberate practice, which then enables experiences of flow or effortless performance. Deliberate practice, while often difficult, can be intrinsically rewarding for some. But flow is the peak experience of top performance.

 Here’s a summary:

• Deliberate practice—focused, effortful work aimed at improving performance—can feel rewarding, especially when there are rewards or progress is made. Some people, like Katie Ledecky, seem to inherently enjoy challenge and hard work. 

• Deliberate practice may not feel like “flow” or effortless perfection, but can be gratifying in its own right, especially when there are rewards or progress. Spelling champion Kerry Close said her most rewarding practice was breaking down difficult tasks into manageable parts and completing them.

• To get the most from deliberate practice:

1. Understand the key requirements: stretch goals, full effort and concentration, immediate feedback, and repetition with refinement. Most people do little deliberate practice, so making it a habit can help.

2. Make deliberate practice a habit by doing it at the same time and place every day. Habits and routines make hard things easier to start and stick with. Many eminent creators followed strict daily rituals and routines centered around deliberate practice.

3. Change your experience of deliberate practice. Try to embrace the challenge and learning rather than fearing mistakes and difficulty. A “total immersion” mindset, without judgment, can help make deliberate practice feel good. Infants and toddlers provide a model, as they constantly try new difficult things without embarrassment or anxiety.

The key is making deliberate practice a habit, understanding what it really requires, and adopting a mindset that reduces judgment and anxiety. Deliberate practice may never feel easy, but it can feel rewarding and meaningful. With the right approach, you can get better at getting better.

 Here is a summary:

- Interest and purpose are two sources of passion for gritty people. Purpose, the intention to contribute to the well-being of others, often develops later. 

- Many grit paragons describe their work as having a "moral imperative" to help others in some way. Their efforts have purpose and meaning beyond themselves.

- Psychologist Benjamin Bloom identified three stages of development: early years (interest), middle years (practice), and later years (purpose). Purpose comes last but lasts longest.

- There are two paths to happiness: hedonic (seeking pleasure) and eudaimonic (seeking meaning and purpose). Humans evolved with drives for both pleasure and purpose.

- A study of 16,000 adults found that grittier people tended to endorse purpose-focused statements more strongly. For example, "what I do matters to society" and "my work makes a positive difference." Purpose seems central to grit.

- In contrast, less gritty people tended to endorse more hedonic statements like "life is short - eat, drink and be merry." They focused more on pleasure and less on purpose.

- Overall, the findings suggest purpose contributes importantly to grit. While interest starts the journey, purpose helps fuel long-term passion and perseverance. The drive to contribute to others helps make challenges personally meaningful and worth overcoming.

 Here's a summary:

- The author conducted a large survey that found gritty people tend to be motivated by purpose and meaning, not just pleasure. They see their goals as connected to benefiting others.

- While gritty villains exist, the author’s research suggests gritty heroes motivated by altruistic purpose are more common. 

- People tend to see their work as either a job, a career, or a calling. Those with a calling, who see their work as personally meaningful and contributing value to society, tend to be grittier and more satisfied.

- Callings are not limited to certain types of jobs. Any job can be viewed as a job, career, or calling. What matters is whether the individual sees meaning, purpose, and connection to others in the work.

- The story of the three bricklayers illustrates how people can view the same work very differently. The first sees it as just a job, the second as a career, the third as a calling that contributes to something greater.

- The author argues that you don't find a calling, you develop one by choosing to see greater meaning and purpose in the work you do and connecting it to benefiting others. Callings are dynamic, not static.  People can shift from seeing work as a job to a career to a calling, even without changing jobs.

- The key message is that grit comes from cultivating a growth mindset and sense of purpose. You choose to see your work as meaningful and connected to contributing value to the world. This choice, not any particular occupation, is what allows people to develop a calling and sustain passion for the work they do.

The summary highlights the key themes around purpose, meaning, growth mindset, and choice in how one views work. The examples and stories illustrate these themes, showing how people can develop a calling and grit through the purpose and meaning they choose to see in their work.

 Here is a summary of the passage:

- Joe Leader initially took a job as an engineer with NYC Transit to pay off student loans. He eventually grew passionate about the work and saw it as a long-term career and calling. It took time for him to develop this passion and view of his work. 

- Similarly, it took Michael Baime years to integrate his personal interest in mindfulness with his work as a doctor. Initially, he didn't see medicine as his calling. Over time, as he realized many patients could benefit from mindfulness techniques, he developed a passion for promoting wellness through mindfulness. He eventually made it his full-time work.

- The author had a transformative experience at 21 while teaching middle school students over a summer. Though she didn't initially see it as her passion or calling, she came to realize the power of purposeful, meaningful work. She and a friend were compelled to start their own nonprofit education program because they saw the potential impact. Though they faced many obstacles, their sense of purpose gave them the motivation and perseverance to overcome them.

- In summary, developing a sense of purpose or calling in one's work often takes time and experience. Initial interests or jobs that meet basic needs can evolve into passionate pursuits, as individuals gain a deeper understanding of the impact and meaning their work can have. A sense of purpose provides motivation and conviction to persist in the face of challenges. For some, the convergence of personal interests and a desire to help others is key to finding purpose and meaning.

 Here's a summary:

The author was first inspired to pursue teaching through a summer enrichment program called Summerbridge. This led her to discover her passion for helping children reach their full potential. However, she felt unfulfilled just being a teacher and wanted to do more. She realized her calling was to use psychological science to help children thrive. 

The concepts of grit and purpose can seem conflicting but are actually independent and compatible. Having a sense of purpose involves both self-oriented motivation and other-oriented motivation. Research shows that people who have both kinds of motivation tend to perform better and show more grit.

The author interviewed many "grit paragons" who found purpose and passion in unexpected ways. For example, Aurora and Franco Fonte built a successful facilities services company through years of perseverance, motivated by a sense of responsibility to their employees and clients, not just self-interest. 

According to psychologist Bill Damon, purpose develops from: 1) discovering an initial interest or "spark"; 2) observing purposeful role models; 3) gaining awareness of a problem in the world that needs solving; and 4) believing you can make a difference. Purpose requires overcoming obstacles and setbacks to accomplish something meaningful.

Kat Cole is an example of someone who developed a strong sense of purpose. She grew up in poverty but worked hard to become the president of Cinnabon. She was inspired by her mother's example of helping others in small ways. Kat's motivation was to honor her mother's sacrifices by achieving success and using her position to help as many people as possible. Her story shows how purpose can motivate grit and drive unlikely success.

In summary, the author argues that purpose and grit reinforce each other. Having a sense of purpose beyond oneself fuels the perseverance and hard work that defines grit. Grit, in turn, makes it possible to fulfill one's sense of purpose. Together, purpose and grit can empower people to achieve unlikely success and help others in meaningful ways.

 Here is a summary:

- The author enrolled in a challenging neurobiology course in her first year of college. Although she prepared diligently for the quizzes and midterm, she performed poorly on both. 

- Her teaching assistant advised her to drop the course to avoid getting a failing grade on her transcript. She realized she was in over her head and should have started with an easier course.

- Rather than dropping the course, the author resolved to work even harder to improve. She spent all her time studying and attending office hours. On the final exam, she earned an A-, allowing her to pass the course with a C.

- This experience taught the author an important lesson about hope and grit. When faced with failure or setbacks, we have a choice: we can give up and withdraw, or resolve to work harder and improve. Developing grit depends on choosing the latter path.

The key message is that gritty people sustain hope in the face of failure or adversity. Rather than giving up, they redouble their efforts and persist. The author's experience in the neurobiology course demonstrated how hope, hard work, and perseverance can lead to success, even when the odds seem stacked against you. By choosing to study harder rather than withdraw, the author developed her ability to be gritty.

 Here is a summary:

- The author was struggling in a neurobiology class and considered dropping it, but ultimately decided to stay enrolled and work harder. Looking back, the author realizes this experience was similar to a famous psychology experiment on “learned helplessness.”

- In the 1964 experiment, dogs received uncontrollable electric shocks. Two-thirds of the dogs later failed to avoid shocks they could control, demonstrating learned helplessness. One-third of the dogs persevered and avoided the controllable shocks. 

- The author behaved like the persevering dogs, continuing to work hard in the neurobiology class despite initial failures. The experiment showed that uncontrollable suffering, not just suffering itself, can lead to hopelessness and symptoms of depression.

- The experimenter, Martin Seligman, went on to study “learned optimism.” He found that optimists and pessimists face the same amount of adversity, but optimists attribute it to temporary and specific causes, while pessimists attribute it to permanent and pervasive causes. This difference leads optimists to persevere and fare better in life.

- Seligman developed a test to distinguish optimists from pessimists based on how they explain events. Optimists tend to be less depressed and anxious, earn higher grades, live longer, have happier marriages, and be more successful in their careers. Elite swimmers who were optimists also performed better after being given false feedback about their performance.

- Grit paragons, like successful creative people, tend to explain events optimistically and see setbacks as learning opportunities. They say things like “Well, that didn’t go so well, but I guess I will just carry on.”

- Seligman’s mentor Aaron Beck questioned the Freudian view that mental illness is caused by unconscious childhood conflicts. He suggested psychiatrists could talk directly to patients about their conscious thoughts and help them develop more optimistic thinking habits. This became the basis for cognitive behavioral therapy.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key ideas and events in the selection? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 Here is a summary:

- Cognitive behavioral therapy aims to treat psychological issues by helping patients reframe negative thought patterns and adopt healthier behaviors. Research shows that with practice, people can learn optimistic ways of thinking that lead to greater well-being and success.

- A study of Teach For America teachers found that optimistic and gritty teachers were happier and more effective. Their optimistic mindset helped them persevere in the face of challenges and find solutions to help their students learn. 

- Psychologist Carol Dweck has studied optimism and perseverance. Early on, she found that children’s beliefs about failure and the nature of intelligence shaped their persistence. Those who believed intelligence was malleable and that effort mattered were more motivated after failure.

- Dweck developed the concepts of fixed mindset versus growth mindset. People with a fixed mindset believe that intelligence and talent are innate and unchanging. Those with a growth mindset believe that abilities can be developed through effort and learning. A growth mindset fosters resilience and higher achievement.

- Mindsets have been shown to influence outcomes in education, relationships, sports, and more. A growth mindset can be especially beneficial in the face of failures and setbacks. It helps people reframe obstacles as learning opportunities and persevere toward their goals.

In summary, research shows that an optimistic and growth-oriented mindset is key to grit, well-being, and success in life. With conscious effort, people can develop habits of thinking that promote perseverance and help them achieve their full potential.

 Here's a summary:

Having a growth mindset and grit—the perseverance and passion for long-term goals—are key to emotional and physical health, and have stronger, more positive social relationships with other people. 

Carol Dweck’s research shows that students with a growth mindset tend to be grittier and achieve more. Mindsets are shaped by people's experiences of success and failure, and the messages they receive about ability and effort. Promoting a growth mindset involves praising effort over talent, learning from failure, and modeling a belief in growth.

This applies in education, work, parenting, and leadership. In education, teachers who emphasize growth and effort tend to cultivate more motivated and higher-achieving students. In companies, a growth mindset is linked to greater trust, innovation, and risk-taking. As leaders and parents, modeling a growth mindset—calmly encouraging learning from mistakes—is more important than just praising effort. Recognizing and addressing mismatches between your words and reactions is key. 

Developing grit and a growth mindset is a lifelong effort. Everyone has moments of fixed mindset, so being vigilant about your mindset and reactions, learning from failures, and staying open to growth are ongoing pursuits. With practice and support, people can strengthen optimism, resilience, and achievement.

Growth and grit emerge from formative experiences, but mindsets and habits can be shifted at any point. With hard work and the right mindset, people can achieve more than others—or they themselves—ever imagined possible. The key is persevering in the belief that growth and progress are always possible.

 Here is a summary:

Bill McNabb struggled when he first joined the rowing team in college. The coach told him he had no chance of making varsity. However, Bill practiced all summer and improved dramatically. Though he was briefly promoted, the coach demoted him again when another rower recovered from injury. Despite the setbacks, Bill persevered and eventually succeeded, learning that you can’t overreact to failures and that staying optimistic pays off. 

Bill’s experience illustrates that facing difficulties and overcoming them can lead to growth and resilience. Programs like Outward Bound subject people to challenging experiences in a controlled setting and have been shown to increase confidence and optimism. However, uncontrollable adversity does not necessarily make people stronger and can, in fact, make them more vulnerable.

Research by Steve Maier found that adolescent rats who were able to control stress grew up to be less vulnerable to learned helplessness. The key is that adversity must be overcome through one’s own efforts. Just being told you can succeed is not enough. Experiencing mastery along with adversity rewires the brain. In contrast, a life filled only with uncontrollable difficulty can lead to lasting negative effects.

While too much struggle without control is debilitating, too little struggle can also be problematic. “Fragile perfects,” or high achievers who have rarely failed, may struggle when they do encounter difficulties because they have little experience overcoming setbacks. An example of the opposite, a growth-oriented and resilient student, is Kayvon Asemani. Though Kayvon faced difficulties in his first semester of college, including getting a C, he maintained an optimistic growth mindset.  

In summary, controlled exposure to adversity, especially at a young age, can build resilience and a growth mindset. But adversity without control or mastery is unhelpful and even harmful. A combination of high achievement and low exposure to struggle may produce "fragile perfects" who lack coping skills. Optimism and perseverance are key to overcoming difficulties and setbacks.

 Here’s a summary:

The author is frequently asked how to encourage grit in others, especially children. There are two common but opposing views on this:

1) Grit is developed through overcoming adversity and harsh discipline. This view suggests being very strict and critical, pushing children to succeed through punishment and high expectations. Proponents believe showing too much affection and support will prevent children from gaining grit. 

2) Grit blossoms when children are given unconditional love and support. This kinder approach focuses on lavishing children with affection, praise and nurturing their interests and passions. Proponents believe harsh discipline will backfire and undermine development of grit.

The author argues that neither extreme is correct and the best approach is a balanced combination of challenge and support. Strict or harsh discipline alone is not effective and can be counterproductive. But unconditional affection alone does not sufficiently motivate children or help them develop perseverance. The key is demanding high standards while also offering encouragement and help. This balanced and challenging yet supportive environment helps children develop grit and pursue long-term goals.

In summary, the takeaway is that "parenting for grit" means:

1) Maintaining high expectations for effort and conduct 
2) Limiting distractions and helping focus on key priorities
3) Encouraging a growth mindset through praise of effort over ability
4) Fostering perseverance through limited interruptions of challenging tasks 
5) Expressing warmth, affection and support to motivate children 

This balanced and challenging yet nurturing approach is the most effective way to cultivate grit. Harsh discipline or coddling alone will not achieve the same result. The key is demanding high standards while also offering help and encouragement.

 Here is a summary:

The author explores the debate between strict, demanding parenting versus permissive, child-centered parenting in developing grit in children. To provide evidence for the strict parenting side, the author cites the example of Steve Young, the legendary NFL quarterback, and his parents. Steve's parents, especially his father "Grit" Young, were very strict and demanding. They did not tolerate quitting and instilled a strong work ethic in Steve from an early age. However, they were also highly supportive and attuned to Steve's emotional needs. They attended all of Steve's games and Grit often made great sacrifices to make it home for the weekends to support his children. 

While Steve's parents demanded high standards, they also gave Steve their unconditional love and support. This combination of high standards and warmth nurtured grit and resilience in Steve. The author argues that this shows strict parenting and child-centered parenting do not have to be mutually exclusive. With the right balance of demands and support, parents can cultivate grit in their children.

In summary, the key points are:

1) Steve Young's parents, especially his father, were very strict and instilled a strong work ethic in him. They did not tolerate quitting.

2) However, they were also highly supportive and affectionate. They attended all of Steve's events and made sacrifices to support him. 

3) This combination of high standards and warmth nurtured grit and resilience in Steve from an early age.

4) The author argues this shows that strict and permissive parenting do not have to be mutually exclusive. The right balance of demands and support can cultivate grit in children.

5) Children have an innate desire for challenge and competence that needs unconditional support and love to develop. But disciplined practice and perseverance also need to be nurtured through high standards.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key points and arguments the author is making? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand the summary further.

 Here’s a summary:

Steve Young struggled with separation anxiety as a child and was fearful of going to school or leaving home. His parents showed him patience, love and encouragement. They did not force him into situations he wasn’t ready for, but they also didn’t give in to his fears by letting him stay home. They found a balance of tough love and support. This taught Steve resilience in the face of difficulties. 

Francesca Martinez has cerebral palsy but pursued a career in comedy against the advice of her teachers and doctors. Her parents encouraged her to follow her dreams while also instilling discipline and strong values. They gave her freedom to explore her interests but within clear boundaries. They believed in her ability to succeed on her own terms. Their unconditional love and trust in her potential gave her the self-belief to overcome obstacles.

There are a few lessons here:

1. Show patience, love and encouragement. Create an environment where your child feels heard and supported.

2. Find the right balance of tough love and nurturing support. Don’t give in to their fears but also don’t force them into situations they aren’t ready for. Help build their resilience gradually.

3. Instill strong values and discipline while also giving freedom to follow their interests. Set clear rules and boundaries but believe in their ability to succeed on their own terms.

4. Convey unconditional love and trust in their potential. This helps build their self-belief and grit to overcome difficulties and setbacks. 

5. Model the kind of perseverance and work ethic you want to see. Don’t just tell them, show them through your own actions and behavior.

In summary, these stories suggest that parenting for grit involves a combination of nurturing support, high expectations, trust in the child, modeling hard work, and belief in their potential. The key is finding the right balance for your particular child.

 Here is a summary:

• Research shows that the most effective parenting approach is one that combines supportiveness and demandingness. This is known as “authoritative” or “wise” parenting.

• Wise parents are loving and respectful towards their children, but also have high expectations and standards for them. They appreciate that children need compassion as well as limits andstructure.

• Studies find that children of wise parents tend to be more self-reliant, resilient, and successful. The benefits of this parenting approach have been found across cultures, ages, and socioeconomic groups. 

• What matters most is not the messages parents aim to send, but the messages their children actually receive. The child’s experience and interpretation are most important.

• Wise parenting encourages children to emulate their parents. Children naturally imitate their parents, but as they get older they develop the ability to reflect on and judge their parents’ example. When parents are admirable, children come to revere and pursue their interests and values.

• Many high-achieving and “gritty” individuals cite their parents as influential role models. They often develop interests and pursuits very similar to their parents.  Not all children of wise parents will be gritty, however, unless their parents also model passion, perseverance, and long-term goals. 

• To cultivate grit in your children, examine how much passion and perseverance you demonstrate in your own life. Then consider how likely it is that your parenting approach promotes your child emulating these qualities. If you show strong passion and perseverance, and encourage your child to emulate that, you are well positioned to foster grit in them.

 Here is a summary:

- It is not just parents who help develop grit in children. Teachers, mentors, and other role models also play an important role. 

- Technology entrepreneur Tobi Lütke credits his mentor Jürgen, an older programmer, with teaching him valuable skills and helping him overcome his learning disabilities. Jürgen gave Lütke difficult assignments and blunt feedback, helping him gain confidence and grit. 

- Research shows that teachers who are both demanding and supportive can have a significant impact on student outcomes. Experiments show that simply communicating high expectations to students can motivate them and improve their performance.

- Cody Coleman grew up in extreme poverty with an ill grandmother and incarcerated mother. However, his brother and a teacher named Chantel Smith saw his potential and encouraged him to aim high. With their support, Coleman developed grit and was admitted to MIT, where he found more mentors to help him succeed. 

- While parents play an important role in developing grit, teachers, mentors, and role models are also crucial in helping children build confidence, learn skills, and work to overcome difficulties. With the right kind of support and high expectations, children can develop grit and achieve at a high level even in the face of immense challenges and obstacles.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

• The author believes that extracurricular activities help build grit in children. These activities provide challenge and intrinsic motivation, with the support of a mentor. 

• Research shows that children report feeling more motivated and challenged during extracurricular activities compared to school or socializing. Extracurricular activities can provide an optimal mix of challenge and enjoyment.

• Participation in extracurricular activities is associated with positive outcomes like better grades, higher self-esteem, and lower likelihood of getting into trouble. Long-term studies show these benefits persist into adulthood.

• While moderate participation in extracurricular activities is beneficial, overscheduling children is rare. Most children have time to spare from media use and socializing for structured activities.

• Participating in extracurricular activities for longer periods, e.g. for multiple years, has added benefits like higher college graduation rates, stronger community involvement, lower unemployment, and higher income as adults. 

• The study of Warren Willingham showed that perseverance and passion for long-term pursuits were better predictors of success later in life than standardized test scores or grades alone. Following through with activities for multiple years was key.

• Examples show that grit developed through long-term extracurricular activities helped shape the lives of successful individuals. Continuous practice and improvement over seasons or years played an important role.

• The author believes all children would benefit from participating in at least one extracurricular activity of their choice for more than a year. While not overly scheduling children, these pursuits help them develop grit and skills in a motivating environment.

In summary, the key argument is that long-term participation in extracurricular activities helps children develop grit and is essential for success in life. These pursuits provide an optimal level of challenge and motivation under the guidance of a mentor. Following through with activities for multiple years yields the greatest benefits for children and society.

 Here is a summary:

The Personal Qualities Project found that a student's follow-through, or commitment to sustained effort over time in various activities, was the strongest predictor of success later in life, more so than standardized test scores or family background. The lead researcher, Willingham, followed thousands of students for 5 years. At the beginning, he collected information on over 100 personal characteristics. He then measured the students' success in college and later life across three areas: academic distinction, leadership, and significant accomplishments. 

Follow-through, defined as purposeful commitment to certain activities over time that led to advancement, was the top predictor of success. Students who showed high follow-through participated in two long-term extracurricular activities in high school and progressed in their roles. Those with low follow-through either did no activities or switched frequently between different ones.

Follow-through predicted graduating with honors, holding leadership roles after college, and achieving notable accomplishments across diverse areas. The specific activities themselves did not matter, only that students persistently pursued them over time and advanced in some way.

Upon learning of this research, Angela Duckworth sought to replicate the findings. With funding from the Gates Foundation, she studied 1,200 high school seniors. Like Willingham, she asked them to list their extracurricular activities, times of participation, and any achievements. Her team scored each student's "Grit Grid" from 0 to 6 based on multi-year commitment and advancement in up to two activities. 

Students with higher Grit Grid scores rated themselves as grittier, as did their teachers. Two years after high school, 34% of students were still in college. But 69% of those who scored 6 out of 6 on the Grit Grid persisted, versus only 16% of those who scored 0. A similar study of novice teachers found that those with higher college Grit Grid scores were more likely to stay teaching and to produce student gains. In contrast, teachers' SAT scores, GPAs, and leadership ratings did not predict these outcomes.

In sum, sustained passion and perseverance over long periods of time, not just talent or skills, are crucial for achievement and success. Follow-through, as demonstrated through commitment to activities, can be a useful way to measure this perseverance and predict outcomes. Both the Personal Qualities Project and Duckworth's research provide evidence for the importance of grit and follow-through.

 Here’s a summary:

-   The evidence presented so far could support two interpretations: 1) extracurriculars help develop grit or 2) gritty people chose to stick with extracurriculars. The author believes both factors are likely at play in a virtuous cycle. 
-   Personality researcher Brent Roberts found that the situations people choose tend to enhance the traits that led them there in the first place. This is known as the “corresponsive principle.” For example, agreeable teens chose higher-status jobs which then enhanced their agreeableness. 
-   The author speculates that a similar pattern could apply to grit. Struggling through challenging activities could help build grit which then leads one to take on even more challenges. Without these opportunities, a lack of follow-through could become self-reinforcing in a vicious cycle.
-   Harvard’s admissions dean, Bill Fitzsimmons, says they value evidence of commitment to meaningful pursuits, not just grades or test scores. While natural ability matters, the key is whether people build on that potential through hard work and grit. He thinks extracurriculars are not just a signal but help actively develop these qualities.    
-   However, poor students today have fewer opportunities to build grit through extracurriculars. Affluent schools and families can provide resources for activities while disadvantaged schools are cutting them. Surveys show a growing gap in participation along socioeconomic lines. 
-   Geoffrey Canada, who runs a successful program for disadvantaged youth, believes providing opportunities to overcome challenges and build grit at a young age is crucial. His program aims to give children the perseverance and optimism to overcome difficulties that might otherwise derail their progress and potential.

The key takeaway is that while natural talent and ability matter, cultivating the qualities of hard work, perseverance, and grit—especially from an early age—may be essential for realizing one’s potential and achieving meaningful goals. Both opportunities to build grit and grit itself tend to accumulate advantage, suggesting interventions to provide more equitable chances for development could be impactful.

 Here's a summary:

• Geoffrey Canada, founder of Harlem Children's Zone, believes poor children need a decent childhood with opportunities and extracurricular activities that middle-class kids get. He acknowledged there's little scientific evidence for some of these activities but said "I actually like kids."

• Psychologist Robert Eisenberger found that requiring rats and children to work hard to earn rewards made them work harder on subsequent tasks. He called this "learned industriousness." Practice and experience can teach hard work and perseverance. 

• The author found it hard to properly reward her own young daughters' hard work and perseverance. But their ballet teacher demanded high standards and grit. The girls learned diligence and passion for their craft from her.

• The author's family follows the "Hard Thing Rule." Everyone, including parents, must pursue an activity that requires daily deliberate practice. But they can quit, just not on a bad day. And they choose their "hard thing." The rule teaches grit through experience and passion for the activity.

• As her daughters get older, the rule will require them to commit to an activity for at least two years. The girls want to build grit, and they recognize the opportunity to do so.  

• The summary suggests that cultivating a "culture of grit" requires providing opportunities to work hard at meaningful activities, demanding high standards, allowing choice and passion, and teaching the value of perseverance. Support, rewards, and a growth mindset help, too.

The key elements of a culture of grit are:

1. Providing opportunities to work hard at meaningful activities 
2. Demanding high standards 
3. Allowing choice and passion
4. Teaching the value of perseverance  
5. Offering support and rewards
6. Fostering a growth mindset

 Here is a summary:

The culture in which we live shapes our identity and character in profound ways. When we join a group, we naturally conform to its norms and values. Over time, these norms and values become internalized - they shape who we are and how we think about ourselves. 

Pete Carroll, coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has built a culture that prizes grit. He actively recruits players with a “gritty” mindset, and then reinforces that mindset through training and coaching. Players come to identify as Seahawks, and to adopt the gritty attributes the culture embodies.

The sociologist Dan Chambliss has observed this dynamic in champion swimmers. At first, he thought Olympic swimmers must have extraordinary self-discipline to wake up and practice so early each day. But he came to realize that, when you are embedded in a culture where that behavior is the norm, it becomes second nature. The culture shapes the individual.

Our identity - who we believe ourselves to be - powerfully influences our choices and behaviors. Often we make important decisions not through logical cost-benefit analysis but by asking ourselves: Who am I? What does someone like me do in this situation? For example, Tom Deierlein, a West Point graduate and Airborne Ranger, attributes his grit to his identity, not any extraordinary ability. His identity has given him perseverance in the face of life-threatening challenges. 

In sum, if you want to build your grit, find a gritty culture to join. If you want to help others build grit, create a gritty culture. Culture has the power to shape identity, and identity is key to passion, perseverance, and grit.

 Here is a summary:

Tom was shot and paralyzed. Doctors told him he might never walk again. Tom was determined to prove them wrong. He worked extremely hard in physical therapy, doing all the prescribed exercises and then some. He experienced excruciating pain but persevered. After 4 months of progress, his physical therapist said he reached his maximum recovery. But Tom kept working out on his own for 8 more months. 

A year later, Tom ran the Army Ten-Miler race, finishing in under 2 hours, a goal he had set after his injury. Tom's perseverance demonstrates grit - having a goal and passion for accomplishing it despite obstacles or discouragement.  

The passage also discusses the Finnish concept of "sisu" - an inner perseverance and determination to overcome adversity. While sisu is thought of as an innate Finnish trait, studies show Finns believe it can be developed. The example of sisu shows how a culture that values qualities like perseverance and determination can promote those qualities in its members.

The passage discusses how leaders like Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, have created a culture of grit in their organizations. Dimon believes traits like determination, resolve, and learning from failures are essential for success. He has instilled those values throughout JPMorgan Chase through frequent communication and leading by example. The culture of an organization, its values and mindsets, can be shaped from the top down.

In summary, the passage discusses how grit - perseverance and passion for long-term goals - can be developed and promoted through culture. The examples of Tom, sisu, and JPMorgan Chase show how determination and persistence in the face of obstacles are qualities that can be fostered to achieve difficult goals. Strong leaders and cultures that encourage a growth mindset help to develop grit in individuals and organizations.

 Here’s a summary:

- Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, believes the most important attributes of effective leadership are “capability, character, and how they treat people.” He asks himself whether he would trust leaders to run the company without him and whether he would let his children work for them. Dimon believes in taking action and learning from mistakes, as expressed in a Teddy Roosevelt quote he often recites.  

- Anson Dorrance, the University of North Carolina women’s soccer coach, has built a successful team culture focused on grit. He has players take a grit scale survey and the Beep Test to assess their mental toughness and character. Dorrance focuses on communication and has players memorize literary quotes that represent the team’s 12 core values, like “We don’t whine.” This helps bring the values to life.

- West Point also relies on memorization to build culture, including passages like Schofield’s Definition of Discipline. However, the current superintendent notes that words alone are not enough; they must match actions. When he was a cadet, harsh hazing was common, though it contradicted the respect and discipline Schofield advocated. The culture has since improved to better reflect these ideals.

- In summary, these leaders build successful cultures through:

1) Focusing on character, values and how people are treated 
2) Embodying values through words and, especially, actions
3) Using memorization and repetition to strengthen values 
4) Continuous re-evaluation and improvement of culture

The key is that words and ideals must be truly lived and experienced for a culture to be effective. Simply reciting mottos and slogans is not enough. Culture is built through a consistent embodiment of core principles and values.

 Here is a summary:

- Forty years ago, 12% of cadets dropped out of West Point’s Beast Barracks training. Now attrition is under 2% due to eliminating hazing and a focus on developing cadets with support. 

- West Point’s Superintendent, General Caslen, says the academy now uses a “developmental model” of leadership instead of an “attrition model.” Leaders work with cadets to develop plans to meet standards instead of yelling at or intimidating them. Cadets respond better to this approach.

- Caslen gives an example of working with cadets struggling to meet physical fitness standards by creating tailored training plans and leading workout sessions with them. This boosts their motivation and confidence. 

- Other aspects of West Point like politeness, dress, and slang have not changed. Caslen believes the academy is producing even stronger leaders now. While cadets may not become notably gritty, the admissions process selects those with a growth mindset.  

- Pete Carroll, coach of the Seattle Seahawks, learned the importance of passion, vision, and perseverance in his own life. He tries to cultivate a gritty culture among players by promoting constant competition in practices and explaining the reasoning behind this approach. 

- Players like Earl Thomas demonstrate grit and push their teammates to improve. Their grit inspires more grit in others, creating a “social multiplier” effect. Thomas appreciates teammates who work hard, buy in, and continually evolve.

- The Seahawks defied odds by making two consecutive Super Bowls. After a controversial loss in the second, Carroll focused the team on their grit and resilience to come back even stronger.

 Here is a summary:

- The Seahawks were one yard away from a game-winning touchdown in the Super Bowl. Everyone expected them to run the ball with their star running back Marshawn Lynch. Instead, they passed and the ball was intercepted. They lost the Super Bowl. 

- The author visited the Seahawks to see how their culture of grit and mental toughness helped them respond to failure and find the courage to continue.

- The Seahawks culture emphasizes:

1) Language - They frequently use phrases like "Always compete", "Finish strong", "Positive self-talk", "Team first". These phrases reinforce their core values.

2) Competing means excellence, not defeating others. It means striving to be your best. 

3) Finishing strong means consistently focusing and doing your best, not just at the end. It means excellence from start to finish.

4) Their coaches and players frequently chant mantras like "No whining. No complaining. No excuses." and "Always protect the team." This reinforces their culture.

5) "Be early" means show respect, pay attention to details, and strive for excellence. 

6) Pete Carroll coaches his players the way he would coach his own children. He gives them specific advice and helps them develop plans to achieve their goals.

7) After failures like losing the Super Bowl, Pete Carroll faced it, learned from it, and used it to motivate himself and his team. 

8) Their culture and all these little details add up to building grit and resilience. 

- The author's closing thoughts:

1) You can grow grit from the inside out by developing your interests, practicing intentionally, connecting your work to purpose, and learning hope. You can also grow grit from the outside in through relationships and support from others.

2) While success and happiness are related, they are not the same. Research shows that grittier people may achieve more success, but they are not necessarily less happy. Happiness depends on other factors as well.

 Here's a summary:

The researcher found that grittier people tend to experience more positive emotions and life satisfaction. However, she acknowledges that more research is needed to explore potential downsides of grit, such as its effects on relationships and work-life balance.  

The researcher's daughters observe both the satisfactions and struggles of her gritty and hard-working nature. While they aspire to develop grit themselves, they also wish their mother would relax more at times. The researcher recognizes that too much of any trait can be problematic, though she hasn't found evidence yet that extreme grit necessarily leads to negative outcomes.

Grit is not the only virtue that matters. The researcher identifies two other clusters: interpersonal virtues like gratitude and morality, and intellectual virtues like curiosity. While grit predicts outcomes like success, other virtues are more predictive of social functioning and learning. No one virtue is uniquely important.

The researcher argues that encouraging grit does not necessarily set unrealistic expectations. Limits are often self-imposed, and grit involves sustained effort and perseverance, not achieving ultimate genius or talent. With grit, people can accomplish more than they might expect. 

The story of journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates illustrates the power of grit and perseverance. Even after facing rejection and lack of progress, he persisted and went on to achieve great success. Grit allowed him to become the kind of writer he aspired to be.

In summary, grit and perseverance are linked to well-being and enable people to achieve more than they expect, though a balanced perspective recognizes their limits and complementarity with other life virtues. Sustained effort in directions that hold personal meaning can help bring purpose and flourishing.

 Here is a summary:

The author's wife was extremely supportive during a difficult financial period early in their marriage. Even though they had a young child, the author considered driving a cab to earn money. After persevering through stressful times and finishing his book, his writing improved and became more powerful. 

In a video, the author Ta-Nehisi Coates says failure is key to his work as a writer. As a curious child growing up in Baltimore, he was particularly interested in physical safety. Journalism allows him to continue exploring questions that interest him.

Coates describes writing as a repetitive process of recognizing your "horribleness" and "terribleness" on the page, revising to make it "not so horrible and not so terrible," revising again to make it "not so bad," and eventually, if you're lucky, getting to "good." This challenging process, requiring perseverance and continuous improvement, is key to success.

The author's father used to say "you're no genius" to convey that great achievements require effort and grit, not just ability. If genius means accomplishing a lot without effort, then neither the author nor her father qualifies. But if it means working relentlessly to improve, then they, Coates, and anyone willing to put in the effort can achieve a kind of genius.

The author expresses gratitude for the team that made her book possible, including her editors, research assistant, agent, reviewers, interview subjects, friends and family who gave feedback, data visualization expert, and publishers. She also thanks her teachers and the institutions that have supported her research. Finally, she thanks her family, especially her sister, daughters, husband, and parents.

The summary highlights Coates's message about the necessity of continuous effort and failure in achieving excellence as a writer and the author's expression of gratitude for the team that helped produce her book.

 Here's a summary of the key points:

• Angela Duckworth began her studies of grit in teaching seventh graders. She noticed that grit, perseverance and passion for long-term goals, mattered more for success than talent alone. 

• Francis Galton, Charles Darwin, and William James noted the importance of perseverance and effort. However, many people continue to overemphasize the importance of talent.

• Surveys show that people are more likely to attribute success to talent rather than effort. This naturalness bias leads people to favor “naturals” over “strivers.” This can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.

• Duckworth’s research on West Point cadets, National Spelling Bee participants, and others shows that grit predicts success over and beyond talent. For example, grittier West Point cadets and salespeople were less likely to drop out. Grittier Scripps National Spelling Bee participants advanced further.

• Educational settings often focus more on talent than developing grit and perseverance. But “technical skills can flourish only with perseverance.” Grit and perseverance can be developed and are not fixed. With effort, people can grow in grit.

• Success is often attained through striving and perseverance, not natural talent alone. But the naturalness bias leads people to favor talent over effort. Recognizing the power of grit and perseverance can help address this bias. Success comes from effort and perseverance as much as talent.

The key takeaway is that while talent matters, grit and perseverance are also vital for success. But many overemphasize talent and discount the effort required. Recognizing the importance of grit can help address this naturalness bias. Success comes from effort and perseverance, not just talent alone. Developing grit and perseverance leads to higher achievement.

 Here is a summary:

The “Pygmalion Effect” refers to the phenomenon where people’s expectations influence the performance of others. Teachers’ expectations about their students’ abilities can influence students’ achievement. This highlights the importance of nurturing environments and growth mindsets. 

A “war for talent” emerged in the 1990s, focusing on discovering and developing “top talent” or “A players” in organizations. However, this approach has been critiqued as too narrowly focused on measurable talent at the expense of other qualities like character, work ethic, and perseverance. Potential is hard to judge based on metrics alone. Two examples show how initial measures of aptitude did not determine later success. Success is more determined by qualities like determination, hard work, and persistence in developing skills over time.

The “mundanity of excellence” highlights how mastery is the result of consistent practice and incremental improvement over time, not inborn talent or special gifts. Olympic swimmers achieve excellence through practicing dozens of small skills and techniques. Their success is the result of continuous effort and feedback, not magic. Similarly, the work of potter Warren MacKenzie shows how mastery is achieved through practice and persistence, not talent alone. MacKenzie has made thousands of pots over decades to achieve his level of skill. Success is rooted in continuous practice and lifelong learning, not in gifts or renaissance talents. 

In sum, qualities like work ethic, character, determination, and perseverance—not just inborn talent—are essential for success and mastery. Nurturing environments, growth mindsets, and effort over time enable human flourishing and the development of skills. Success is more mundane than magical, rooted in continuous effort and learning.

 Here is a summary of statement.pdf:

-   Successful pottery maker Warren MacKenzie believes “the most exciting things are the imperfections and irregularities.” He says making pottery is difficult and it took him 10,000 pots to become proficient.
-   Novelist John Irving grew up with an undiagnosed learning disability but through “sickening” hard work and perseverance became an accomplished storyteller and writer. He rewrites and revises his books extensively. 
-   Research on Harvard students found that persistence during challenging physical tests was linked to better mental health outcomes decades later. Will Smith attributes his success to his “sickening work ethic.” 
-   Giving up easily in the face of adversity and obstacles is linked to poor life outcomes. Eighty percent of success comes from “showing up” and persistence. Most people give up on exercise equipment, hobbies, and other endeavors too easily.
-   Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Jeffrey Gettleman showed grit by developing an interest in Africa, learning Arabic and Swahili, and building a career reporting on East Africa for the New York Times.
-   Pete Carroll, Super Bowl–winning coach of the Seattle Seahawks, built his coaching philosophy around competition, growth, and grit. He is relentlessly positive and optimistic. 
-   Goals should be organized hierarchically, with higher-level, abstract goals directing lower-level, concrete goals. Higher purpose and passion provide motivation and meaning. Baseball legend Tom Seaver showed a “mystic talent” for persistence and consistency in pursuing his goals.   
-   “Positive fantasizing” about the future without developing concrete plans and strategies is less effective than an approach balanced by consideration of obstacles and setbacks. Warren Buffett uses a “two list” strategy to identify and focus on priorities.
-   The ability to “improvise, adapt and overcome” adversity and setbacks is a key part of grit. New Yorker cartoon editor Bob Mankoff showed extraordinary persistence and determination in submitting thousands of cartoons to The New Yorker before finally being published at age forty.  
-   A study of prominent historical figures like Thomas Edison found a cluster of traits associated with success that included determination, perseverance, and hard work—key attributes of grit.

 Here is a summary:

• Follow your passion” is common advice, but interest is a better compass than passion alone. Interests are more stable and predictive of the activities and occupations that fit our values and talents. 

• People with vocational interests well matched to their jobs tend to be happier, higher performing, and longer tenured. Interest-occupation fit is beneficial across cultures and types of work. However, interests are not the only consideration in choosing a career. Practical factors like salary, job availability, and working conditions also matter.

• Interests develop over time through discovery and life experiences. They are not gifts but rather choices that combine our values, talents, and opportunities. Novelist Anthony Trollope and celebrity chef Marc Vetri are examples of gritty individuals who developed their interests through purposeful engagement. 

• A strong interest is characterized by finding an activity inherently enjoyable, personally meaningful, or both. For example, Julia Child developed a strong and lasting interest in French cooking after moving to Paris, while Olympic swimmer Rowdy Gaines discovered and cultivated his talent for swimming.

• To find and develop our interests requires not only opportunity but also deliberate practice and persistence. Experience deepens interests when we push ourselves to improve at something meaningful. Over time, through continuous effort and learning, we may develop a “strength of interest.”

• Employees describe themselves as “engaged” at work when they can pursue interests and talents on the job. High interest-occupation fit is associated with work engagement, which in turn predicts job satisfaction, performance, and retention. However, in a 2013 survey of employees in 142 countries, just 13 percent reported being engaged at work.

• In sum, following our interests is more nuanced than following our passions. Interests are shaped through effort and experience into sustaining preoccupations that fit our values and talents. They provide a compass for discovering work we find meaningful.

 Here is a summary:

Julia Child developed an interest in cooking only as an adult. As a child and young woman, she had “zero interest in the stove” and was aimless in her career pursuits. But during World War II, while in her 30s, she discovered a passion for French cooking. Stationed in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) with her husband Paul, she grew bored and dissatisfied with her job as a research assistant. On a whim, she enrolled in a class at a local cooking school. She quickly became devoted to mastering the techniques and recipes.

After the war, Julia and Paul moved to Paris, where her interest blossomed into a passion. She attended Le Cordon Bleu cooking school and was captivated by the challenges of French cooking. Every free moment was spent practicing and perfecting her craft. Through diligent practice and sheer perseverance, she overcame early failures and struggles. “No one is born a great cook,” she said. “One learns by doing.”

Julia’s passion and persistence eventually led to her pioneering first cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, published in 1961 at the age of 49. Though rejected by multiple publishers, it became a best seller and cultural phenomenon. Her subsequent TV shows introduced French cooking to American households and inspired generations to take up cooking. 

Julia’s story illustrates the development of an interest into a sustaining passion through practice and continuous improvement over the long run. Though late to find her calling, her tireless effort and deliberate practice allowed her to achieve a high level of mastery and make an enduring impact. With hard work and persistence, one can get better at almost anything. But sustaining perseverance requires an enduring interest or passion. For Julia Child, cooking became a lifelong passion by pursuing something she found captivating at first, and then dedicating herself to continued progress and learning.

In summary, Julia Child developed an interest in cooking as an adult, which grew into a passion through deliberate practice. Her persistence and perseverance in improving her craft ultimately led to mastery and lasting impact.

 Here is a summary of Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength by Roy F. Baumeister and John Tierney:

-   We all have a limited reserve of willpower that is depleted by self-control and self-regulation. Engaging in acts of willpower like resisting temptation drains this reserve. Having a purpose and meaning in our lives contributes to willpower by keeping us motivated.
-   Willpower waxes and wanes. Glucose levels in the body, blood sugar, fatigue, stress, and various physical states contribute to how much willpower we have at any given time.
-   Willpower evolved to help with short-term survival, but nowadays we use it everyday in setting and achieving long-term goals. Winning "inner battles" by resisting temptation and overriding instinctual desires, and developing self-discipline strengthen willpower.
-   Self-control and willpower can be improved through regular exercises of constraint like avoiding sweets, doing physical exercise, managing finances carefully, and maintaining good posture. People who strengthen their willpower in one area often find improvements in other areas of their lives.
-    Willpower is subject to both ego depletion and executive function fatigue. Engaging in excessive self-control or decision making depletes this reserve of mental energy, but resting, rejuvenating, and refocusing can restore it.
-   Having a purpose or meaningful goal in life taps into a renewable source of willpower and motivation. People who have purpose and passion in their lives are able to push through challenges and setbacks. They find deeper reservoirs of strength and determination. 
-   Developing habits and routines minimizes the need to exert willpower for those repeated behaviors. Healthy habits provide ongoing strength and stability that propel success. But bad habits also sap our willpower. Breaking habits and addictions requires conscious effort and time.
-   Purpose, passion, and motivation come from finding meaning and a sense of service to something greater than yourself. When we tap into purpose, we gain a renewable source of determination and willpower.

 Here is a summary:

- The ability to form close social bonds with others is a fundamental human need that is crucial for longevity and reproductive success. We have a basic desire to connect with others, just as we have a need for pleasure.

- People care more about relationships and meaning in life than they do about pleasure alone. Having meaningful work—seeing one's occupation as a calling—can increase well-being and job satisfaction. A calling orientation contributes to greater meaning, engagement, and perseverance. 

- Those with a calling view their work as contributing to the greater good, which fuels motivation and grit. Survivors of trauma or loss are particularly likely to see their work as a calling and to be motivated by its prosocial impact. Developing a sense of purpose and pursuing self-transcendent goals can help cultivate meaning both at work and beyond.

- Hope involves perceiving pathways to goals, having the motivation and perseverance to traverse those paths, and believing in one's ability to get to the destinations. Learned helplessness occurs when one believes that outcomes are uncontrollable, but hope can be learned through gaining control or changing explanatory styles.

- An optimistic explanatory style—attributing bad events to temporary rather than permanent causes, specific rather than universal causes, and external rather than internal causes—is associated with greater hope, well-being, achievement, and longevity. Pessimists are at higher risk of depression, illness, and failure. Explanatory style can be measured and altered through interventions.

- Maintaining hope during difficult times involves flexible and optimistic thinking, cultivating a sense of purpose, and taking action toward one’s goals and values. With effort and support, people can gain hope.

 Here is a summary:

In 1979, Aaron Beck wrote Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders. Around the same time, Albert Ellis developed a similar approach now known as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Beck and Ellis are recognized as pioneers of CBT. 

CBT focuses on challenging negative and irrational thoughts to help alleviate psychological distress and promote behavior change. Unlike psychoanalytic therapies, CBT is typically short-term, lasting 10 to 20 sessions. CBT has been shown to be effective for many conditions, including depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and substance abuse. Studies show CBT can be longer-lasting in its effects compared to medications alone. However, some struggle with CBT’s emphasis on modifying negative self-talk, saying that their negative beliefs “feel” true, even if they know rationally they are not. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) addresses this by focusing on accepting negative thoughts without judgment while committing to positive action.

In the 1970s, Carol Dweck began studying how our beliefs about ability and intelligence influence behavior and motivation. She found that students with a “growth mindset”—the belief that ability can be developed—are grittier and more resilient than those with a “fixed mindset”—the belief that ability is innate and unchangeable. Growth mindset has since been shown to promote positive outcomes related to achievement, relationships, and health. Interventions teaching a growth mindset have had success improving academic outcomes for at-risk students.

Parenting practices have a significant influence on a child’s mindset and grit. Parents who praise their children for effort and persistence, set high expectations paired with support, encourage a “passion for stretch goals,” and model a growth mindset themselves are more likely to raise children with grit. This type of parenting helps children develop optimism, resilience, and a sense of control over their lives. In contrast, "helicopter parenting" can inadvertently handicap a child by breeding helplessness and pessimism.

Overall, grit and growth mindset are not just individual traits but also shaped profoundly by environment and experiences. By understanding this, parents, teachers, and leaders can help cultivate these life-changing psychological resources in children, employees, and society at large.

 Here is a summary:

• Steve Young endured many hardships and failures before achieving success as an NFL quarterback. His story illustrates the power of perseverance and grit. 

• Francesca Martinez, a successful British comedian, was told as a child that she would never walk or talk due to cerebral palsy. However, with the support of her parents, she persevered against the odds. Her story shows how authoritative and supportive parenting can foster grit.

• Research suggests that authoritative parenting—which combines warmth, sensitivity, and high expectations—is ideal for developing perseverance and grit in children. Parents should encourage their children's interests and passions while also holding them to high standards.

• Extracurricular activities, especially those that are challenging and engaging, are ideal for developing grit and perseverance in students. Success in demanding extracurriculars has been linked to success later in life.

• While standardized tests can predict later success, noncognitive qualities like grit may be equally if not more important. Some research suggests that grit and perseverance are better predictors of success in challenging college environments.

• Success in life is a marathon, not a sprint. Developing qualities like grit, perseverance, and sustained passion and commitment over the long run is key. Short-term goals and wins are not enough; one must have a growth mindset and be able to persist in the face of obstacles and short-term failures.

That covers the key highlights and main takeaways on grit and perseverance from the selected passages. Please let me know if you would like me to explain or expand on any part of this summary.

 Here is a summary:

The research summarized reviews a measure for quantifying grit from extracurricular activities and shows how the passion and perseverance required for long-term goals in extracurricular activities can be linked to grit. Research on novice teachers also shows a link between grit and participation in extracurricular activities. The corresponsive principle in psychology discusses how personality traits are balanced between continuity and change over the lifespan. While personality is not “set like plaster” by age 30 as previously claimed, personality becomes increasingly stable over childhood and adolescence. However, experiences and life events can still shape personality tendencies like sociability in young adulthood and beyond.  

College admissions officers value grit and see it in students who have passion for long-term goals and the perseverance to achieve them through “plain old hard work.” Extracurricular activities provide opportunities to develop grit, though participation in extracurricular activities has been dropping. Programs like the Harlem Children’s Zone aim to give children opportunities to develop skills like grit through support and opportunities.  

Research by Eisenberger shows that learned industriousness from challenging experiences can support grit development. Extracurricular activities and other challenging voluntary activities beyond childhood provide opportunities to experience setbacks and learn perseverance.  

A culture of grit values qualities like determination, tenacity, and the ability to fail and learn from failure. Examples of grit-supporting cultures include the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Amazon, the Seattle Seahawks NFL team, and the University of North Carolina women’s soccer team. These cultures use language to promote a growth mindset, create shared identities, set high expectations for effort and excellence, give frequent feedback, and frame difficulties and setbacks as learning opportunities rather than as reasons to quit. Leaders are important in establishing and promoting these cultures.

In summary, grit can continue developing over the lifespan through participation in challenging activities, learning from experience, and the influence of grit-promoting cultures and environments. Grit is linked to well-being and happiness, suggesting that too little or too much stability may be problematic. Overall, there is an opportunity to promote grit development in individuals and establish grit-supporting cultures that could benefit both individuals and society.

 Here is a summary of the article:

• Grit refers to passion and perseverance for long-term goals. Grit entails working strenuously toward challenges, maintaining effort and interest over years despite failure, adversity, and plateaus in progress.

• One paradox of grit is that individuals with differing interests, talents, and opportunities can all demonstrate high grit. While cognitive abilities matter to achievement, noncognitive factors like grit may matter more. 

• Grit increases with age. Gritty individuals tend to be resilient and optimistic. They attribute failures and setbacks to things they can influence rather than unchangeable circumstances. Gritty individuals have a “growth mindset” - they believe their abilities can be developed through effort. 

• Deliberate practice requires effort, feedback, and concentration over time to improve performance. Gritty individuals are able to sustain deliberate practice. Achieving flow and finding purpose can enable enduring passion.  

• Extracurricular activities allow kids to experience achievement and purpose. Follow-through, not just participation, is key. Access and support enable low-income children to benefit from extracurriculars. Benefits may transfer to other areas of life.

• Parenting style influences grit. An “authoritative” style with warmth, autonomy support, and structure seems ideal. Praising effort and strategies, not talent or intelligence, encourages a growth mindset. Parents’ grit may also affect their children’s grit through modeling behavior and the opportunities they provide.

• Organizational culture and leadership define purpose and values, encourage passion and growth mindsets, support deliberate practice, and foster resilience in the face of failure. Building this culture requires demanding standards, communication, and strategic allocation of resources. Competition and adversity must be balanced to optimize grit.

• In summary, grit can be cultivated by optimizing passion, perseverance, mindset, and purpose over time through the support and cultivation of environments, relationships, and deliberate practice. There is no evidence that excess grit, devoid of meaning or well-being, would be beneficial. Living a meaningful, ethical, and socially conscious life is key to cultivating grit in oneself and others.

 Here is a summary of the 251-word science article "The Secret to Raising Smart Kids" by Carol S. Dweck:

• The growth mindset—the belief that intelligence can be developed—is key to children's desire to persist in the face of challenges. Children with a fixed mindset believe intelligence is static, so they label themselves as stupid if they struggle. This impairs their motivation and resilience.

• In studies, children with a growth mindset showed more motivation and better grades over two years. They also had higher test scores. Teaching a growth mindset resulted in higher motivation and achievement. 

• Parents and teachers can cultivate a growth mindset in kids with messages like:

› Your abilities and talents can be developed with effort.
› Challenges help you grow.
› Failure is a chance to learn. 

• Other tips: Praise effort, not ability. Comment on growth and improvement, not performance. Encourage taking on challenges. Discuss people who overcame failures and achieved through perseverance.

• A growth mindset gives kids a lifelong gift of confidence in learning and resilience in the face of obstacles. This leads to motivation, hard work, and the ability to reach potential.
