The key takeaway is that limiting beliefs about money formed in childhood continue to impact our financial lives as adults negatively. Tapping is a tool to uncover, understand, and release these money blocks to build a healthier relationship with money and greater abundance.

 Here is a summary:

• Negative emotions, beliefs and vibrations interact with everything in your life and prevent you from being open to new ideas and inspiration that can lead to creating wealth. It is hard to take action toward earning more money when you have negative beliefs fighting against your desire. Without a positive mindset about the money you want, you won't feel motivated to share your vision with others who can support you. 

• Stress reduces your ability to think creatively and limits your potential. To use the Law of Attraction, you need to have a positive mindset, visualize your dreams, and believe they can happen. But it's hard to feel optimistic about more significant goals if you're focused on just getting by and paying bills. Negative emotions block your ability to attract positive outcomes.

• You can't just think about what you want, your whole mindset has to match your desire. You likely won't get it if you have doubts, fear or don't feel deserving. Instead, you'll attract people and situations that align with those feelings. The Law of Attraction picks up on both conscious and unconscious thoughts.

• To use the Law of Attraction to increase wealth, you must be specific about what you want. Most people say they want "more money" but avoid stating an exact amount. This avoidance is due to negative associations with money that cause stress, anxiety, guilt, fear of failure, and negative self-talk. 

• Everyone has blocks that create resistance to achieving goals. Bad memories, fears, doubts, criticisms, failures, etc., accumulate into resistance against having more money. Your subconscious mind strongly influences your behavior, even if your conscious mind wants something different. These blocks lead to making excuses, overspending, risky investments, procrastination and other behaviors that limit your wealth.

• Negative experiences and emotions have a more robust and longer-lasting effect than positive ones. Fear, doubt and guilt become ingrained while good feelings fade quickly. Memories of past failures can override excitement about an opportunity. Praise and motivation are often overwhelmed by beliefs that you can't succeed or pursue your dreams.

• Only 15% of your mind is conscious while 85% is subconscious. Your subconscious holds your habits, beliefs and memories and is a million times more powerful than your conscious mind. Your desire to make more money competes with subconscious programming that resists your goals. This inner conflict leads to confusion over why you behave and think the way you do about money. Clearing subconscious blocks is critical to manifesting your desires.

 Here is a summary:

- It can be frustrating when you self-saboneed to know why to take your money goals without emotional blocks and limiting beliefs hijack your ability to choose freely and achieve what you want financially. 

- This book will help you identify and release your specific money blocks through Tapping, an energy technique used to overcome limiting beliefs and emotional resistance. Tapping accesses your subconscious mind to clear the blocks keeping you from having more money.

- Tapping, or EFT, uses acupressure by tapping on acupuncture points. It has been proven to relieve conditions like PTSD, anxiety, and phobias. Tapping clears energy blocks and negative emotions tied to limiting beliefs and past events that block your desires. It calms the body's stress response, releasing resistance to success and money.

- You don't need to believe tapping will work to benefit from it. Anyone can do it, it's free, quick, and often yields fast results. Leaders like Jack Canfield, Tony Robbins, and T. Harv Eker use tapping to achieve goals effectively.  

- To do Tapping, you tap acupuncture points on your body while voicing your negative feelings and beliefs. The main points are: the karate chop point on the side of the hand; eyebrow point; side of eye; under eye; under nose; chin point; collarbone point; and under arm point. Tap with 2-4 fingers on each end while speaking. 

- Tapping rounds often start with "the setup" - tapping the karate chop point while saying, "Even though I feel [emotion], I still [positive statement]." Then continue tapping the points while expressing your feelings. The setup helps you focus on the issues, but you can tap without it. Follow the tapping scripts in this book, modifying as needed.

- Tapping allows you to choose tremendous financial success by releasing the hidden resistance that keeps the Law of Attraction from working entirely. Identifying and clearing your money blocks is critical to achieving wealth and prosperity.

 Here's a summary:

- There are five categories of money: income, savings, debt, income and wealth goals, and toxic money. 
- Income represents your earned money and indicates your ability to survive and thrive. It reflects your belief in your self-worth and value. If your confidence in your weight is low, you'll keep your income low or work hard for your money.
- Diane's story illustrates this. Although she made good money, she worked extremely long hours because she felt she had to work hard to deserve her salary. Her exhaustion and disorganization helped drag out her work time to match her belief. Recognizing this allowed her to adopt a new idea, work smarter, and become more efficient and productive in less time.
- Your income depends on your belief in your time, energy, intelligence, education, and work value. There's a balance between these factors and the amount of work needed for your income. Thinking about income triggers emotions around survival and your ability to thrive.

The key points are:
1) There are five types of money: income, savings, debt, goals, toxic 
2) Your income reflects your self-worth and value
3) Diane's story shows how beliefs and emotions about deserving your income can negatively impact you
4) Your income depends on your belief in the value of your time, skills, and work
5) Thinking of income brings up emotions around survival and thriving

Does this summary cover the key highlights? Let me know if you want me to clarify or expand on any summary part.

 Here is a summary:

Income, savings, debt, and income/wealth goals each elicit their emotional reactions and self-limiting beliefs. Understanding these dynamics gives you the power to change them.

Savings provide security and freedom of choice. Lack of savings can trigger anxiety, sadness, loss, and lack of support stemming from past traumatic experiences. Building savings leads to feeling safer and more empowered.

Debt carries the most damaging emotions - shame, failure, anxiety, fear, and sadness. It often triggers painful memories of past guilt and feelings of inadequacy. Though borrowing money is not always bad, debt usually elicits negative self-talk and beliefs. Clearing these emotions and thoughts can be tremendously liberating. 

Setting income and wealth goals reveals more negative emotions, limiting beliefs, and fears to overcome. Your current income matches your self-limiting beliefs about your worth and value. Increasing it requires transforming those beliefs.

Two examples show how clearing negative emotions and self-limiting beliefs about savings, debt, and income goals led to greater financial and personal success. Letting go of the past and reframing their experiences in a positive light gave them confidence and empowerment.

The key message is that your financial situation is deeply connected to your emotions, beliefs, and past experiences. Acknowledging and clearing them gives you the power to improve your finances.

 Here is a summary:
• To increase your income, you need to set an income goal. However, setting ambitious goals often triggers resistance and negative emotions. 
• For example, Stephanie, a web designer, felt anxious and uncomfortable setting a higher income goal for her business. She had beliefs like "It's impossible" and "I have no idea how to get there." She feared failing, being disappointed, and embarrassing herself. 
• Clearing limiting beliefs with techniques like EFT tapping helped Stephanie set a bigger goal and feel excited about achieving it.  
• "Toxic money" refers to essential income you depend on but makes you feel angry, guilty, or like a victim. For example, alimony or inheritance battles. It creates an association between money and negative emotions and can make you unable to earn money.
• Mark's inheritance battle left him broke, angry, and unable to work. Clearing his emotional blocks helped him find a job and resolve the situation.
• Recognizing the emotions triggered by different types of money—earned, windfall, debt, scarcity, toxic—is critical to transforming your financial situation. Clearing blocks in each area will impact your life, not just your money.  
• Actions are driven by feelings, not logic or good intentions. Uncovering and clearing negative emotions about money is necessary to gain control over your financial situation.  

 Here is a summary:

- Recognizing and addressing your hidden negative emotions about money is critical to improving your financial situation. These emotions largely determine how you earn, spend, and manage money. 
- An exercise to surface these emotions is to write down your current income and say aloud "It's not enough!". Note the intensity of the feelings, often anxiety, fear, sadness, shame, anger, or frustration. These emotions activate your body's stress response, which impairs your thinking and problem-solving.
- The stress response convinces your brain that you need to focus on survival, not creative thinking or planning. This causes you to avoid dealing with money issues and have a survival mindset when you do address them. Negative emotions about money can be triggered whenever you get paid, pay bills, etc. 
- Even high earners can have severe negative emotions about money that decrease well-being, like the belief that something will take it all away no matter how much you make. These emotions often come from childhood experiences.
- Negative emotions put you in a fight-or-flight state, leaving you less able to take effective action. Techniques like Tapping can help address these emotions and the underlying beliefs to improve your financial situation.

The key message is that uncovering and clearing negative emotions about money is the first step to transforming your financial situation and gaining wealth. Your feelings determine your economic reality, so gaining awareness of them and reprogramming your mindset is critical.

 Here is a summary:

Thinking negatively about your income and financial situation activates your fight-or-flight response, which blocks your ability to increase your wealth and income. Tapping helps turn off this survival mode response by reducing negative emotions like fear, anxiety, and sadness about money. As these emotions are diffused, you become open to new possibilities and have the confidence and motivation to take action to improve your financial situation.

Two examples are given of Jean and Carol, who tapped to neutralize their negative feelings about their income. After tapping, they could set a new income goal, brainstorm ideas to build their business, and take action. Their revenue increased as a result.

A tapping script is provided to help reduce negative emotions about insufficient income. You state these negative feelings while tapping on points on your body. Then another round of Tapping is suggested while saying positive affirmations about money to help shift your mindset. Measuring your emotional intensity before and after Tapping helps determine if additional games are needed.

The key message is that by releasing negative emotions and survival mode thinking about money through Tapping, you open yourself up to new ideas, inspiration and the motivation to take action to increase your wealth and abundance.

 Here is a summary:

- The author expresses openness and willingness to receive money in all its forms - cash, checks, credit cards, etc.

- The author is releasing feelings of fear, depression, shame and anger around money and allowing their authentic self to resonate with cash. 

- The author is cultivating an enjoyment and excitement for earning and receiving money. They are open to cash flowing into their life in unexpected ways.

- The author encourages the reader to notice the negative self-talk and judgments that arise about their income and money situation. These can be profoundly damaging and sabotaging. 

- The author shares the story of a workshop participant, "Bob", who struggled with negative self-judgments like "loser" and "bad father" whenever he thought about his income and money situation. This made it very difficult for him to set and achieve financial goals.

- The author encourages the reader to tap on these negative self-judgments and the complex emotions that arise from them. Although voicing these negative thoughts can be uncomfortable, Tapping can help to release their emotional charge and change one's perspective.  

- The author shares a tapping script to help the reader work through negative self-talk and self-judgments related to their income and money situation. Tapping can shift these perspectives and cultivate more positive feelings about earning and receiving money.

- In summary, the key message is that releasing negative feelings, self-talk and judgments about one's financial circumstances and relationship with money is critical to achieving greater financial freedom and abundance. Tapping and other energy-healing modalities can be beneficial for this.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

• Your feelings about money are not primarily due to your financial situation. They stem from your earliest experiences with and programming about money, usually in childhood. 

• Your "earliest money paradigm"—the patterns and experiences from early life—created a model for how you think and feel about money today. This paradigm causes you to re-create conditions that match those early feelings, whether good or bad.

• Recognizing negative childhood memories about money can be painful, but it helps you see how that early programming still triggers emotions that block wealth. Facing these memories leads to clearing them. 

• knowing you have blocks to wealth without seeing their origin can frustrate you. The exercises here help make the unconscious conscious so you gain clarity and feel empowered to improve your finances.

• Observing your parents' relationship with money as a child likely matches how you operate with cash now. Their worries, anxieties, and traumas became your model. Look for experiences of lack, excess, control, disempowerment, or avoidance regarding money.

• Specific experiences include job loss, betrayal, arguments over money, pressure to achieve for money, lack of financial education, and more. How you felt during these events shaped your current paradigm.

• Writing down all the details you remember about this money history with your parents can reveal insights into your current situation. Clearing the emotions from the past will transform how you think and feel about money now.

• Tapping helps clear the programming that created your current money paradigm, leading to "aha" moments of insight and the ability to achieve financial improvement. Recognizing where your paradigm originated is critical.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

• Your views on money are shaped by your earliest experiences with it as a child, including your parents'/caregivers' attitudes and behaviors around finances. This creates your "money paradigm."

• If your parents argued or fought over money, or felt disempowered by their financial situation, you may associate money with negative emotions like anger, fear, or lack of control. This can lead you to sabotage your own financial goals or success.

• It's common to absorb limiting beliefs from your family about money, like "We'll never get ahead" or "Money is scarce." These beliefs often persist into adulthood and limit your potential, even unconsciously. 

• You likely made unconscious "vows" as a child to fit in with and be loyal to your family's money paradigm to feel emotionally safe. This can drive you to recreate your family's financial limitations and struggles in your own life.

• You may have also made opposing vows to rebel against your family's money paradigm and achieve more financial success. But the loyalty vow can lead you to sabotage those efforts unconsciously. 

• Recognizing these dynamics from your childhood and family history can help you understand and overcome blocks to changing your money mindset and creating financial security and abundance. Releasing old vows and limiting beliefs is critical.

• Reflecting on your "money picture" from childhood, including emotions, can reveal important insights. Note details about your parents' financial attitudes and struggles and your feelings about money at the time. Look for evidence of vows you may have made.

• Comparing your money patterns now to your parents' can expose the strong influence of your family paradigm, even if you vowed not to repeat it. Breaking free requires conscious awareness and effort.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key points and suggestions in the prompt? Let me know if you want me to clarify or expand on any summary part.

 Here is a summary:

Your early family experiences with money profoundly influence your financial situation. You may have unconscious loyalty to your family's "money paradigm"—their beliefs and understandings around cash. This can limit you in unconscious ways, like:

- Fear of surpassing your family which could lead to feeling like an outsider 
- Unconsciously limiting your income to match what your family could earn
- Making an unconscious vow never to do better than your family financially

These early experiences create powerful emotional drivers and a "wealth set point" that acts like a thermostat, keeping your financial situation at a certain level. Recognizing and clearing this old paradigm is critical to gaining control of your economic life. 

Some examples:

- Doug felt guilty earning more than his hard-working father who never got rewards. He limited his income out of loyalty. 
- Victor vowed never to be like his poor, abusive father. He built wealth but sabotaged himself, recreating his father's reality. 
- Many rebels against their family paradigm but end up in the same place. They push up the "mountain" but then lose money, recreating their family's struggles.

Tapping to clear the emotions around your early money experiences helps release these limiting beliefs and sets you free to choose your financial paradigm. Recognizing these patterns is the first step. Then visualize what you want to create instead. Let go of the past and live in the present moment.

Clearing these old patterns opens up space to fill with what you want—a new empowering money paradigm. Do tapping until emotions feel neutral and calm. Honor the past but release it for your highest good. You can now create your reality.

 Here is a summary:

- Financial trauma comes from past events that dramatically negatively impacted your money, savings, credit, or all. Even if the events were not traumatic, their impact on your finances can be traumatic. 

- You have financial trauma if you look at your current financial situation (savings, debt, etc.) and feel strong negative emotions like anger, sadness, or regret over past events that impacted it. Common causes include betrayal, failed businesses, poor financial decisions, accidents, illness, etc.

- Financial trauma causes ongoing pain, and makes you feel vulnerable, untrusting and worried about the future. It makes you avoid focusing on building wealth and doubt you can improve your situation—the memories of the trauma act as evidence that life is unfair and efforts may be futile.

- Your savings account balance can reveal financial trauma. Comparing your actual and desired savings balances can bring up emotions like fear, panic, sadness or loss, and memories of traumatic events. For many, this helps uncover financial traumas they have endured.  

- The impacts of financial trauma persist long after the events, evident in your current financial situation and the emotions you feel when you examine it. Releasing the trauma through techniques like EFT can help improve your economic outlook.

Examining your savings and the emotions it elicits can reveal financial traumas from your past that negatively impact your economic life. Recognizing and releasing these traumas is essential for improving your financial well-being.

 Here's a summary:

The amount in your savings account can trigger negative emotions like fear, anxiety, sadness, and harsh self-criticism. This is often due to painful past financial experiences that still haunt you. Clearing this emotional baggage is crucial in improving your savings. 

Tapping can help neutralize the negative emotions and limiting beliefs connected to your savings account. It can help release the emotional intensity around past financial traumas so you can move on from them. This can renew your enthusiasm and willingness to save more money.

With a shift in mindset, you can become excited to build your savings. You can commit to becoming a fantastic money manager by setting clear savings goals and taking action. While earning more is essential, money management skills and the right mindset are critical to rapid savings growth.

Past financial mistakes or losses often undermine confidence in managing your own money. Rebuilding this confidence through techniques like Tapping is essential. With the heavy emotions cleared, you can start fresh and become empowered to save successfully.

In summary, your savings account balance is deeply connected to your psychology around money. Addressing negative experiences, limiting beliefs, and harsh self-talk is critical to improving your savings. Techniques like Tapping can help make the mindset shifts needed to become motivated and committed to better money management and bigger savings goals.

 Here is a summary:

The author criticizes herself for not being a great money manager. She questions her own money savvy and financial skills. She often reviews evidence that reinforces her belief that she is terrible with money. This is a criticism and assumption she has made. As a result, she needs to focus more on money management or have a financial plan. 

However, the author has now committed to improving her money management skills. She believes she is smart and can learn. She is now open to focusing on her finances and becoming a savvy money manager, possibly even a "million-dollar money manager." As she pays more attention to her savings, it will grow. She can learn from past mistakes and work toward a better financial future. She can improve and is starting now.

The author discusses tapping to clear any financial trauma, which can negatively impact one's finances, energy, and self-confidence. Voicing the traumatic event while tapping can help release stuck emotions and make the event less significant. The "movie technique" can also help process financial trauma.

The author distinguishes between good debt and bad debt. Good debt includes investments like a mortgage that can build equity and income. Bad debt, like credit cards, causes negative feelings and stress. Worrying about lousy debt creates more obligations due to negative emotions and unhealthy coping mechanisms. Bad debt also reflects a belief that one's worth and work are insufficient. Resolving debt requires inner work to address these underlying beliefs.

In summary, the author is working to overcome her self-criticism and belief that she is terrible with money. She is committed to learning money management skills to improve her financial situation. Releasing any financial trauma through Tapping can support this process. Understanding the difference between good and bad debt, and the inner beliefs reflected in bad debt, is also helpful for making financial changes. With hard work and a shift in mindset, people can become "million-dollar money managers."

 Here's a summary:
The amount of debt you have reflects your inner beliefs about your self-worth. Many people work hard but still struggle with debt because they don't believe they deserve abundance. Looking at your debt total and the emotions it brings up can help you identify harmful beliefs you hold about money and yourself. 

Common emotions around debt are fear, anxiety, panic, sadness, and shame. These emotions often cause people to avoid dealing with their debt or feel helpless to change it. Identifying and clearing these emotions with techniques like EFT tapping can help shift your mindset and open you up to new choices for paying off debt and building wealth.

The way you fill in the sentence "This debt means I'm ___________" reveals how you connect your self-worth to having debt. Many people see themselves as losers, hopeless, or not good enough because of their debt. Recognizing these beliefs and clearing the emotions behind them is important for overcoming deficits and increasing your financial well-being.

Some tips for working through emotions around debt:

•Face your total debt amount honestly. This can be hard but gives you power and determination. 

• Notice the first emotion that comes up. This is often the primary one driving your money habits.

• Tap through your negative thoughts and beliefs about yourself because of your debt. Repeat rounds until the discomfort lessens.

• Look for any memories of events that created your debt. Tap on feelings like anger, hurt or regret that linger from those experiences.

• Be gentle with yourself. The process can bring up complicated feelings but free you from guilt and shame around your debt.

• Repeat the Tapping and exercises regularly. Releasing deep-seated beliefs and emotions around money is a journey, not a one-time fix. Consistency is key.

 Here is a summary:

To transition from debt to wealth, it is necessary to:

1. Identify and clear negative emotions around money. Use tapping to uncover and release negative feelings about money that have been programmed. This could include emotions like fear, anger, sadness, or shame. Removing these feelings will make it easier to develop better money management habits.

2. Decide to improve your money management habits. Examine how you currently handle money and set concrete goals to change unproductive behaviors. Taking real action toward those goals is critical. More than just visualizing, more money is required.

3. Change how you interact with money daily. Physically handle money and pay closer attention to how you earn, spend, save and budget. Make smarter choices that align with your goals.

4. Increase your income. Maximizing your potential by stepping into your power and purpose is the most effective way to earn more. Be open to new opportunities that allow you to gain financially as you give your unique gifts to the world. Once other steps are in place, you will be better positioned to see and act on chances to boost your bottom line.

5. Use Tapping to release resistance to better money management. Tap on any barriers you have to taking control of your finances. This can help make new habits and strategies feel more natural and automatic.

The formula to build wealth is simple: income plus intelligent money management. But emotions often unconsciously drive poor financial decisions and habits. By releasing negative feelings, committing to change and taking action, you can transition from a place of debt to a place of wealth, freedom and security. The key is to handle money consciously and strategically to achieve your most important life goals and dreams.

 Here is a summary:

- It's essential to address repaying debts and managing money well. Although it may not seem exciting, it's critical to becoming wealthier.

- Tapping can help voice your commitment to a new daily way of dealing with money. This is important because repeating that you're "bad with money" makes it a reality. Tapping can help commit to being an empowered money manager. 

- Hidden agendas are attached to making more money, like proving your worth to others or finally feeling safe and secure. These agendas can derail progress if not addressed.

- To find your hidden agendas, imagine earning much more and note what you'll finally feel, know about yourself, or prove to others. Examples include feeling safe, validated, or confirming you're good enough.

- Hidden agendas create unrealistic expectations, devastation from failure, draining emotional reactions to challenges, and cycles of battle and sabotage. They stem from lifelong beliefs and processes of trying to prove your worth until you become conscious of them.

- Examples of hidden agendas include:

1. Needing to feel safe and secure, stemming from never feeling that way. This creates anxiety, overworking, and attracting people/situations that reinforce fears.

2. Needing to feel validated and prove self-worth, stemming from never feeling good enough. This creates trying too hard to please others, feeling hurt by criticism, and attracting critical people.

- The key is acknowledging real needs for security and validation, then meeting them yourself instead of attaching them to goals. This frees you to pursue plans for the joy of achieving them rather than proving your worth.

 Here is a summary:

You have an unconscious need to prove yourself and feel validated through achieving goals, especially financial ones. This creates a cycle of setting goals to prove your worth, sabotaging them, or attracting obstacles that prevent success. The process is fueled by past experiences of feeling not good enough. 

To break this cycle, you must acknowledge the hidden agenda behind your goals and release your attachment to proving your worth through them. Then you can set goals for the right reasons - the joy of achieving them and helping others.

Reframe your goal of earning more money as an opportunity to share your gifts with more people. See how your success will benefit others. This healthier perspective will empower you to achieve your goal and break the cycle of self-sabotage.

Many avoid setting clear goals due to the following:

Fear of failure or success. Avoiding specific targets avoids potential disappointment or the unknown of significant success.

Feeling unworthy or not good enough. Believing you don't deserve your goal or can't achieve it. 

Refrain from asking for what you want. Feeling it's selfish, unrealistic or unattainable.

Lack of clarity on what you want. Vague dreams rather than specific objectives.

To overcome these resistances, acknowledge your hidden fears and attachments. Then reframe your goal around serving others through your success. This gives you motivation beyond yourself and belief in your ability to achieve your aims.

Set a clear income goal, why you want it and how you'll achieve it. Review it regularly to stay focused on your vision and maintain enthusiasm. Success is attainable when you pursue it for the right reasons!

 Here is a summary:

- Business owners work hard to achieve goals in their business but often need to set specific income goals. Setting an income goal is the most powerful step you can take.

- Setting a big goal outside your comfort zone causes resistance and uncomfortable emotions like fear and anxiety. It highlights your inner skepticism and lack of faith. Your current income reflects what you feel safe with.

- Setting a big goal illuminates your limiting beliefs keeping your income small. Using tapping to clear the resistance makes the goal exciting and motivating. 

- When you set a big goal, shift from "impossible" to "possible" thinking. Move from analytical thinking to wondering and curiosity. This unlocks creativity and inspiration. Believe anything is possible.

- Your mind has two parts: analytical/logical and imaginative/creative when you feel open to possibility without fixation on "how," the creative mind leads to quantum leaps and solutions.

- Choose between an incremental goal (one step up) or an outrageous goal (ten steps up). The shameful plan will lead to strange inspirations and require faith, but it can achieve colossal change.

- When you set an outrageous goal with excitement, exciting and unexpected things happen, sometimes called  the "Law of Attraction." Opportunities, luck, and a chance encounter lead you to the goal. 

- Be aware the outrageous goal will require a swing in thinking, action, and identity. Have faith in the process. Follow your inspirations and opportunities that arise. Take action and adapt as needed. Success will come.

- Examples show how Tapping and an outrageous goal led to a creative solution and rapid success. Getting upset is normal but can shift to excitement and possibility. The plan revealed logical steps to achieve the goal.

- Key steps: Set specific income goals. Use Tapping for resistance. Shift thinking to possible. Follow inspirations and opportunities. Have faith in the process. Take action. Success will come.

 Here is a summary:

The Law of Attraction and unexpected synchronicities often help you achieve your goals. When you get excited about a plan, reality shifts in your favor. Unexpected connections and resources appear with perfect timing to support you. This feels like coincidences or miracles. 

According to the Law of Attraction, when you become clear and excited about a goal, you become a magnet for everything needed. Various theories explain how this works. The key is that it happens when you're enthusiastic and aligned in your beliefs, emotions, expectations, and sense of deserving. Enthusiasm attracts support.

Sharing an exciting vision enrolls others to help. Circumstances, resources, and ideas come through people's networks. Opportunities become feasible when you shift from resistance to excitement about a goal and share it enthusiastically. 

For example, a business owner, John, set an income goal with the help of a coach. At first, he didn't share it with employees. They needed to know his vision to have motivation and interest in more than essential work. John worked long hours micromanaging them.

The coach helped John see how reaching his goal could benefit employees. In an open, honest speech, John shared his vision, plans, and intention for employees. The response was dramatic. Employees became captivated, motivated, and volunteered ideas. John promoted some and cut his hours. Though trying to figure out how to achieve the vision, sharing it invited innovation and focus.

There are upsides to big goals, even if uncomfortable at first. Clearing negative beliefs and voicing goals enthusiastically attracts support and miracles. Tapping transforms stress and discomfort about a plan into excitement and possibility.

To start, write your ideal income goal and say aloud "I can't achieve this goal. It's impossible!" Rate how true this feels from 1 to 10. Tap while voicing all logical resistance until it feels less accurate. Then reframe positively. Repeating this process, expressing concerns about a big goal and then reframing positively, helps shift your mindset to make the plan more believable and achievable.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- Setting a specific and ambitious income goal is essential beyond paying bills or breaking even. A solvency income goal allows you to save, invest and enjoy life. 
- To determine your income goal, list your monthly expenses including essential costs and discretionary spending on things you enjoy. Add savings contributions and any debt repayments. The total is your income goal.
- Doubling your income goal will likely bring up resistance and discomfort. This signals to limiting beliefs and fears holding you back. Address these through Tapping. 
- An outrageous income goal requires expanding your capacity for action, leadership, confidence, and finding opportunities. It propels you to grow and achieve more than you thought possible.
- Break down an outrageous goal into manageable short-term goals to make progress. Stay focused on the rewards and benefits of achieving your goal. 
- Use tapping to release resistance and negative emotions around your goal. Repeat affirmations like "I choose to have faith that I'm following my intention" and "I intend to become more me than I have ever been."

The key message is that setting challenging income goals, even ones that seem unrealistic, is necessary to improve your financial situation significantly. Work to overcome resistance and doubts by tapping and affirming your commitment to growth and purpose. With consistent action and openness to opportunities, outrageous goals can be achieved.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- Set a personal income goal to bring you joy and financial freedom. Start with a 10-year plan and work backward to 5-year and 3-year goals.
- The goals should be challenging and push you out of your comfort zone. They will trigger your limiting beliefs and resistance, which you can address through Tapping. 
- Nourish your inner entrepreneur by envisioning and dreaming about achieving your big goals. This mindset shift is necessary to achieve an ambitious goal.
- Do exercises to identify your income goal, your reasons for disbelief in achieving it, and the most significant obstacles (internal and external) standing in your way. Rate how much these obstacles frustrate you to determine where to focus your Tapping.
- Use tapping to release the negative emotions and limiting beliefs around your income goals and obstacles. Repeat until you feel more at peace with your plan.
- Align all your actions and activities with your 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year goals. Your progress will accelerate as you take consistent steps toward your vision.

The key message is to think big, set challenging income goals, and use tools like tapping to work through your mental and emotional blocks. Nurturing an entrepreneurial mindset and taking aligned action will help turn your outrageous dreams into reality.

 Here is a summary:

The author describes obstacles and frustrations blocking their progress and making them feel stuck and helpless. They are advised to take deep breaths and rate how they think about these obstacles to help diminish their importance and the negative emotions they trigger. The author is instructed to list their blocks and the feelings they evoke to establish a foundation for clearing them.

The author is told to tap on points on their body while saying phrases to help release their need to struggle against obstacles and conflicts and to choose to dissolve them for the highest good. They are told to look for new opportunities, and the barriers fade in importance as they tap. They should note how they feel about their challenges now compared to before tapping.

The author is instructed to write their big income goal on sticky notes and put them around their home to use the power of their subconscious mind. At first, this will cause discomfort, but eventually, the messages will fade into the background as the mind accepts them. The subconscious will then work to make that reality happen. Paying attention to resistance is essential. The author shares their experience using this technique and how it led to significant changes.

The author says the next step after setting a big goal is dealing with immediate external obstacles and current beliefs that keep you focused on your present reality. These include:

1. Believing the goal isn't possible. This brings up negative emotions and causes giving up.

2. Identifying someone or something as an obstacle. This brings up anger, frustration, and resentment.  

3. Believing you have shortcomings that will sabotage you. This brings up feelings of inadequacy.

4. Lacking time or energy. This makes the work to achieve the goal seems exhausting.  

5. Having financial debt. This brings up overwhelming negative emotions and makes success seem impossible.

Addressing these immediate beliefs and resistance with Tapping is critical. You have to face the views blocking you from making more money. Once you do, you can choose your truths and path.

Sometimes a big goal causes conflicts if you need to learn how to achieve it. Your analytical mind can get in the way. When a plan requires creativity and inspiration, it can take time to see how to get there.

 Here is a summary:

- Having a big, ambitious goal can feel impossible or unrealistic if you can't envision the path to achieving it. This leads to doubts, anxiety, and feelings of being overwhelmed.

- Tapping can help relieve these negative feelings and quiet your analytical mind so you can move forward with your goal. The suggested tapping script focuses on acknowledging the fears and doubts about not knowing how to achieve the goal, then reframing those thoughts into a more positive mindset of having faith that the path will become clear. 

- "Goal trauma" refers to past experiences where pursuing a goal led to disappointment, loss, failure, or other adverse outcomes. This can undermine your confidence and willingness to commit to new goals fully. Identifying goal traumas from your past and clearing them can help you approach goals with a fresh, optimistic mindset.

- The example of Arthur illustrates how a painful experience pursuing a dream can lead someone to avoid ambition and play it safe to prevent failure and loss. Tapping helped Arthur gain perspective, heal from the past, and reconnect with his ability to dream big. 

- Clearing goal trauma involves acknowledging the painful feelings and events from the past, then using tapping to release negative emotions, shift your perspective, restore confidence and trust in yourself, and open yourself up to new possibilities. This helps ensure past failures do not hold you back from future success.

The key messages are:

1) Big goals can feel overwhelming if you can't see the path to achieving them. Tapping can help.

2) "Goal trauma" from past failures can undermine your ability to commit to new goals. Identifying and clearing this trauma is essential.  

3) Releasing negative feelings from past goal pursuits, restoring self-belief, and opening up to new possibilities allows you to approach goals optimistically. 

4) Letting go of the need to control outcomes and having faith in yourself and the universe can help make big goals feel more achievable. Success comes from inspired action, not figuring everything out upfront.

 Here is a summary:

• Looking at past failures and painful events in a new, more compassionate light can help free you from their negative impact. 
• Reviewing these past events, you can now see that you learned important life lessons from them, making you wiser and better equipped to succeed. 
• Recognizing unhealthy patterns of self-criticism that you developed due to these past events is critical. Replace these with self-compassion. 
• Use Tapping to release the emotional charge from a painful past event related to a goal. Honor yourself for what you went through. See yourself as the hero of that story.
• The pain from these events often comes from not correctly grieving what you lost. Tap to release the sadness and find forgiveness for yourself. 
• Look for the gifts and lessons from the painful event. How did it make you stronger or wiser? What will you never do again? What did you learn about yourself?
• Use Tapping to build up your confidence and motivation for your current goal. Declare your desire for it and your readiness to achieve it. See it as an exciting new journey for your hero's story.
• Discovering your gifts, resilience, and inner strength from past mistakes and failures can transform how you see yourself. You can tap into them as your "superhero" powers.

 Here's a summary:

- Your income and success are limited by your inner sense of worthiness and how deserving you feel. This is called your "set point."

- Your set point governs all areas of your life - income, health, relationships, pleasure, etc. You will unconsciously sabotage progress in any location that surpasses your set point. 

- You can determine your set point by looking at your current circumstances. You are always at your set point. Look for areas that feel like they need to be balanced.

- Common signs of sabotaging progress beyond your set point include procrastination, feeling overwhelmed, inability to focus, exhaustion, anxiety, distrust in others, and spending too much time on errands and obligations. These seem random but unconsciously work to maintain your set point.

- The good news is you can raise your set point through inner work. Then your unconscious actions will support your progress rather than sabotage it.

- Ask yourself questions to determine your actual set point, like how kind you are to yourself when sick or tired, whether you feel guilty relaxing, and how loud your inner critic is. How you treat yourself reveals your set point.

- Working excessively hard is a sign your set point says you must give more to deserve more. Your earliest money experiences likely influenced your set point. 

- Unconsciously, you may create complex circumstances to justify staying at your set point, though they seem out of control. Your set point attracts the level of work and challenges that match how deserving you feel.

- Do inner work to raise your set point to achieve and sustain tremendous success and ease. Your set point is the most critical work.

 Here's a summary:

- Having a low sense of deserving causes inefficient use of time, lack of focus and creativity, and doing too much of some tasks and too little of others. 
- Questions to examine unconscious behaviors that stem from a low sense of deserving:
- Can you say no and avoid taking on more than you can handle? 
- Do you advocate for yourself and ask for what you need? 
- Do you respect your time and ask others to do the same?
- Looking at these behaviors can be uncomfortable but essential for growth. 
- The sense of deserving is tied to the Law of Attraction - if you don't fully believe you deserve something, it interferes with manifesting it.

- Pay attention to your inner self-talk - do you criticize yourself more than praise yourself? This shows your sense of deserving. 
- Feeling guilty is a sign you've gone past your current sense of deserving. The two common reactions are overdoing to relieve the guilt or rebelling, then feeling guilty. 
- To raise your sense of deserving, work on your self-belief and value, tap into your potential and talents, and value your time and skills. Ask yourself for inspiration, and it will come. 
- An exercise: Say aloud, "I deserve to earn $X" and "My skills are valuable enough to earn $X." Note how true it feels from 1-10. Look at the beliefs that come up. 
- Visualize holding up your income goal on a sign in front of everyone you know. Say, "This is what I want to earn, and I deserve it!" Note your feelings - embarrassment, fear? See their reactions. This shows your inner battle.

 Here is a summary of the main points:

- Visualizing earning a significant income and declaring you deserve it can bring up feelings of resistance, guilt, fear, and shame. This highlights limiting beliefs about your worth and value. 
- Voicing negative emotions and self-talk while tapping can help release them. You are repeating the visualization after Tapping can show how your feelings have shifted. 
- Clearing limiting beliefs often leads to gaining a new appreciation for your unique talents and potential. You have untapped resources within you.
- Asking your subconscious mind to reveal more of your untapped brilliance, inspiration, courage, and efficient action can help unleash your potential. Commit to taking action when ideas and nudges appear. 
- Believe there is more to you than you have shown so far. Allow your brilliance to come through for your highest good.

Saying "I can do it!" in this context could evoke feelings of fear, doubt, and inadequacy in the audience. Their reaction may be skepticism or judgment about whether you can achieve the goal. However, tapping to release negative emotions and limiting beliefs, then revisiting the visualization, can shift this. With an elevated sense of self-worth and confidence in your abilities, the audience's reaction may become more supportive.

The time aspect highlights unconscious expectations about how much work is required to earn more. Including desired work hours in the visualization helps identify limiting beliefs to clear around deserving higher pay for less work. Releasing these beliefs prevents self-sabotage by avoiding overwork.

 Here's a summary:

The author argues that some people hold themselves to an unrealistic standard of perfection which prevents them from achieving what they want in their careers or businesses. This mindset leads to constant self-criticism and feelings of inadequacy, which undermine self-confidence and motivation. The author shares the story of a client, Julie, who struggled. Julie was a passionate publicist but struggled financially because she needed to believe she was good enough to take on more prominent clients or market herself effectively. She constantly doubted herself and passed up opportunities out of fear of not being perfect. 

After identifying this pattern of perfectionism and self-doubt in Julie, the author was able to help her recognize how it was holding her back. Julie realized her harsh self-judgment and fear of inadequacy had created "invisible bars," keeping her locked into limited beliefs about her abilities. Clearing this block allowed Julie to move forward in her business more confidently and financially.

The key takeaway is that a rigid belief in the need to be perfect can be hugely limiting. It leads to constant self-criticism for any perceived imperfection and a lack of self-belief, which prevents risk-taking and progress. Recognizing and releasing this mindset can be very freeing and help open up more opportunities for success and reward.

 Here is a summary:

Julie was a successful publicist but struggled to increase her income and business due to a childhood belief that she always needed to strive for perfection. This caused her to feel she was never quite good enough and prevented her from taking risks. 

Tapping helped Julie clarify why she never felt she achieved her goals despite working hard. This allowed her to change her thoughts and take action to grow her business. Her income doubled, and her company expanded. She now sets bigger goals and has a vision without limits.

The need for perfection often comes from a childhood vow to be critical of oneself. This is illustrated in Julie's story. The vow creates an inner critic that constantly points out imperfections and ways to improve. Recognizing this vow and the downsides of needing to be perfect allows one to release it.

An exercise has one recall a time they did something well but still criticized themselves for not being perfect. Rating the truth of critical self-talk on a 1-10 scale helps identify this vow. Tapping on the feelings and thoughts around the vow helps release it, though it can take repeated rounds due to being an entrenched pattern of thinking that feels justified. 

Releasing the perfection vow allows one to strive for excellence and mastery from a place of self-worth rather than a need to prove one's worth. It enables celebrating achievements and allowing rewards and abundance into one's life now rather than when some unrealistic standard of perfection is met. The vitality and creativity unlocked by freeing oneself of the perfection vow lead to greater joy, focus, and success.

 Here is a summary:

- Many people unconsciously vow to be "invisible" to feel safe or gain approval. 
- This vow causes you to downplay your talents and value to please others. It makes you feel uncomfortable with increased visibility or confidence.
- The vow to be invisible hinders your ability to achieve big goals, ask for promotions or higher pay, market yourself, etc. It makes you feel like you have to suppress your true self.
- You can test if you have this vow by visualizing announcing your talents and value to influential people. Feeling very uncomfortable with this is a sign the vow is present. 
- The story of Michael illustrates how the vow to be invisible can shape someone's life and career in limiting ways by making them solely focus on meeting others' expectations. 
- Recognizing and releasing this vow is essential for gaining confidence, advancing your career or business, and achieving life goals.

 Here is a summary:

Michael felt stuck in a boring, unfulfilling life. He worked to support his family out of a sense of obligation, not passion. He suppressed his desires and talents to fulfill what he thought was expected of him as a husband and father. His life lacked freedom, joy, or stimulation. 

Michael lived within a rigid set of self-imposed rules and expectations he called his "box." He did not allow himself to pursue more engaging work or activities that interested him. Michael struggled to answer when asked if he was happy because he had lost touch with enjoying life. He wanted to earn more money in work that challenged and fulfilled him. 

Though intelligent and skilled, Michael's talents went unnoticed at his job because he deliberately tried not to stand out. He followed the belief that he should be modest and support others rather than promote himself. He felt trapped by this vow to remain "invisible."

Recognizing this vow was holding him back, Michael used Tapping to release its grip, and tapping on negative feelings around standing out and shining reduced his anxiety and desire to hide. Positive Tapping helped shift his mindset to valuing his gifts, wanting to share them, and deserving rewards and recognition. 

Releasing the vow to be invisible allowed Michael's true self to emerge. He realized he could inspire others by being his authentic self. Shining his light permitted others to do the same. Honoring his value attracted more opportunities, money, praise, and support. Using Tapping before promoting himself or asking for a raise helped Michael overcome inertia and confidently share his message. Loosening this vow transformed Michael's world by allowing abundance and fulfillment into his life.

 Here's a summary:

- Many people vow never to depend on anyone or ask for help to protect themselves. While this may seem practical, you need more support to receive support and achieve your goals. 
- To achieve enormous goals like building wealth, you need to be able to receive in addition to working hard. Receiving includes accepting money, recognition, and help from others. This won't be easy if you have a vow against needing or depending on others.
- This vow often originates in childhood, when your parents or caregivers did not meet your emotional needs. As a result, you learned to suppress your needs and desires to avoid disappointment and pain. You decided it was better to take care of yourself. 
- The vow to never be vulnerable or express your needs may seem like self-protection but ultimately keeps you from receiving what you want, like financial success or a loving relationship. You remain closed off and guarded.
- To determine if you have this vow, reflect on your childhood and how your needs were met. Did you feel comfortable expressing your needs and desires to your parents? Or did you learn it was better not to ask? Recalling these memories can help you release the vow.  
- Releasing this vow involves honoring your needs, doing small acts of self-care, permitting yourself to receive, and attracting more support and abundance. Letting go of judgment about needing help from others is also crucial. 
- Both men and women can take on this vow for different reasons. For men, it may be the belief that self-sufficiency is strength. For women, it could be the message to always please others before yourself. Either way, the vow ultimately limits your ability to receive.

 Here is a summary:

- The word "depression" is often used to describe suppressing or repressing your deepest feelings and desires, like anger, sadness, passion, enthusiasm, etc. 
- Many people learn to repress certain natural feelings and desires that are seen as selfish, unacceptable, or embarrassing. Releasing these repressed feelings can improve your financial and personal well-being.

- Asking for what you want is critical to manifesting it, but many hesitate or refuse to ask for their true desires. Not allowing yourself to have needs tells the universe you don't need anything, including rewards for your efforts. To receive, you must be open to it by being willing to ask.

- Many made a vow as a child to never depend on anyone or ask for their needs and wants to avoid pain, criticism, or disappointment. This vow caused them to shut down their deepest needs and desires. Releasing this vow through Tapping can help open you up to receiving wealth and abundance.  

- Positive Tapping can help change the course set by that childhood vow and allow you to start taking baby steps toward asking for and receiving what you want, including financial rewards and pleasure. It takes time and practice, but releasing the old vow opens you to greater abundance.

- Common phrases that keep you from receiving include: "I'll take care of it myself." "I can do it all myself." "That's okay; I'm strong." "I don't need much." Recognize these phrases and work to release them. You can be both self-reliant and supported. Practice asking for and receiving in small ways.

- Looking within at your inner child's deepest needs and desires can change what you ask for and how you ask for it. Though you may want to be rich, your subconscious mind may refuse it for many reasons. Releasing these can open you up to more incredible wealth and abundance.

 Here is a summary:

- Your subconscious mind heavily influences your ability to become wealthy. It protects you by avoiding perceived dangers, even if those dangers are not logical or realistic. 

- Early programming from family, religion, media, etc., often gives negative messages about wealthy people and money that become embedded in your subconscious. These include beliefs like:

- The rich are greedy, corrupt, arrogant, etc. 
- Money corrupts good people. 
- You can't be spiritual and wealthy. 
- Rich people hurt others to get what they want.

- Your subconscious connects becoming wealthy and emotional pain, loss, conflict, etc., based on your experiences and programming. It believes you're safer poor.

- Two exercises called the "money shadow" can reveal your negative beliefs about wealth:

1. Imagine telling your childhood parents about becoming wealthy and successful. Note their disapproving reaction and how uncomfortable you feel. This shows your programmed resistance to wealth.

2. Repeat with friends and colleagues. The discomfort shows you believe you wouldn't fit in anymore if you were wealthy. 

- The money shadow exercises reveal judgment of wealthy people, feelings of being an outcast, and discomfort with wealth and lifestyle changes. The goal is to clear these negative associations and programming.

- An example is Dr. Ellen, a chiropractor who loved her work but struggled financially. Her father had instilled a belief that "wealth corrupts." He reacted very negatively when she told him of her goal to become a multimillionaire. This contributed to her money shadow and financial struggles.

 Here is a summary:

Dr. Ellen's father told her repeatedly not to accept an inheritance from her wealthy uncle because he believed it would corrupt her. Dr. Ellen realized her negative views about wealth came from her financially struggling family, who thought there wasn't enough for everyone. She settled for "just getting by." 

After working with a coach, Dr. Ellen changed how she ran her business. She set higher goals, improved money management, and profits grew by 50% as she built a holistic healing center.

Tapping exercises helped reduce negative emotions and limiting beliefs from her past. The first exercise addressed discomfort around becoming wealthy and facing judgment or rejection from family. The second exercise had her voice judgments about a rich person representing her "money shadow." This revealed her resistance to and discomfort with wealth.

The coach said judging the wealthy person offered a "gift" by showing qualities Dr. Ellen lacked to build wealth, like valuing oneself, asking for what one wants, and not being underpaid. While the wealthy person's actions may be unfair or corrupt, looking beyond judgments could reveal benefits from perceived negative qualities, like arrogance reflecting a sense of power or self-worth. Adopting some of these qualities in a balanced way could help build wealth.

In summary, Dr. Ellen gained insights into how her upbringing and views about money limited her. Doing inner work to release these blocks and adopt a healthier mindset about wealth and her worth helped transform her business and financial situation.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

1. Commit to regularly observing and catching yourself falling into old limiting patterns. Become aware of habits related to how you think about and respond to money. Challenge these patterns when you notice them. Use the exercises and tapping to release the associated emotions and beliefs. 

2. Commit to showing up more fully engaged and energetic every day. Notice when you're not fully present or passionate, and re-energize yourself. Generate more energy, passion, and desire from within. Enthusiasm and excitement will attract more money and opportunities.

3. Commit to taking action and doing what's necessary to achieve your goals. Give yourself time to dream and brainstorm, then figure out the first steps and make a plan. Put action items on your calendar and set deadlines. Get an accountability partner to review goals and timelines, encourage progress and provide support. Accountability will increase your efficiency and effectiveness.

4. Change how you speak about and relate to money. Speak in the present tense about the amount of money you want, as if you already have it. Feel the emotions you would feel if you had that amount now. This helps collapse time and manifests your desires more quickly. 

5. Practice visualization and imagination. Spend time each day visualizing what you want as if you have it now. Use all your senses to make it feel real. Feel the emotions you would feel if living that reality now. This sends a powerful message to your subconscious and the universe. With practice, your visualizations become more powerful and precise.

In summary, commit to awareness, action, accountability, reframing your speech and thoughts about money, and using visualization. These five daily disciplines will help you create a new vibration about money and manifest new levels of wealth and abundance. With practice and persistence, you can reprogram yourself and become the wealthy person you desire.

 Here is a summary:

Permit yourself to choose not to accomplish your goals. Knowing you can walk away makes choosing your plan feel more comfortable. When you consciously choose your destination, you must accept the difficulties that come with it and stop complaining. 

You will have moments of fear, anger, and self-doubt. Accept that these feelings are part of being human. Own that you are imperfectly human and imperfectly successful. Use tapping to release limiting emotions.

Commit to your goal and take action. Ask the universe for support and guidance. Be open to resources and ideas that help you further your vision. Notice when limiting or sabotaging yourself and shift your mindset to possibility and courage. Your goal is possible for you because you are a creator.

Have faith in the process. Although Tapping may seem strange or simplistic, give it a chance. It has helped the author overcome similar doubts and limitations around money. With practice, Tapping can help you achieve wealth and financial freedom.

 Here's a summary:

Your career path may have looked very different had you not been open-minded enough to try Emotional Freedom Techniques or Tapping. This technique sounded strange initially but ended up helping you in many areas of your life, especially around wealth and abundance. You sincerely hope that readers have been able to use Tapping to improve their financial situation and mindset.
