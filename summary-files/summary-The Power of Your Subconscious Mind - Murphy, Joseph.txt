The key ideas are that you have immense untapped power within you, and you can consciously utilize your subconscious mind to shape your life in extraordinary ways, through choosing and focusing your thoughts.

 

1. Your mind has two levels: conscious (rational) and subconscious (irrational). 
2. Your conscious mind is the reasoning mind. It chooses and makes decisions. Your subconscious mind is the seat of emotion and creativity. It creates according to the thoughts you habitually think.
3. Once your subconscious mind accepts an idea, it works to execute it. It works by associating ideas and using all your knowledge and experiences to achieve its goal. 
4. Your subconscious mind does not reason or argue. It accepts what you consciously believe as truth and acts on it. It will get false ideas as readily as good ones.
5. Experiments show that people in a hypnotic state will act out any suggestion given to them by the hypnotist, demonstrating the power of the subconscious mind to accept ideas without discernment. 
6. Your conscious mind is also called the objective mind because it deals with the outside world through your five senses. Your subconscious mind is also called the subjective mind. It perceives in a way that is separate from your feelings through intuition and non-physical means. 
7. Your subconscious mind cannot reason but relies on the habitual thoughts you've had, even if they are wrong or harmful. To overcome negative patterns, conscious repetition of constructive new ideas will change subconscious patterns.
8. Your conscious mind is like a "watchman at the gate" to protect your subconscious mind from negative impressions and false ideas. But once an idea gets into the subconscious mind, it works to bring that idea into your experience. 
9. Suggestion is compelling in influencing the subconscious mind. Whether the suggestions come from yourself or others, your subconscious will work to make them your reality. Control the tips you allow into your mind.

The primary keys are that we must guard our minds carefully, be discerning about the ideas we allow, and consciously work to retrain our subconscious thought patterns by repeating positive, constructive thoughts. Our experiences follow the workings of the mind, so we shape our lives by using the power of thinking. Understanding the relationship between the conscious and subconscious mind gives us the tools to transform our lives for the better.

 Here is a summary of the fundamental laws of mind based on the excerpt:

1. Your subconscious mind is amenable to suggestions. It does not reason or thinks critically. It simply accepts what your conscious mind tells it.

2. Your subconscious mind reacts to the impressions given to it by your conscious mind. It does not prefer one suggestion over another. It will accept whatever tips you provide to it.

3. Different people will react differently to the same suggestion based on their beliefs and conditioning. Your reaction to a request depends on your internal assumptions and beliefs. 

4. A suggestion cannot impose something on your subconscious mind against the will of your conscious mind. You have the power to reject requests. Your aware mind rules over your subconscious mind.

5. The power of a suggestion depends on whether you accept it mentally. If you get a request, your subconscious mind will bring it into reality. If you reject an offer, it will have no power.

6. Autosuggestion means giving suggestions to yourself. It can be used to overcome fears, improve your memory, develop a better temperament, and more. Repeating positive autosuggestions can recondition your mind.

7. Heterosuggestion refers to suggestions from other people. It can be either constructive or destructive. It is essential to reject negative heterosuggestions to avoid their damaging effects. It would help if you actively counteracted negative suggestions with positive autosuggestions.

8. We have all received many negative heterosuggestions since childhood that can negatively impact our behavior and habits. Autosuggestion is a way to release yourself from negative verbal conditioning and recondition your mind.

9. You can reject negative suggestions from the media and other external sources by providing positive autosuggestions to your subconscious mind. Protect your mind from fear and anxiety by choosing constructive thoughts.

The excerpt covers the primary laws and ideas of suggestion, autosuggestion, and heterosuggestion. Please let me know if you want me to clarify or expand on any summary part.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

1. Heterosuggestion: The suggestions and statements of others have no power over you unless you accept them mentally. Your subconscious mind responds to what you think. 
2. Your subconscious mind is impersonal and non-judgmental. It does not argue with you or tell you that you "must not" impress it with negative thoughts. It is up to you to guard your mind and feed it the right ideas and imagery. 
3. Your mind works like a syllogism: a central premise leading to a conclusion. What you assume and believe to be true in your conscious mind is accepted by your subconscious mind, which then responds accordingly. Choose your assumptions and beliefs wisely.
4. Your subconscious mind solves problems and reveals answers when you positively affirm that it knows the answers and responds to you. Relax your mind and maintain an attitude of trust and expectancy. 
5. You have free will and the power of choice. You can choose positive or negative thoughts. Choose wisely, as your choices shape your destiny. 
6. Think good, and good follows. Think evil, and evil follows. You attract what you think about. 
7. Watch your speech. Your subconscious mind does not distinguish between jokes and reality. Speak only of what you want to manifest. 
8. Never say "I can't." Say instead, "I can do all things through the power of my subconscious mind."
9. Your mind is not evil. How you use its powers depends on you. Use your mind to bless, heal and inspire. 
10. You control your own thoughts and destiny. Do not give that power away to others or to circumstances. Choose your own thoughts and make your own decisions. 
11. Assume the best and expect the best. Your subconscious mind will make it manifest. Believe in good fortune, right action, and all the blessings of life.

- In the 19th century, Dr. James Esdaille performed over 400 surgeries in India using only hypnosis as anesthesia. He suggested to patients that no infections would develop, and few did. This shows the power of the subconscious mind.
- Whatever thoughts or beliefs you impress on your subconscious mind, you will experience them as events and circumstances. Your thoughts become your reality. 
- The subconscious cannot argue or question. It expresses what the conscious mind impresses on it. That is why you must feed it with positive and constructive thoughts.
- The key to health and happiness is harmony between the conscious and subconscious minds. Discord and frustration come from unfulfilled desires.

- The author cites an example of healing a skin malignancy through reprogramming his subconscious mind to know that it created his body and can heal it. He prayed, impressed his subconscious with health, and was healed.

In summary, your subconscious mind is mighty and can heal, guide, and inspire you. You tap into this power through your thoughts and beliefs. You can transform your life uniquely by keeping your conscious and subconscious minds in harmony and feeding the latter positive impressions.

• The subconscious can restore even "dead" parts of the body. Madame Bire's optic nerves were healed at Lourdes even though doctors said they were useless. Her belief in being healed activated her subconscious power. 

• To convey the idea of perfect health to your subconscious and relax your body and mind. Then affirm that God's perfection is expressed through you, and the picture of excellent health fills your subconscious. Repeat imagery of yourself in perfect health.

 Here's a summary:

- Throughout history, people have believed in the existence of a higher healing power that could be invoked through certain rituals and ceremonies. 
- Early healing practices involved supplications to God, laying of hands, incantations, amulets, etc. The priests and holy men were thought to have healing powers given by God.
- Unofficial healers have often achieved results where mainstream medicine failed. Their methods were based on the belief and imagination of the patient, which accessed the healing power of the subconscious mind.
- The Bible recommends believing you have already received what you desire to achieve it. This taps into the creative power of thought and the subconscious mind. Faith and belief are critical. 
- Examples from the Bible include Jesus healing the blind men according to their faith and commanding unclean spirits with authority and power.

In summary, the key ideas are:

1) There is a universal healing power that people throughout history have accessed through belief and imagination. 
2) This healing power resides in the subconscious mind. 
3) Rituals, ceremonies, and other methods are meant to harness the mind's belief and tap into this healing power.
4) Faith and belief are the mechanisms through which healing is achieved. According to the Bible, believing you already have what you desire leads to actualizing it.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

1. The healing power is in your own subconscious mind. 
2. Faith activates the healing power of the subconscious mind. Have faith and expectancy that you will get well.
3. What you conceive in your mind, you can achieve. Believe in the reality of your idea, and it will manifest. 
4. Your health, beauty, and perfection knowledge can heal others by changing their subconscious patterns.
5. Miraculous healings are due to imagination and blind faith activating the subconscious mind's healing power.
6. All disease originates in the mind. The body manifests what the mind believes. 
7. The body reveals what the mind feels and believes. Change your mind, and you can change your body.
8. Remove the mental blocks to healing by affirming health, harmony, and wholeness. They Poured into the subconscious mind.
9. The life principle will flow through any body organ or part with an open mental and emotional receptivity channel.   
10. Your own subconscious mind hypnotizes you based on your beliefs, impressions, and suggestions. Change these, and you change your mind and body.

The key idea is that your subconscious mind has enormous healing and creative power, which is activated by your conscious beliefs, imaginations, impressions, faith, and expectancy. It would help if you changed your mind to change your body and life experiences. Your body reflects what your mind believes and feels at the subconscious level. By pouring in positive thoughts, impressions, and suggestions, you activate the healing potential and open the flow of the life power in your body and mind.

 

1. Symptoms of any disease can be induced in a person through hypnotic suggestion. This shows the power of a person's thoughts and beliefs. 

2. There is only one healing process - faith. There is only one healing power - your subconscious mind.

3. Whether the object of your faith is real or imagined, you will experience results. Your subconscious mind responds to your thoughts and beliefs. View faith as a thought in your mind.

4. No one directly heals another person. Doctors, psychologists, and others help remove mental and physical blocks so a person's innate healing ability can function. The one healing power goes by many names - Nature, Life, God, Creative Intelligence, and the subconscious mind.

5. The healing power within each person can heal the mind and body of all diseases when adequately directed. This power operates in all people regardless of beliefs or backgrounds. 

6. The modern mental healing approach is based on the idea that the subconscious mind responds to a person's beliefs and faith. Practitioners relax, let go of distractions and direct the subconscious mind through visualization and belief.

7. There is only one universal healing principle in everything - animals, plants, minerals, etc. In humans, it operates through faith. According to your faith, so shall it be.

8. Beliefs are thoughts in your mind that direct the power of your subconscious. The Bible refers to belief itself, not belief in any particular ritual, person, or formula. Your experiences reflect your beliefs. 

9. Prayer therapy combines the conscious and subconscious mind, directed at a specific purpose. You consciously choose an idea, feel its reality and convey it to the subconscious, trusting in the healing. With practice, the conscious and subconscious unite to release healing power.

10. "Faith healing" refers to healing without understanding the underlying mechanisms. It relies on blind belief in a particular healer, method, or theory. Any technique that moves someone from fear to faith and expectation can heal. But there are many theories and practices, none of which is definitively correct. 

11. Examples of blind faith healing include Franz Mesmer's "animal magnetism" healing, which we now attribute to the placebo effect and imagination. While Mesmer achieved results, there needed to be evidence for his theory of magnetic fluids. Subjective, or subconscious, faith refers to controlling your subconscious mind through your conscious thoughts and beliefs. Ceasing opposition to an idea, religion, or theory can allow subjective faith to exert its effects.

 

The body's healing requires the cooperation of the conscious and subconscious mind. However, the subconscious mind can be receptive to healing suggestions when the conscious mind is relaxed and passive. 

A person received healing through a minister even though he did not consciously believe the minister's suggestions. This is because, in a relaxed, passive state, his subconscious mind accepted the requests, and the two subjective reasons were able to connect.

Absent healing works because there is a universal mind that connects us all. When you pray for someone far away, your mind projects health and images onto the universal subconscious, manifesting through the other person.

Releasing the power of the subconscious mind requires avoiding speaking of ailments and illnesses. Give the subconscious mind positive images before sleep, and its kinetic energy will continue working throughout rest.

 Practical techniques for mental healing and prayer include:
    1. Learning that your thoughts and beliefs create your reality
    2. Develop a plan to convey requests to your subconscious mind
    3. Imagining the end result you desire 
    4. Choosing positive and life-affirming beliefs 
    5. Focusing on noble thoughts which grow into noble acts
    6. Using the power of prayer and affirming what you want
    7. Having faith in the power of your mind to heal
    8. Praying for others through visualization of their health and wholeness

- She relaxed, entered a sleepy state, and repeated the phrase "It is finished in Divine Order" for ten nights. 
- On the 11th day, the dispute was resolved harmoniously.
- Entering a sleepy state reduces effort and makes the subconscious mind receptive. Repeating an affirmation in this state helps it to be accepted by the subconscious.
- The "Thank You" technique involves repeating "Thank you, [God/Father/Universe]" with gratitude, faith, and joy for the desired outcome. This lifts the mind to acceptance and helps overcome negative thoughts. 
- A man used this technique for three weeks to find a job and receive money. He was then hired by a former employer and given a loan. 
- The power of an affirmation comes from understanding the underlying truth. It does not change reality but helps rearrange incorrect subconscious patterns to align with reality. 
- The author used the affirmative method from a distance to help heal his sister. He affirmed statements of her perfection, wholeness, healing, and openness to healing. After two weeks, examinations showed she had recovered. 
- Affirming is stating something is so now, regardless of evidence. Repeat it until the subconscious accepts it.

- There are suggestions for using mental science and the subconscious mind for health, success, and prosperity. This includes picturing your desires, avoiding effort, being grateful, and affirming what you want.

- The subconscious mind is life-giving, controlling body functions, and a source of inspiration. It speaks through intuitions and urges that encourage progress and greatness. Examples are invalids performing feats of endurance in emergencies and artists getting ideas from their subconscious minds. The subconscious can bring solutions, like stories, serially.

In summary, the absolute and decree methods tap into a higher power that can be directed toward healing, prosperity, and progress. The subconscious mind is a source of inspiration, vitality, and solutions that people can learn to access for a better life. Faith and the right mental approach are crucial to achieving results with these methods.

- Healing requires allowing the vital forces of the subconscious mind to flow freely through the body. This can be achieved by replacing negative thoughts with positive affirmations.

13. The best times to communicate with your subconscious are just before sleep when your mind is relaxed.

 

- Imagining the feeling of your desire being fulfilled leads to its realization. Your subconscious mind brings about what you imagine and feel to be true.

- Controlled imagination and feeling are essential. A woman imagined conversations with her lawyer about a harmonious settlement to her lawsuit. This led to an actual payment in her favor. 

- Let your thoughts and feelings be constructive and uplifting. Your subconscious mind will respond accordingly.

- Relax your mind and do not exert too much effort. Accept an idea, and your subconscious will execute it.

- Do not worry about bodily functions. Have faith in your subconscious mind.

- Your imagination is powerful. Imagine what is good, and it will come to be. You become what you imagine.

- In a sleepy, drowsy state, imagine your desire fulfilled repeatedly. This avoids conflict between your conscious and subconscious mind.

- To build wealth consciousness, repeat "Wealth" and "Success" to yourself a few times daily. Dwell on the idea of wealth and its inner power. This leads to the manifestation of wealth.

- Merely saying "I am wealthy" or "I am prosperous" often fails because you feel it is untrue. This conflicts with your subconscious impression.

- A better approach is saying, "By day and night, I am being prospered in all my interests." This does not arouse inner conflict.

- Avoid negative or fearful statements like "There is not enough" or "I will lose the house." These are like signing a blank check for adverse conditions.

- Deposit thoughts of prosperity, success, and wealth into your subconscious daily. Your subconscious multiplies what you deposit in it.

- Neutralize any fearful thoughts with constructive ones before they take root. Replace "I will not be able to make that payment" with "By day and by night, I am prospered in all my ways."

- Your wealth depends not on outside conditions but on the ideas within your subconscious mind. An infinite supply of ideas flows from your subconscious.

 

- Wealth is a state of mind. If you convince your subconscious mind that you are wealthy, you will attract wealth. The forms that wealth takes are irrelevant. 

- Many people struggle financially because they criticize and resent successful and wealthy people. This negativity prevents them from attracting prosperity. The way to overcome this is to wish for more incredible wealth and success for those who prosper. This positivity will attract wealth to you.

- Envy blocks the flow of wealth. Rejoice in the success of others instead of being envious. This will allow wealth to flow to you. 

- Repeating the word "wealth" as you fall asleep plants the seed of prosperity in your subconscious mind and will attract wealth to you.

- You attract wealth by building the idea of wealth and prosperity into your mentality. Your subconscious mind will give you the means to attain wealth.  

- It is your right to be wealthy and live an abundant life. Money is a symbol of prosperity and economic health. Hoarding money indicates financial fear and illness.

- Knowledge of your subconscious mind will lead you to wealth in all areas of life. Regardless of outside conditions, you will be prosperous if you impress the idea of wealth on your subconscious. 

- Many people lack wealth because they criticize money or feel poverty is virtuous. This is a false belief that prevents prosperity. There is no virtue in poverty. It is a mental disease, just like a physical disease.

- The desire to be wealthy is the desire to lead a full, happy, and prosperous life. It is not only pleasing but perfect. Wealth provides freedom, beauty, luxury, and abundance.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- Do not criticize money or regard it as evil. If you do, it will flee from you. 
- Develop a positive attitude toward money by affirming that you like it, use it wisely, and are grateful for the abundance in your life.
- Money is neutral and a means of exchange. It is not inherently good or bad.
- To attract money, picture yourself already in possession of it and feel the reality of it. Persist in this visualization, and it will manifest.
- Do not resent the wealth of others. Rejoice in their prosperity, and you will attract more wealth for yourself. 
- Negative thoughts about money can prevent you from earning or attracting more. Monitor your thoughts and correct them if needed.
- Thinking you need to get something for nothing reflects a scarcity mindset. Develop faith in the source of supply and know you will be provided for.
- Claim your right to be prosperous. Your subconscious will honor this and work to make it so.
- Know that money is constantly circulating in your life like the tide. Even when it is out, have faith that it will return.

- Poverty is a disease of the mind. Heal your thoughts about money and abundance. You deserve to prosper.
- Repeat that you like money and use it wisely. Release any negative associations. 
- Money itself is neutral. Evil arises from ignorance and misuse of the mind.

 

1. Your subconscious mind responds to the mental pictures and images you hold in your mind. It works to fulfill those images and bring them into reality.

- Specialize in one area and become an expert. Know more about it than anyone else. Develop a passion for your work. 

- Be sure your work benefits others. Don't be selfish. Help humanity. What goes around comes around. 

5. True success is not just about making money. It includes peace of mind, good health, and a clear conscience. Fraudulent gains usually don't last and often backfire.

6. Successful people love their work and fully express themselves. They understand the power of their subconscious mind to achieve success. Visualizing the end result causes the subconscious mind to respond and fulfill that mental picture.

7. Examples show how a movie actors and pharmacists succeeded by holding onto their dreams and using the power of sustained imagination and the subconscious mind. They lived as though their goals were already realized.

8. You can achieve business success by visualizing your goals, using your imagination, and harnessing the power of your subconscious mind - like Goethe did.

 

- The lecturer described how a young stockbroker used 
imaginary conversations with a millionaire client to build his
confidence and make successful investments. Through
controlled imagination aligned with his aims, the broker became
a success.

- A 16-year-old boy improved his poor grades by affirming his
perfect memory and radiating goodwill to help fix this in his
subconscious mind. His new mental attitude led to his success.

- In buying and selling, relax your mind, visualize what you want,
and turn it over to your subconscious, trusting that your aim will 
be fulfilled as a seed grows into a plant. Examples show how a man 
sold his house this way and how affirming the right buyer makes 
a sale.

- A woman received a Cadillac by imagining choosing and driving 
it for two weeks. Then her uncle left her the car in his will. Her 
mental practice matched the physical result. 

- Repeating the word "success" with faith and conviction leads your
subconscious to compel you to succeed. Success means living well 
and happily, fulfilling your aims in work and relationships, and 
using your mind's powers. Tips summarize how to achieve success.

The key ideas are using your imagination and subconscious mind, focusing on your aims, and trusting in the results. Mental practice, 
affirmation, and visualization help shape reality. Success comes from 
living purposefully, using your talents, serving others, having peace of mind, 
and understanding higher powers. Following your guidance and sustaining 
imagination lets the miraculous unfold.

2. Repeat this process often. Through repetition, you occupy your subconscious mind with this goal. This will make you feel the joy and excitement of achieving the promotion.

3. Your subconscious mind stores all your memories. To improve your memory, affirm: "The infinite intelligence of my subconscious mind reveals to me everything I need to know at all times, everywhere."

4. To sell a property, affirm: "Infinite intelligence attracts to me the buyer for this house or property, who wants it, and who prospers in it." Repeat this with faith and conviction. 

5. The idea of success contains the elements of success. Repeat the word "success" frequently with faith, and you will feel compelled to succeed.

Many famous scientists and researchers have used their subconscious mind to gain insights and solutions, including:

- Nikola Tesla could build inventions in his imagination in precise detail. In 20 years, every device of his work as imagined.

- After weeks of failure, Professor Agassiz, a naturalist, solved the riddle of a fossil fish in his dream. He drew the fish in his plan, which matched the fossil.

- Dr. Frederick Banting discovered the idea of insulin in a dream after much concentration. His subconscious mind revealed the solution. 

- Lothar von Blenk-Schmidt, a scientist imprisoned in a Russian concentration camp, escaped by visualizing walking down Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles every night. His vision manifested in reality, and he went to LA, where the surroundings were familiar, though he had never been there before.  

- Archaeologists and paleontologists use their imagination and subconscious mind to reconstruct ancient scenes and gain insights into the past. Their subconscious has a memory of all that has transpired.

Many people blame God for suffering in the world and their personal difficulties. However, God is not responsible for people's misery and suffering. People's negative thoughts and beliefs about God lead to adverse reactions from their subconscious mind, causing them harm. Once people let go of their resentment and anger at God and accept that God loves and cares for them, they will experience more joy and blessings. 

Life always forgives our mistakes and works to restore us to health and harmony. Negative thoughts and feelings only hamper this. A man who constantly worked to punish himself realized he was creating his own suffering. Once he forgave himself and changed his perspective, his health improved.

A man who murdered his brother years ago was tortured by guilt, believing God would punish him. However, he was a changed man, and the 'old' man who committed the crime was gone. He realized he was condemning an innocent man and forgave himself.

Criticism cannot hurt you without your consent. A schoolteacher who received criticism used it as a learning experience instead of reacting with resentment. With understanding, she saw the criticism was meant to help her improve.

A woman left at the altar on her wedding day remained faithful to God's plan rather than reacting with anger or bitterness. She knew it was not meant to be and had prayed for the right action.

A young woman was raised to believe many normal activities were sinful and that she herself was evil. She felt guilty going against her upbringing. She came to realize she had been brainwashed, and with help, unlearned these false beliefs, freeing her to live a happy life. She learned forgiveness for herself.

In summary, people's suffering is often self-created through their negative beliefs and reactions. People can free themselves of unnecessary misery with a positive impression of a loving God, the forgiveness of themselves and others, and understanding. Life always works to restore people to health and harmony when they allow it.

- We are creatures of habit. The subconscious mind forms habits through repetition. Choose good habits, and you will be under their compulsion. Choose bad habits, and you will also be under their compulsion. The solution to bad habits is forming new, positive habits to replace them.

 

- The law of the subconscious mind is compulsion. The subconscious mind compulsively drives habits.
- Mr. Jones developed a habit of excessive drinking that he couldn't break through willpower alone. He felt powerless against the urge to drink.

- A medical student overcame his fear of failing exams by visualizing his mother congratulating him on doing well. He imagined receiving a letter from her congratulating him. Focusing his mind on this positive outcome helped overcome his fear of failure.
- Fear of water, closed spaces, heights, etc., can be overcome with the same visualization technique and focusing on positive outcomes. For example, repeatedly visualize swimming or climbing mountains with joy and confidence. This will overcome the fear by impressing the subconscious mind.
- You can "bless" objects of fear, like elevators, by visualizing using them with peace and joy. This helps overcome the fear of that object. 
- Normal fear is reasonable as it protects us, but abnormal fear involves letting your imagination run wild with worrying and negative fantasies. This can attract the very things you fear. The antidote is to move your mind to the opposite - focus on positive outcomes and desires.
- Examining your fears rationally can also help overcome them, as often there is no real "boogieman" behind the fear. Staring the fear in the eye and facing it helps overcome the fear.

In summary, various techniques like visualization of positive outcomes, affirmations, blessing objects of fear, and facing fears rationally can help overcome fear and negative thoughts. The key is focusing your mind on the constructive rather than the fearful.

 

A man had to parachute from a damaged plane during World War and land in the jungle. He was frightened but knew there were two kinds of fear: normal fear for safety and abnormal fear that is unnecessary and harmful. 

He decided to overcome his fear immediately. He spoke positively to himself, saying his fear was just a desire for safety and that Infinite Intelligence was guiding him. He kept affirming this for 10 minutes, building his confidence. Soon his mood changed, and he began walking. He eventually made it out of the jungle and was rescued. His mental attitude of faith and confidence saved him. If he had succumbed to abnormal fear, he likely would have died.

A general manager feared losing his job for three years, imagining failure, even though there was no real threat. His negative imagination and fear caused mistakes and poor decisions, and he was fired. His fear created the outcome he wanted to avoid.

A government official stayed calm when facing political difficulties and plots against him. He meditated each morning on inner peace. He knew no negative thought could manifest unless he accepted and emotionalized it. So he refused to entertain the fears and beliefs of others. 

Several suggestions for overcoming fear:

1. Do what you fear, and the fear will disappear. Say you will master the fear. 

2. Replace fear (a negative thought) with a positive review. Fear is behind failure and sickness; confidence and faith in good are more powerful.

3. Love casts out fear. Fall in love with good things like honesty and success. Expect the best. 

4. Replace fear suggestions with positive ones, like "I sing beautifully." Repeat them. 

5. Fear causes amnesia; affirm you have a perfect memory. Imagine a friend congratulating you on success.

6. If afraid of something like water or closed spaces, visualize happily experiencing it. Your mind will compel you to conquer the fear. 

7. We only have two inborn fears: of falling and of loud noises. All others are learned and can be unlearned.  

8. Normal fear protects us, but abnormal fear is unhealthy and creates panic and terror. It persists and is obsessed over.

9. Abnormal fears do not exist in reality, only in thoughts. Thoughts are creative. Replace fearful thoughts with good ones.  

10. Nothing outside you can disturb you, only your own thoughts. Others' threats or suggestions have no power. Focus thoughts on sound, and God's power is there. God is harmony.

11. Replace fear of failure with success; fear of sickness with health; fear of accidents with God's guidance; fear of death with eternal life. Expect good. Your subconscious always answers you.

12. You stay young in spirit by generating qualities like patience, goodwill, and peace, which never age. Only fear of age, not age itself, causes premature decline. Many have accomplished great things in old age through a youthful spirit and thought life.

13. One man grew old and ill quickly because of his attitude of uselessness and belief that age meant decline and death. His mind created what he expected. Age is not years but growing wisdom, and life is endless.

 

- Do not equate old age with the end of life. Old age can be the beginning of a fruitful and productive life. Expect to live a long, active life, and your subconscious mind will make it happen.

- Aging is change, not decline. It should be welcomed as a natural progression of life's phases. Humans have spiritual and intellectual powers that transcend the physical body.

- There is evidence for some aspect of human consciousness surviving physical death, suggesting that life is eternal. Though we can't see life directly, we know we are alive. Life is self-renewing and indestructible.

- The mind and spirit do not age. Qualities like peace, joy, wisdom, and understanding do not fade with age. A person's character, intellect, faith, and convictions do not necessarily decay over time.

- You are as old as you think you are. Those who believe old age means decline will experience frustration and stagnation. But those who maintain a youthful spirit and believe they still have much to offer will remain active and vital.

- Do not hide your age or try desperately to appear young. Your age signifies wisdom, experience, and maturity, which are valuable assets. Employers who discount older workers are misguided.

- Do not fear old age. What you fear will come upon you. If you maintain an open and active mind, continually learning and embracing new ideas, you will remain young at heart.

- Even in old age, you have much to offer others through your knowledge, experience, and wisdom. You can continue to grow mentally and help guide younger people. 

- Remain receptive to new ideas and pursuits to avoid a mental and physical decline in retirement. Retirement can allow one to start new ventures and embark on long-held dreams. It does not mean life is over.

- The example of the 110-year-old man shows that age does not necessarily bring mental and physical deterioration. With an open mind and heart, a person can remain vital even into old age.

In summary, the message is that age is primarily a state of mind. While physical changes are inevitable, a person's spirit and vitality do not depend on the physical body. By maintaining a youthful and open mindset, and embracing new growth and life's changes, a person can lead a meaningful, purposeful, and impactful life for many years.

 
- The passage discusses maintaining an active and youthful mindset even as one age physically. 
- The author argues that chronological age alone does not determine one's mental and physical capacity. With an active, growth-oriented mindset, one can remain productive and dynamic well into old age.
- The author cites many examples of influential historical figures who accomplished great things later in life, sometimes starting new pursuits and achieving their greatest successes in their 70s, 80s, and even 90s. Their vitality came from an active, engaged mindset focused on continual learning and growth. 
- The passage recommends cultivating positive qualities that do not deteriorate with age, such as patience, kindness, love, joy, wisdom, and understanding. With these qualities, one can "remain young in mind and body."
- Fear and negative beliefs about aging can themselves contribute to premature deterioration of mind and body. But maintaining a positive, growth mindset can slow or prevent this deterioration. 
- "You are as young as you think you are." Your age is determined by your mindset, not just the passing years. With an active, expansive mood, the "fruits of old age" can include greater wisdom, joy, and productivity. 
- The passage provides many "profitable pointers" for nurturing a youthful mindset and spirit, even as the body ages. These include embracing new pursuits, continual learning, meditation, developing positive qualities, and overcoming fears and negative stereotypes related to aging.

In summary, the central message is that age itself does not define a person's potential or capacity for growth. With the right mindset, one can achieve great things at any age. An active, optimistic, and expansion-oriented attitude is the key to vitality, and this is within anyone's power to develop, regardless of age or circumstance.
