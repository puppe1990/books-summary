Here is a summary of how to attract money:

• Develop a positive mindset about money. Do not condemn it or see it as evil. Money is a symbol of abundance and a means to a better life.

• Know that you have a right to prosperity and abundance. Do not feel guilty about wanting money.

• Get rid of any negative beliefs that link money to evil or greed. Money itself is not the root of sin; the love of money to the exclusion of all else can lead to problems. But money itself is good.

• See money as a means to freedom, luxury, and fuller life. Appreciate the good in money.

• Do not feel that poverty is more virtuous. Poverty is a disease that should be eradicated. You deserve abundance.

• Take action to improve your financial situation. Do not remain in lack and scarcity. Work to develop skills, look for opportunities, and make more money.

• Maintain balance in life. Do not become obsessed only with making money. Focus on relationships, experiences, health, and personal growth as well. Money is a means to a good life but not the only thing that matters.

• Know that you can attract money through the power of your mind. Develop confidence in your ability to be prosperous.

• Use money constructively to help others. Share your abundance and make a positive difference.

• See obstacles as self-created and work to overcome them. Do not feel like a victim of circumstances. You have the power within you to succeed.

That covers some fundamental principles for developing a prosperous mindset and attracting more money. The essential ideas are recognizing your right to abundance, creating a positive view of money, taking action, maintaining balance, and using the power of your mind. Apply these principles, believe in yourself, and work to achieve your financial goals.

Here are the key ideas and a summary of the passage:

- Economic health depends on the free flow of money. When people hoard money out of fear, it leads to economic troubles. The crash of 1929 was caused by widespread public anxiety and panic.

- You live in both a subjective mental world and the objective physical world. It would help if you nourished both your physical and psychological well-being. Knowing how to use your mental and spiritual power can lead to an abundance of all kinds.

- Someone who understands the spiritual laws of the mind knows they will always be provided for, no matter what happens in the economy or world. They maintain a consciousness of wealth. Wealth is a state of mind.

- Money circulates like the tides - it goes out but always comes back in. Trust in the eternal, endless supply of the Divine. Someone with this mindset is okay with market ups and downs or currency issues.

- To build wealth consciousness: Relax your mind. Reflect on where ideas, wealth, your mind, and life come from - the One Source. Repeat: "Money is forever circulating freely in my life, and there is always a Divine surplus." Feel the truth of this.

- For those in financial difficulty, affirmations like "I am wealthy" may backfire by highlighting the contradiction with their current situation. Better to start with "I am prospering more each day." or "My wealth is growing each day." This avoids conflict and is believable.

- Advanced students can use "I am prosperous" and "I am wealthy" by identifying those qualities with God, the infinite supply and Source of all. What is true of God is true of them.

- Repeating and focusing on "health, wealth, and success" helps generate results by aligning with the eternal truths. You don't say "I am..." which could create opposition in the mind.

- A story is shared of a young man who visualized becoming a doctor, despite having no money or education. He persisted in his mental imagery and vision, and eventually, a doctor took him under his wing, paid for his education, and became a doctor. His wealth was in his mind and vision.

- Wealth comes from your purpose, desire to serve, and capacity to contribute value to others. How your vision is achieved is usually hidden and emerges step by step. You have to hold the image, and you will be compelled into action. The law of the subconscious and of life is action and reaction.

- The author imagined his book being published in French for several weeks. Soon, he was contacted by a publisher about a French edition. The way opened up for the vision to become real.

The critical points in the summary are:

1. Our external actions follow our inner thoughts and feelings. We must change our mental attitude and way of looking at the world to receive what we desire.

2. We must reject negative thoughts from others and believe in our ability to succeed. Doubt and fear will prevent us from achieving our goals.

3. We must not resent or be envious of the success and wealth of others. Doing so will only hurt us. We should rejoice in the prosperity of others. What we bless, we multiply. What we condemn, we lose.

4. We will lose our job or income if we think negatively about our work or financial situation. Our negative thoughts manifest in the physical world.

5. Those who accumulate wealth through unethical means often suffer mentally and physically. We can be prosperous without harming others.

6. Whenever we resent or are jealous of others, we steal from ourselves - our peace, health, happiness, etc. We must cast out these negative thoughts.

7. Fear and consciousness of lack can attract loss and theft. We must avoid hoarding supplies out of fear and trust God to provide for our needs.

8. Before outer thieves rob us, we have already stolen ourselves through our negative inner thoughts. We must eliminate the "inner thief" - guilt, fear, accusation, etc.

9. What we constantly accuse ourselves of on the inside, we will be charged with on the outside. We must pray for truth and harmony to prevail.

In summary, our negative and fearful thoughts cause loss, lack, and misfortune. We must transform our thinking by cultivating faith, blessing others, and accepting our good. This is the path to prosperity and abundance.

The great law is to think of others the way you want them to think of you and feel about others the way you want them to feel about you. Say from your heart, "I wish for every person peace, love, joy, abundance, and God's blessings." Rejoice in the good fortune and success of others—claim for others what you claim for yourself. Do not resent others or their success. Hatred and resentment only hurt you.

Store up spiritual and mental treasures that cannot be taken from you. Fill your mind with positivity. Claim peace and wisdom for your finances and protection for your possessions. You are not a victim of circumstances but can overcome them. Even people with low incomes in spirit can find growth. Dissatisfaction leads to seeking satisfaction. Problems lead us to find solutions within. Though desires are met, new desires arise in a cycle of eternal change. Feed your inner needs and imagine possessing what you desire. Seek to remedy lack and discomfort. The desire for prosperity comes from God.

Pain and problems are blessings in disguise; signaling needs to be met. Meet fear and worry with eternal truths. A cheerful heart brings joy and health. Remember the gifts of God within.

• Riches and prosperity are attained through mental and spiritual means, not material ones. Your mindset and consciousness determine your level of wealth and abundance.

• Focus on contributing value to others through your talents and skills. This desire to serve will attract prosperity.

• Do not be attached to material symbols of wealth like money, as these can be lost. True wealth is your knowledge, skills, and ability to help others.

• You can change your circumstances by changing your mindset and thoughts. Replace thoughts of lack and poverty with thoughts of abundance and prosperity. Your outer world reflects your inner world.

• The story of Jesus turning water into wine is a metaphor for transforming your mindset and thoughts (the water) into the realization of your desires and goals (the wine). Repeat the mantra "I can change water into wine" to make the invisible visible.

• Become one with your desire through meditation and prayer. Dwell on thoughts of success and abundance until they become your reality. Thoughts and ideas will grow into their physical manifestation.

• An example is a woman who faced setbacks in her business but overcame them by focusing on prosperity and changing her mindset. She made the "water" of her circumstances into the "wine" of success and abundance.

• In summary, true wealth and prosperity come from your mindset, thoughts, and spiritual connection. Focus on contributing value to others, change your perspective, and become one with views of abundance, and you will attract prosperity.

- The woman described losing her home, money, and job and struggling to pay hospital bills. She felt hopeless and that the world was cruel.

- The author explained that she needed to resolve the conflict in her mind between her desires and negative thoughts. Our thoughts and beliefs create our reality, so she needed to change her habitual negative thinking.

- The story of Jesus turning water into wine at the wedding at Cana is used as an allegory. The different elements represent:

- Galilee = your mind
- Cana = your desire
- Jesus = illumined reason
- Mother of Jesus = your emotions and moods
- Disciples = your inner powers and faculties
- Wine = answered prayer or manifestation of your desires
- Water = spiritual power, unconditioned consciousness
- Wine = conditioned consciousness, or your beliefs and convictions manifesting

- The servants who draw the water represent peace, confidence, and faith. According to your faith and imagination, your desires will be fulfilled.

- To change your reality, reject negative thoughts and focus on your desired outcome. Fill your mind with the ideals and convictions you wish to express. Once you achieve an inner certainty, you will see the outward manifestation.

- The conscious mind is the "governor of the feast" - it chooses which thoughts to accept and impress on the subconscious. What is subjectively impressive will be objectively expressed.

- In summary, to change your circumstances, resolve inner conflicts, reject lack and limitation, and fill your mind with faith in the positive outcome you desire. This will allow the "water" of spiritual power to be turned into the "wine" of your answered prayers and manifested ideals.

1. Your good is attracted to you. Cherish and embrace spiritual principles.

2. In Jesus' first miracle, prayer is depicted as a marriage feast, symbolizing the mind uniting with its desire.

3. Love is fulfilling the law. Love is an emotional attachment, a sense of oneness with your good. You must be loyal to what you love.

4. The author explains this to a beauty operator, who then uses constructive imagery in her prayers. She imagines the bank manager congratulating her, her mother expressing happiness for her, and the author pronouncing her "man and wife." Though things get worse for weeks, she perseveres.

5. She understands consciousness is the cause of all. It can become anything desired, like money, health, or companionship. Nothing is hidden; God is within, waiting for us to discover.

6. Within a month, the beauty operator gets married. The author pronounces her "man and wife," as she imagined. Her husband gives her $24,000 and a trip around the world.

7. To develop and manifest material riches: Say, "God is the Source of my supply. All my needs are met at every moment and point of space." Think of how nature provides for all life lavishly. You have always been provided for. Cutting off supply is caused by resentment, self-condemnation, criticism of self, and unworthiness.

8. Affirm, "God is the Source of my supply. All my financial and other needs are met at every moment and point of space; there is always a Divine surplus." Repeat with conviction to achieve a prosperity consciousness.

9. When negative thoughts come, don't fight them. Repeat the affirmation. The negative thoughts will come less and less. You are reconditioning your mind to wealth consciousness.

10. The man in the example did this. His business improved, new opportunities came, and he prospered. You must be loyal to your ideal and purpose in the prayer process.

- You must consistently believe that God will provide for you. Do not affirm your faith in God one moment and then deny it by worrying about meeting your needs the next. This inconsistent thinking could be more effective.

- You must have a clear vision and stay focused on your goal. Do not be distracted by obstacles or setbacks. Stay on course.

- Your thoughts and beliefs shape your reality. If you believe in lack and limitation, that will be your experience. If you believe in abundance, that will come to you.

- We are influenced by the beliefs and thoughts of those around us and our society. But we can reject negative beliefs and condition our minds with positive reviews.

- A young man transformed his life by using the power of his imagination. He imagined himself as a successful singer and then realized his dream. We have the ability within us to achieve what we can conceive.

- Ask yourself how you can better serve others. When the minister focused on helping his congregation better, money flowed in to support his church.

- Your body, face, gestures, and tone reveal your inner state outwardly. You can discipline yourself to portray confidence and joy even when you do not feel that way. Your outer demeanor will then help shift your inner state.

- "Marry wealth" by filling your mind with thoughts of abundance, prosperity, and faith in God's provision. What you conceive in your mind will be manifested in your life. The "children" of your mental marriage will be the experiences and circumstances of those beliefs.

- Repeat affirmations of abundance and prosperity until your subconscious mind accepts them as truth. Speak them with feeling and faith. This will condition your mindset to one of abundance.

- Identify your aims and goals. Mentally marry the vision of what you want to accomplish. This will ensure your success.

That covers the main points from the summary on using your thoughts and beliefs to create prosperity. Please let me know if you would like me to explain anything in the summary in more detail.

- Have faith and confidence in the law of prosperity and success. Do not waver between belief and doubt.

- Your desires and emotions are like Adam and Eve. The idea is the father; the feeling is the mother. They must unite to manifest their aim. Let peace, or God, be the third element.

- Let divine wisdom guide you. Turn your problems over to the subjective knowledge within you. Know that it will provide the answer and relief.

- Man often starts with enthusiasm but fails to remain faithful to the divine principle within him. He gets distracted by external things. It would help if you remained authentic to your ideal.

- The subjective self will bring your requests to pass in its way. Release your requests with faith, like planting a seed. Then listen for the echo or inner response.

- Do not misuse these laws for selfish gain. Use them to help others. Actual power, security, and riches come from within, not without.

- You can enter any desired state through imagination. Feel the wealth and joy of possessing what you want, and it will manifest. A teacher imagined owning an expensive coat for months, then receiving it as a gift.

- Sustain the feeling of your wish being fulfilled. Walk in the light of "It is done!" Stay in the joyous mood of expectancy. What you see in the unseen, you will see in the seen.

- All of heaven's riches— peace, joy, love, guidance, inspiration, goodwill, abundance—exist now within you. Leave your limitations, enter the mental vision, and become one with your ideal. Then you will see it in your life.

- As within, so without. As above, so below. You will see your beliefs expressed. Man is the belief expressed.
