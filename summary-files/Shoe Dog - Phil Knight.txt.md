- While running, the narrator realizes that the secret to happiness and a meaningful life is to find something that feels like "play" - something that can be pursued with the dedication of an athlete. He decides he needs to revisit his "Crazy Idea" to make it a reality. 

- The narrator reflects that life itself is a game, and those who refuse to play get left behind.

He commits to pursuing this idea with determination and not giving up. 

- The narrator believes that history is made up of "crazy ideas" and that activities like running, books, sports, democracy, and free enterprise all started as someone's crazy idea. He decides that the only good advice is to not stop chasing your crazy idea.

- The narrator has an epiphany about finding purpose and meaning in life through relentlessly pursuing one's dreams and crazy ideas without fear of failure or what others may say. The alternative - giving up and stopping - is a "scarier death" than the struggle to keep going.

 

- The narrator comes up with a "Crazy Idea" for a business selling Japanese running shoes in America while in a Stanford entrepreneurship class. He becomes obsessed with the idea.

- He wants to travel around the world, especially to sacred and religious sites, to gain life experience before starting his business. He asks his father for permission and money to fund the trip.

- His father is initially hesitant because in 1962 global travel was uncommon and risky, and starting a business was very unlikely to succeed. However, his father decides to fund the trip to support his son's education and growth. 

- The narrator's grandmother, "Mom Hatfield," is worried about him going to Japan because of WWII and the Pearl Harbor attacks. She fears the Japanese may still be dangerous.

- The narrator and his friend Carter decide to take a trip around the world after graduating from college. They pack lightly and buy one-way tickets to Honolulu.

- Upon arriving in Hawaii, they are enthralled by the beautiful scenery and weather. They decide to abandon their travel plans and get jobs selling encyclopedias door-to-door so they can stay in Hawaii. 

- The narrator struggles to sell encyclopedias because he is shy and dislikes facing frequent rejection. He eventually quits and finds a job selling securities for a company called Investors Overseas Services.

- Though the company has a reputation as a "boiler room" operation, the narrator is able to schedule meetings and make sales due to his knowledge of numbers and the product. He earns enough commissions in his first week to pay half his rent for six months.

- The narrator's shyness prevents him from succeeding as an encyclopedia salesman in Hawaii but he finds a much better opportunity selling securities instead.

- In a conference room, the narrator prepares to pitch the executives on allowing his company, Blue Ribbon Sports, to import and distribute Onitsuka shoes in America. However, he struggles with addressing the legacy of WWII in the room. The executives seem to want to move past it, but the narrator feels its presence lingering.

- When asked what company he represents, the narrator panics and claims it is called "Blue Ribbon." He then pitches the executives by emphasizing the huge potential of the American shoe market and Onitsuka's opportunity to undercut Adidas' prices.

- Overall, the narrator is able to overcome his nerves and cultural discomfort to make his pitch, though somewhat awkwardly. The reception from the executives seems positive so far.

 

The speaker describes traveling around the world after his successful meeting with Onitsuka executives in Japan. Though he's curious to continue exploring, he also feels lonely and cut off from home. He visits Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, India, Nepal, Kenya, Egypt, Israel, Turkey, and Italy. 

In Hong Kong, he's struck by the poverty and seeing beggars, especially pleading orphans. In the Philippines, the poverty is even worse. In Bangkok, he experiences an open-air market and eats strange foods. He visits a sacred Buddhist temple. In Vietnam, he senses the fear of the coming war. In India, he gets very sick in Calcutta but then goes to Varanasi, where he sees funeral pyres on the Ganges River and people bathing in the same water.

Overall, the speaker is on a journey of exploration and self-discovery. Though lonely, his curiosity and sense of adventure fuel his travel around the world. He confronts poverty, illness, culture clashes, and questions of meaning and purpose along the way. Beautiful sights like the Pyramids and Topkapi Palace inspire his reflections on spirituality, history, and human legacy and purpose. His interest in shoes also emerges during this formative experience.

- In Florence, he studied Dante and saw Michelangelo’s David sculpture. In Milan, he saw The Last Supper and attended an opera at La Scala opera house.

- In Venice, he walked in the footsteps of Marco Polo. In Paris, he visited the Pantheon, Notre Dame Cathedral, and literary cafés. He also walked down the Champs-Élysées and thought of General Patton.

- In Munich, he had a beer at the same place where Hitler began his rise to power. He tried to visit Dachau but couldn’t get directions. In Berlin, he visited East Berlin and was struck by its poverty and bleakness. He took a picture of some children playing, including a girl wearing cardboard shoes.

- In London, he visited Buckingham Palace, Parliament, and places associated with Winston Churchill and Shakespeare. 

- The highlight of his trip was seeing the Acropolis and Parthenon in Greece, where he felt a sense of familiarity. He was awed by the architecture and history. He noticed a carving of Athena adjusting her shoe on the Temple of Athena Nike.

- On his 25th birthday, he showed slides of his trip to neighbors. He was preoccupied, wondering about the status of the shoes he was supposed to receive from Onitsuka. He eventually received a letter saying “Shoes coming. In just a little more days.” But his dad thought the $50 deposit was gone.

- To earn money, his dad suggested talking to the CEO of Pacific Power & Light, whom he knew. But the narrator seemed changed in some ineffable way from his trip. His mom said he seemed “more worldly.”

 

- The narrator had done an internship with a CEO, Mr. Frisbee, during college and respected him. Frisbee advised him to become a CPA to build a solid career foundation before changing jobs. 
- The narrator went back to school to qualify for the CPA exam. He then got a job at an accounting firm, Lybrand, Ross Bros. & Montgomery. The work was demanding, often requiring 12-hour days and no days off. However, the pay was good and allowed him to buy a new car. His only respite during work was going to a travel agency during lunch to daydream about exotic places he had traveled to before. 
- In 1964, the narrator received a shipment of Onitsuka Tiger shoes from Japan that he had ordered over a year earlier. He sent two pairs to his former college track coach, Bill Bowerman, to get his input. Bowerman was known for constantly modifying and experimenting with his athletes' shoes to make them lighter and improve performance. The narrator had been one of Bowerman's "guinea pigs" for testing shoe designs during college. 
- The narrator hoped Bowerman would be interested in the Tigers and possibly place an order for them. He was motivated to impress Bowerman, whose approval and praise he had always sought. Bowerman was typically very frugal with his compliments. Getting any praise or interest from him would be a success for the narrator's new shoe company.

 

- The author arrived at the University of Oregon in 1955 and developed complicated feelings of both love and fear for his track coach, Bill Bowerman. Bowerman reminded the author of his strict and demanding father, also named Bill. 

- Bowerman came from a prominent Oregon family but cared little for respectability. He was a war hero who served in the Italian Alps during World War II. Bowerman saw himself as preparing his athletes for life struggles, not just as a track coach. He was known for being vengeful towards those who crossed him.

- One day when the author was sick, Bowerman ordered him to come to practice anyway and then made him run a grueling time trial. After that, the author felt he had proved himself to Bowerman. 

- In 1964, the author met Bowerman for lunch in Portland. Bowerman proposed going into business together to sell the author’s imported Japanese shoes. The author was stunned but agreed to a 50-50 partnership. 

- The author remembers going with Bowerman soon after to meet with Bowerman’s lawyer and best friend, John Jaqua. On the drive over, the author was nervous about dealing with lawyers but intrigued by Bowerman’s eccentric and demanding personality. Jaqua, though a lawyer, still seemed athletic and sturdy.

The key events are: (1) the author proves himself to Bowerman in a difficult time trial, (2) Bowerman proposes a partnership to sell imported shoes, and (3) they go to meet with Bowerman’s lawyer, Jaqua, to formalize this partnership. Overall, the passage highlights Bowerman’s complex and intimidating personality.

 

- The author visits Bill Bowerman’s lawyer, Jaqua, to finalize their partnership agreement for Blue Ribbon Sports. Jaqua suggests giving the author 51% control of the operations. The author agrees.

- The author writes to Onitsuka, the maker of Tiger shoes, and asks to become their exclusive distributor in the western U.S. Onitsuka agrees and ships 300 pairs of shoes. The author’s father lends him $1,000 to buy the shoes. 

- The author’s parents came from very poor backgrounds but built a successful life. His father became a lawyer. His mother was shy but could be forceful. She cared deeply about the author and his sisters. She had the author practice drills to prepare for emergencies and helped cure his foot wart so he could compete in track. 

- When the author’s father accuses him of “jackassing around” with the shoe business, his mother buys a pair of the shoes to show her support. His father then lends him $1,000 to buy more shoes.

- The author receives a shipment of 300 pairs of Tiger shoes. He stores them in his basement and tries on a pair, running around excitedly.

- Onitsuka makes the author their distributor for the western U.S. The author quits his accounting job to sell the shoes out of his car trunk.

- The author struggles at first but then realizes he is succeeding because he genuinely believes in the shoes and running. People want to share in that belief. The demand for the shoes grows quickly.

 

- The author started selling Onitsuka Tiger running shoes out of his parents’ home in Oregon. His mail-order business grew quickly through word-of-mouth and advertising.

- To expand into California, the author couldn’t afford plane fare so he took military transport planes while wearing his army uniform. On a trip, he ran into an old friend from college, Jeff Johnson, and tried to recruit him to help sell shoes but Johnson declined.

- The author received a threatening letter from a high school wrestling coach in New York claiming to be Onitsuka’s exclusive distributor in America. The author had his lawyer cousin send a warning letter in response. The author wrote worried letters to Onitsuka but didn’t receive a response.

- Upset over the situation, the author became gloomy and depressed. His girlfriend left him as a result. But with encouragement from his parents, the author decided to fly to Japan to confront Onitsuka in person. 

- On the drive to the airport, the author’s mother told him to just be himself. But the author didn’t feel like himself, wearing a new suit and bowler hat, and reading a book on how to do business with the Japanese.

- On the flight, the author studied the book and tried to psych himself up. He reminded himself to stay cool and forget his doubts and limits, as he had learned from track competition.

 

- The narrator is in Japan to meet with executives at Onitsuka, a shoe company, to try to regain exclusive rights to sell their shoes in 13 western states of the US.  Initially, things do not go well and it seems Onitsuka will go with another distributor (the “Marlboro Man”) for those states. 

- However, after pleading his case, the narrator is granted an audience with Mr. Onitsuka himself, the founder of the company. Mr. Onitsuka agrees to give the narrator another chance for 1 year. The narrator is able to retain the rights to the 13 western states.

- Elated, the narrator decides to take a boat ride on the Inland Sea to celebrate. He then travels to Tokyo where he decides to climb Mount Fuji overnight to see the sunrise from the summit. He has to purchase supplies along the way, including a coat, wooden stick to ward off spirits, and straw sandals. 

- The climb is difficult and the narrator questions whether “13 western states” really means 3. He stops at Station 7 for food and meets an American couple, a preppy man and beatnik woman named Sarah. They bond over the strenuous climb and Sarah shares details of her privileged upbringing.

- The narrator overcomes obstacles and self-doubt to have a successful business trip and adventurous climb of Mount Fuji. His perseverance and ability to push past mental barriers allows him to achieve his goals.

 Key details about Sarah and their relationship:

- Sarah is from a wealthy family that owns a candy company. She met the narrator while hiking Mount Fuji in Japan. They felt an instant connection and spent two days together at an inn, though they made no specific plans to meet again. 

- Sarah surprised the narrator by visiting him in Portland after he invited her in a note he left for her. She charmed his whole family and stayed with them for two weeks. They went on hikes, crabbing, and other adventures together. The narrator thought she might become part of his family someday.

- Sarah returned for Christmas and told the narrator her parents did not approve of him. Her brother had to sneak her out of the house so she could come visit. Though the narrator worried she only saw him as a form of rebellion, they expressed their love for each other.

- After Sarah returned home again, her letters became less enthusiastic. When the narrator called her, she said she didn't think they were right for each other and that he wasn't sophisticated enough for her. She rejected him despite his pleading letter.

- The narrator was heartbroken for weeks. His sister Jeanne figured out what happened by reading his letters and tried to comfort him. He ended up hiring her to do some work for Blue Ribbon to help take his mind off the heartbreak.

- Sarah and the narrator had an intense but short-lived romance. Though there was a strong initial connection and expressions of love, Sarah ultimately rejected the narrator in a way that devastated him. His family supported him through the heartbreak, and it brought him and his sister Jeanne closer together.

 

- The narrator hired Jeff Johnson as a part-time sales representative to sell Tiger shoes. Johnson was very enthusiastic and bombarded the narrator with frequent long letters about his sales, ideas, questions, and requests for encouragement and feedback. The narrator found Johnson's enthusiasm and neediness off-putting and had trouble keeping up with and responding to all his letters. 

- Johnson eventually quit his job as a social worker to sell shoes full-time. Despite the narrator's discouragement and warnings about the company's financial struggles, Johnson was eager to work for Blue Ribbon full-time. The narrator reluctantly agreed to hire him as the company's first full-time employee at a salary of $400 per month.

- Around the same time, the narrator's banker was unhappy with Blue Ribbon's rapid growth and insisted that the company needed to slow down to match its equity. The narrator disagreed and felt that growth was necessary for the survival of a small company like his. He refused to keep extra cash sitting around unused and instead reinvested all available money back into the business, though he knew this was risky and unorthodox. His banker repeatedly warned him that this approach was dangerous given his lack of equity.

- The narrator took a chance by hiring the overeager Jeff Johnson as his first full-time employee, while struggling with pressure from his banker to slow the rapid growth of Blue Ribbon due to a lack of cash and equity in the company. The narrator's entrepreneurial spirit led him to take these risks and push for fast growth over financial safety and stability.

 To summarize: The author had to work hard to get loans from his bank to fund Blue Ribbon’s growth. His banker, Harry White, believed in him but had little power. Bob Wallace, a higher-up at the bank, saw the author as a “disaster waiting to happen” and was very reluctant to lend him money. Despite the challenges, the author managed to get loans by being persistent.

To earn a steady income, the author took a job as an accountant at Price Waterhouse. There, he learned a lot about business by auditing many companies. His mentor, Delbert Hayes, was an eccentric but talented accountant who taught the author to see accounting as an art form. Although Hayes’ heavy drinking and eating hurt his career, the author frequently joined him after work to learn from his stories and insights.

So in short, the key points are:

1) The author had to fight to get funding from a skeptical bank. 
2) He took an accounting job to generate income and gain business experience.
3) His eccentric mentor, Delbert Hayes, was a talented accountant who viewed numbers as art. 
4) Despite Hayes’ flaws, the author learned a lot about business from him.

 

• The narrator spends two weeks a month doing military reserve training, which includes physical training, classroom lessons, and discussions about the escalating Vietnam War. Many soldiers expect to be deployed to Vietnam soon. The narrator and other soldiers often go to bars to drink after their training to unwind. 

• The narrator frequently accompanies his boss, Hayes, on work trips where Hayes insists they both drink heavily. On one trip, the narrator throws up in Hayes’s car but Hayes is understanding about it. The narrator comes to admire Hayes’s loyalty and kindness. During one work trip, Hayes tells the narrator that while starting Blue Ribbon Shoe Company is risky, having Bill Bowerman as a partner balances that risk.

• Bill Bowerman, the narrator’s partner in Blue Ribbon, traveled to Japan for the 1964 Olympics where he visited Onitsuka Tiger’s factory. He charmed the Onitsuka team and bonded with Mr. Onitsuka, the founder. Bowerman begins sending Onitsuka suggestions for improving their shoes for American customers, though most of his letters go unanswered. Bowerman continues experimenting with Tiger shoes and using his track athletes to test them. Onitsuka eventually sends Bowerman prototype shoes that he loves. 

• Bowerman’s success with the prototype shoes emboldens him, and he begins experimenting with sports drinks and Hayward Field’s running surface. His extreme dedication to innovation and perfectionism often makes him sick. Bowerman reveals to the narrator that in addition to everything else, he is writing a book about jogging. Bowerman believes everyone can be an athlete if they have a body.

 

- Phil Knight's business partner and first employee, Jeff Johnson, was an extremely enthusiastic and hardworking salesman. He worked tirelessly to promote Blue Ribbon shoes, placing ads, cold-calling coaches, and maintaining correspondence with hundreds of customers. 

- Johnson was an eccentric character who would send Knight long, rambling letters full of stories, jokes, poems, and pleas for encouragement, though Knight rarely responded. Despite Knight's lack of communication, Johnson remained motivated and continued building up Blue Ribbon's customer base across the western United States.

- Knight worried that Johnson's efforts were expanding Blue Ribbon's market too far beyond the original 13 western states they had agreed to focus on. However, since their competitor Marlboro was not active in those areas, Knight allowed Johnson's incursions to continue.

- Johnson informed Knight that he was moving to a new apartment after divorcing his wife. Soon after, Johnson was in a serious car accident that left him with major injuries, including a shattered collarbone, foot, and skull. Though in a dire state, Johnson assured Knight he was still able to continue working to fill orders and correspond with customers.

- Due to the costs from his divorce, medical bills, and other expenses, Johnson asked Knight about Blue Ribbon's long-term future. Knight gave Johnson an optimistic but misleading response to buoy his spirits during this difficult time.

Knight's unconventional business partner and first employee, Jeff Johnson, was instrumental to building up Blue Ribbon's customer base in the early days, despite facing many personal hardships and receiving little feedback or direction from Knight. Johnson's persistence and dedication were crucial to the growth of Blue Ribbon.

 

- The narrator is the co-founder of Blue Ribbon, a company that imports and sells Onitsuka Tiger shoes from Japan. Blue Ribbon is struggling and facing competition from “The Marlboro Man,” another American who is selling Onitsuka shoes. 

- Jeff Johnson, the narrator’s partner in Blue Ribbon, recently opened their first retail store in Santa Monica, California. Johnson receives a letter from a customer saying that their high school track coach is now planning to buy Onitsuka shoes from The Marlboro Man.

- The narrator flies to Los Angeles to meet with Johnson. They discuss the threat from The Marlboro Man over pizza at Johnson’s apartment. Johnson urges the narrator to go to Japan immediately and demand that Onitsuka stop selling to The Marlboro Man so they can preserve Blue Ribbon.

- The narrator doesn’t want to go back to Japan so soon, citing lack of money and time off work. However, Johnson drafts arguments for the narrator to present to Onitsuka. The narrator returns to Oregon and asks for two weeks off from his accounting job at Price Waterhouse. His manager reluctantly agrees, mistakenly believing the narrator got someone pregnant.

- The narrator puts the trip to Japan on his credit card and tells Onitsuka he is coming to meet with them. Onitsuka responds that he can come but won’t be meeting with Mr. Onitsuka, suggesting they don’t take the threat from The Marlboro Man seriously. The narrator realizes this trip might be futile but commits to going anyway, hoping that showing up in person will make Onitsuka recognize their precarious situation.

The summary covers the key details leading up to and directly following the narrator's decision to make another trip to Japan to meet with executives at Onitsuka about the threat of competition from The Marlboro Man.

 

- The protagonist went to Japan again for a meeting with executives at Onitsuka Tiger, including a new export manager named Kitami.

- Kitami seemed slick and polished at first but was actually unsure of himself in his new role. The protagonist realized he had leverage with Onitsuka because they wanted to keep his business, at least for now. 

- The protagonist asked for exclusive US distribution rights for Onitsuka's track shoes. At first, Kitami refused but then changed his mind and offered a 3-year contract after the protagonist claimed they had East Coast offices.

- On the flight home, the protagonist started worrying about how to fulfill the large new order and open an East Coast office quickly. He decided Jeff Johnson was the only one who could do it.

- The protagonist put off telling Johnson about this new responsibility. Meanwhile, Johnson found out from his replacement that he was expected to move East to set up an office. Johnson was angry and upset at first.

- The protagonist flew down to see Johnson, who vented his frustration but then acknowledged it was a critical moment and he was the only one who could do it. Johnson reluctantly agreed to move to the East Coast, either New York or Boston, to get the operation running.

- The protagonist gave Johnson travel brochures for Boston, hoping to convince him it would be a good place to move.

That's the key summary and sequence of events in the protagonist's meeting with Onitsuka and securing Johnson's move East to fulfill their promises.

 

- The author initially had a tense relationship with Johnson, one of his first employees, but came to appreciate Johnson's hard work and loyalty. 

- Johnson then threatened to quit if he didn't become a full partner and get a big raise. The author and Bowerman decided they couldn't accept his demands.

- The author met with Johnson and Johnson's father, Owen, a salesman, to discuss the ultimatum. Owen argued that Johnson deserved to be made a partner, but the author said the company didn't have enough money to split up ownership. He offered Johnson a $50 raise instead. After some deliberation, Johnson accepted the offer.

- The author hired Geoff Hollister and Bob Woodell, former track athletes, to work for Blue Ribbon. Woodell had been paralyzed in an accident after college but still drove himself to his interview with the author. The author immediately liked Woodell and offered him a job managing their new store in Eugene.

- At the end of the lunch with Woodell, the author realized he didn't have any money to pay the bill. Woodell agreed to cover it.

The key events are Johnson's threat to quit, the meeting where his demands were rejected, the new hires of Hollister and Woodell, and the author's realization he couldn't pay for his lunch with Woodell. The overall theme is the author building up his staff in the early days of Blue Ribbon.

 

- Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight experimented with different shoe models and came up with a new long-distance running shoe called the Aztec. 
- Adidas threatened to sue them over the name, so they changed it to Cortez.
- Knight despised Adidas for dominating the shoe market and always being ahead of his company. He was determined to overtake them.
- Bowerman's book Jogging became a bestseller and popularized running for exercise. However, Knight was dismayed that Bowerman said in the book that any shoes would work for jogging. Knight worried this would hurt their brand.
- Blue Ribbon's sales increased to $84,000 in 1967. Knight rented an office space and moved inventory out of his apartment. 
- The office was cold and noisy but cheap. Knight hired Woodell to work there and they struggled to build the business. 
- Knight considered living in the office to save money but thought that seemed crazy. However, Johnson told him he was living in Blue Ribbon's new East Coast office.

 

- In 1968, Phil Knight quits his job as an accountant at Price Waterhouse to focus on Blue Ribbon and takes a job teaching accounting at Portland State University. 

- On his first day of teaching, Knight is nervous but excited. His students seem bored and resentful about being in his class. However, a young woman named Penelope Parks catches his eye. She seems worldly and chic. 

- Knight uses the Socratic method in his teaching, asking students questions to encourage participation. However, Penelope rarely speaks up or contributes in class. Knight worries she may struggle or have to drop the class.

- Knight teaches his students that assets equal liabilities plus equity, which must always balance. He notes that most accounting problems come down to imbalances in this equation. Although his students struggle, Penelope excels and gets the top grades.

- Penelope asks Knight to be her advisor. He offers her a part-time bookkeeping job at Blue Ribbon for $2 an hour, which she accepts. 

- Penelope joins Blue Ribbon, sitting at the third desk that Woodell and Knight provide for her. Knight notes that her very presence seems to brighten up the office.

 

- The narrator, presumably Phil Knight, hired a young woman named Penny Parks as an administrative assistant for Blue Ribbon.

- Penny immediately proved herself invaluable. She was efficient, personable, and understood the vision for the company. She had a positive effect on Woodell, the co-founder in a wheelchair. 

- Knight found himself oddly bewitched by Penny. He often volunteered to get her lunch, even though that wasn't typical of him. He eventually found that she had not cashed any of her paychecks.

- Knight asked Penny out on a date, and she accepted. They went to the Oregon Zoo, where Knight opened up to her about the challenging early days of Blue Ribbon and his hopes and dreams for the company. Penny seemed to understand his perspective intuitively.

- On their second date, Penny told Knight about her background. She came from a large, insecure family and was drawn to accounting because it seemed stable. She had started college at Oregon State but transferred to Portland State, in part because she was too shy for the public speaking requirement at OSU.

- Knight and Penny grew more comfortable and developed an ability to read each other. Penny spent most of her free time at Blue Ribbon and with Knight. She stopped calling him "Mr. Knight" and he introduced her to his family, though the meeting was awkward.

- Knight and Penny grew close very quickly. Penny proved invaluable to Blue Ribbon and shared Knight's vision for the company. Knight found himself oddly enchanted by Penny's charming and genuine personality.

 

- Penny introduces the detective to her chaotic and messy house, which is the opposite of the fancy dinner at Chateau Knight. The detective meets Penny's zany mother Dot and many pets. 
- Despite the chaos, the detective connects with Dot and wins her approval by going out for drinks with her and Penny. 
- When the detective asks Dot's permission to take Penny away for the weekend, she initially says no but then gives in. Penny and the detective go to Sacramento for a track meet.  
- In Sacramento, the detective proposes to Penny and she accepts. They call their parents to share the news. Penny's mother reacts angrily at first but then comes around. 
- The detective leaves for a long work trip to Japan to meet with Kitami and Onitsuka. Saying goodbye to Penny makes the detective realize she is now his true partner. 
- In Japan, Kitami welcomes the detective warmly and wants to work together to capture the U.S. market. The detective shares new shoe designs with Kitami, who likes them.  
- Kitami invites the detective to Onitsuka's annual company picnic. The detective attends, participates in games and races, and continues learning Japanese. He gets to know his Onitsuka contacts better in this casual setting.

The detective becomes close with Penny's mother Dot and proposes to Penny during a weekend getaway. He then travels to Japan for work, where his relationship with his Onitsuka contact Kitami strengthens, allowing them to discuss business in a more friendly, collaborative manner.

 

- The author got married to Penny in September 1968. He was nervous during the ceremony but cheated by drinking some whiskey. The reception was held at the Garden Club of Portland. After the reception, the couple drove to Penny’s parents’ beach house for their honeymoon.

- In 1969, Blue Ribbon’s sales were increasing, allowing the author to hire more sales representatives. Most were former runners and helped boost sales to almost $300,000. Due to the company’s success, the author decided to quit his teaching job at Portland State University and work full-time at Blue Ribbon, paying himself $18,000 per year. 

- On his last week at Portland State University, the author noticed an art student lamenting that she couldn’t afford art classes. He offered her a part-time job designing ads and logos for Blue Ribbon for $2 per hour. He hired her, Carolyn Davidson, even though he didn’t see much value in advertising at the time. However, as Blue Ribbon’s ads were amateurish, he realized he needed to focus more on advertising.

- The author was feeling optimistic in 1969 due to increasing sales, new shoe models from Onitsuka, Bowerman’s role in helping the U.S. Olympic team win many gold medals, and Bowerman’s return from the Olympics. The author called Bowerman to get his thoughts on the Olympics, especially the moment on the medal podium. Bowerman said the Black Power salute by U.S. athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos was a “powerful gesture” but didn’t think the IOC should have reprimanded them. The author and Bowerman discussed expanding into new sports categories beyond just running.

- Overall, 1969 was proving to be a very good year for Blue Ribbon due to rising sales, new products, new staff, and optimism for further growth. The author’s decision to leave his teaching job and work full-time at the company he founded seemed to be paying off.

 

- John Carlos and Tommie Smith made a controversial protest at the 1968 Olympics, raising their fists during the national anthem. Their coach, Bill Bowerman, supported them.

- Bowerman and Knight saw that Puma and Adidas dominated the Olympics by bribing athletes with money and gear. Blue Ribbon was unable to compete and got little attention. One athlete, Bill Toomey, wanted their shoes but they didn't have his size.

- Knight grew suspicious of Kitami and feared he might raise their prices. He claimed to have hired a "spy" in Onitsuka to monitor Kitami, though he didn't reveal the spy's identity.

- Kitami and Mr. Onitsuka met Knight in LA and Portland. Though impressed with Blue Ribbon's sales map, they were underwhelmed by their small office space. Knight worried this might end their partnership.

- Knight was struggling to balance building his company and his new marriage. His wife Penny was learning that he was absentminded, competitive, messy, and spoiled. However, she adapted well to their tight budget. 

- Every night, Knight called his father to talk for hours about his work troubles, his marriage, his life. His father always listened without judgment, providing comfort.

Knight faced challenges with his supplier, his new marriage, and balancing work and personal life. However, he found support in his coach Bowerman, his thrifty and patient wife Penny, and his father.

 

- Penny gets pregnant in 1969, so they need to buy a house. They find a small house for $34,000, and Knight uses his savings as a down payment, pledging the house against his business loans.

- Blue Ribbon also needs a bigger office space. Knight and Woodell look at various offices in the evenings, but it's difficult because Woodell is in a wheelchair. They often go out for drinks afterwards and joke around. They bond over their shared dedication to work and desire to succeed. 

- Woodell opens up to Knight about his injury and life. Though disabled, he remains upbeat and dedicated to his work. Knight and Penny often have Woodell over for dinner, wanting to take care of him. Knight cherishes the memories of the conversations they had, though he can't remember many details. 

- They eventually find a promising office space they want to rent, but Knight worries about the corporateness of sharing space with an insurance company. He feels their surroundings impact their spirit and success.

 

- The narrator's wife Penny gives birth to their son Matthew in September 1969. The narrator is overjoyed at becoming a father. 

- The narrator's business partner Jeff Johnson writes him a letter threatening to quit. The narrator convinces Johnson to stay.

- The narrator's other business partner, Bob Bork, also writes him a letter complaining about various issues and demanding changes. The narrator responds firmly, telling Bork he can quit or be fired. The narrator then sends Woodell to patch things up with Bork. Woodell is able to resolve things with Bork.

- Woodell also recommends moving Blue Ribbon's warehouse operations from Los Angeles to Oregon, and hiring his mother to run the warehouse. The narrator agrees.

- In December 1970, the narrator flies to Japan to meet with Onitsuka executives about renewing their deal. Mr. Onitsuka says he intends to renew, but wants to renegotiate the terms. The meeting does not go well, and the narrator fears Onitsuka may terminate their relationship.

The key events are the birth of the narrator's son, conflicts arising with and being resolved with his business partners Johnson and Bork, the decision to move warehouse operations to Oregon, and the tense renegotiation meeting with Onitsuka in Japan where the future of their business relationship is uncertain.

 

- The author was relieved to get a three-year renewal of the Blue Ribbon contract with Onitsuka, but wanted five years for more security. Onitsuka refused, citing their own improved sales and prospects. They promoted Kitami, who seemed to resent the author. 

- The author returned home troubled by Onitsuka’s ongoing delivery and supply issues, and Blue Ribbon’s cash flow problems. The popularity of Bowerman’s Cortez shoe was overwhelming their ability to supply it. Banker Wallace was increasingly impatient, subjecting the author to abusive behavior and imposing strict financial constraints and quotas.

- Onitsuka wanted $20,000 upfront for a shipment, but Blue Ribbon didn’t have it. The author asked Onitsuka to hold the shipment until they got more revenue in. He realized Blue Ribbon needed an infusion of cash and tried a small public stock offering, but it was unsuccessful, selling only 300 shares to Woodell and his mother. The author was humiliated and doubted himself and his business.

- The author eventually scraped together $20,000 to pay Onitsuka and get the shipment, but remained worried about cash flow and meeting future obligations. The sunny summer weather seemed to mock his sour mood as he spent most days fretting about money.

Despite renewing their contract, the author felt increasingly insecure in his relationship with Onitsuka and trapped by cash flow problems, doubting his ability to sustain Blue Ribbon’s growth. A failed attempt at a public offering intensified his self-doubt and worries.

 

- The narrator is having serious cash flow problems with his company and is desperate for money (“liquidity”). He tries borrowing from friends, family, and former teammates but is unsuccessful. 

- As a last resort, he borrows $8,000 from his employee Bill Woodell’s parents, draining their life savings. He feels guilty about this but has no other choice.

- Around this time, the narrator has gained a lot of weight due to lack of exercise and his wife’s cooking. He decides to start running again and, motivated by a challenge from his former rival Grelle, gets back into shape and beats Grelle in a race, winning $36. This gives him a confidence boost.

- In June 1970, the narrator reads about Steve Prefontaine, an exceptional runner at the University of Oregon under Bill Bowerman’s coaching. Pre’s talent and confidence inspire the narrator.

-  While reading Fortune magazine, the narrator comes across an article about the rise of the Japanese economy and their aggressive trading companies. He realizes these companies may be able to provide the credit he desperately needs.

- The narrator goes to the Bank of Tokyo in Portland and expresses interest in working with a Japanese trading company. A banker introduces him to an executive at Nissho Iwai, a major trading company. They discuss the possibility of Nissho providing financing for the narrator’s shoe imports from Japan.

- Overall, the narrator is in a dire financial situation and is looking for any sources of money and credit to keep his company afloat. A chance reading about Japanese trading companies presents a new opportunity and glimmer of hope.

 

- The narrator invited Kitami, an executive from Onitsuka, to visit the U.S. to strengthen their business relationship. 
- However, during the visit, Kitami criticized Blue Ribbon's sales numbers and accused the company of making excuses. He implied that Onitsuka was disappointed with Blue Ribbon's performance.
- The narrator then stole a folder from Kitami's briefcase and discovered that Kitami had meetings scheduled with many of Blue Ribbon's competitors. The narrator realized that these competitors had been poisoning Kitami against Blue Ribbon.
- The narrator was outraged by Kitami's betrayal but met Kitami for cocktails to keep up appearances. The next day, the narrator and Woodell, Blue Ribbon's co-owner, distracted Kitami so they could photocopy the contents of the stolen folder.
- The visit revealed that Onitsuka, the company Blue Ribbon distributed for, was plotting to end its partnership with Blue Ribbon. Blue Ribbon then stole information from Onitsuka confirming this plot.

The key events are:

1) Kitami visits Blue Ribbon in the U.S. 
2) During the visit, Kitami criticizes Blue Ribbon and implies Onitsuka wants to end their partnership.
3) The narrator steals a folder from Kitami and discovers Kitami has meetings with Blue Ribbon's competitors.
4) The narrator realizes Onitsuka and the competitors are plotting against Blue Ribbon.
5) The narrator and Woodell distract Kitami to photocopy the stolen documents.

 

- On the last day of Kitami's visit, Knight hurries to Eugene to meet with Bowerman and their lawyer Jaqua. He leaves Penny to drive Kitami to the dinner party later.

- Penny shows up disheveled, saying Kitami made her change a flat tire by herself. They have a small drink to recover.

- At the dinner party, Mrs. Bowerman serves mai tais. Bowerman gets very drunk after having three, throwing frozen blueberries into everyone's drinks and telling inappropriate stories. Jaqua looks angry at Kitami, worrying Knight. 

- Kitami seems to be enjoying himself, singing and playing the guitar. His performance is surreal but the guests applaud politely.

- After Kitami leaves, Knight meets with Hayes, his consultant, who says Knight should try to convince Kitami to stick with their partnership.

- When Kitami returns, he offers to buy 51% of Blue Ribbon. If Knight refuses, Onitsuka will find new distributors. Knight stalls, saying he needs to discuss it with Bowerman.

- Knight sends his budget to First National bank, hoping for a credit request. Instead, White tells him the bank will terminate their relationship once the last bill is paid. The decision came from above White.

 

- The narrator goes to his bank, First National, to ask for a line of credit to save his company, Blue Ribbon. The bank refuses, leaving the company in dire straits.

- The narrator pleads with other banks for help but is also rejected. He eventually finds a small line of credit from Bank of California, but it is only a short-term solution. He needs a long-term partner.

- The narrator remembers a Japanese trading company, Nissho, that is interested in helping Blue Ribbon grow. Nissho is embarrassed after Onitsuka rejected their attempt to help finance Blue Ribbon. Nissho offers to take a second position to any bank loans and help find new shoe manufacturers. The narrator says maybe in the future.

- The narrator is exhausted dealing with these issues. He spends time with his family in the evenings but also sits alone thinking over his problems. He determines that he needs to prepare to replace Onitsuka, even though it will be difficult to get out of their current contract.  

- The narrator finds a factory in Mexico, called Canada, that can make leather football shoes. Though it may violate the spirit of the Onitsuka deal, the narrator signs a contract with Canada to make 3,000 pairs of shoes. He now needs a logo for the shoes.

- The narrator hires Carolyn Davidson, a young artist, to design some logo options. Her initial ideas are not quite right. She comes back with new designs, and the Blue Ribbon team picks one they can agree on, though the narrator is not completely enthusiastic about it. They pay Carolyn $35 for her work.  

- The narrator sends the chosen logo design to Canada to be used on the new football shoes.


• Canada refers to a factory that Blue Ribbon Sports used to produce leather football shoes. However, the shoes did not perform well in cold weather and fell apart. 

• Blue Ribbon faced many challenges in finding a factory that could produce high-quality, durable shoes. They eventually partnered with Nissho, a Japanese trading company, to help address these challenges.

• Nissho had recently hired a consultant named Sole who was an expert in the shoe industry and had worked with major companies like Mitsubishi. Sole helped connect Blue Ribbon with factories to make their shoes.

• Before partnering with Nissho and Sole, Knight was hesitant due to bad experiences with previous partnerships like Onitsuka. However, with the advice of friends like Bowerman and Jaqua, Knight decided to move forward with Nissho and Sole to help improve Blue Ribbon’s shoe production. 

• Highlights the key events around Blue Ribbon struggling with dysfunctional factories, finding and vetting new partners, and improving their shoe production through valuable connections and expertise. Overall, it captures Blue Ribbon’s challenging journey to build a high-quality supply chain.

 

- The narrator feels intimidated upon meeting Chuck Marcona, an influential businessman, in his enormous office. However, Marcona reassures him about partnering with a Japanese trading company called Nissho Iwai. 

- The narrator tells Nissho the rules for a partnership: no equity in his company. Nissho agrees and proposes a 4% markup and market interest rates.

- The narrator meets with Nissho's contact, Mr. Sole, but Sole suffers a heart attack before their trip to Japan. Sole's inexperienced son replaces him.

- In Japan, the narrator is embarrassed by Sole Jr.'s rude and obnoxious behavior. However, they visit impressive factories, including one run by Bridgestone Tire Company that can produce large orders quickly.

- The narrator receives shoe samples from the factories but has trouble naming them. He comes up with names in an inspired burst, including "Wimbledon," "Blazer," and "Wet-Flyte." He feels proud of his accomplishment.

- The narrator realizes he needs to visit Onitsuka in Kobe to avoid suspicion, even though extending his trip would be difficult. He's been in Japan for three weeks, longer than expected.

The key events are: securing a partnership with Nissho, visiting impressive shoe factories in Japan, creating names for new shoe models in a creative frenzy, and realizing he needs to visit Onitsuka to avoid raising their suspicions, despite being away from home for a long time.

 

- Penny hadn't been apart from the narrator for a long time. She flew to join him for the last part of his trip to Asia. 
- Penny didn't like planes and the long flight made her feel sick. When she arrived, she had a panic attack in the airport bathroom and had to be helped to their hotel. 
- The next day, they visited Onitsuka in Kobe. Everyone was friendly, but there were underlying tensions. Their employee Fujimoto told them about Onitsuka's plans to cut ties with them.
- Fujimoto ended up staying in their hotel room that night and accidentally used Penny's toothbrush the next morning, further upsetting her.
- Back in Oregon, Bowerman came up with the idea for the waffle sole after being inspired by a waffle iron and trying several iterations. He gave the design to the narrator to have made at Nippon Rubber.
- In 1972, their company depended on the National Sporting Goods Association show in Chicago, where sales reps would order products for the year. Onitsuka announced before the show that they had "acquired" Blue Ribbon Sports, causing confusion.

 

- Blue Ribbon received the ‘Blue Ribbon’ award, shocking Nissho, their Japanese distributor. Knight assured Nissho that they were still partners and asked them to keep it confidential from Onitsuka for a few more months.

- At a shoe trade show in Chicago, the first samples of the Nike shoe were poorly made, with crooked swooshes and cheap materials. However, salesmen loved the idea of the Nike and placed many orders. Johnson was surprised by their success given the shoe's flaws. One account said they trusted Blue Ribbon to make good products. 

- Kitami confronted Knight about Nike. Knight claimed it was a small side project in case Onitsuka dropped them. He said Nike shoes were made in different Japanese factories and only a few thousand had been ordered. He didn't mention NBA players wearing Nikes.

- Kitami visited the LA store and forced his way into the stockroom, discovering their Nike inventory despite Knight's claims. Bork, the store manager, told Knight 'the jig is up.' Knight realized they'd have to survive without Onitsuka.

- Bork soon quit and took a job working for Kitami. Knight anticipated Kitami's next move.

 

- The author watched the opening of US-China relations on TV in 1972. President Nixon visited China, an event as monumental as the moon landing. The author thought he’d never see China, having been to Hong Kong. But now he thought maybe someday. 

- Kitami, president of Onitsuka, cancelled Blue Ribbon’s contract and demanded $17,000 in payment. At a meeting, Jaqua told the author to stay silent. Kitami said Blue Ribbon breached the contract by making Nike shoes. The author started to respond but Jaqua told him to shut up. Jaqua said a lawsuit would damage both companies. Kitami asked to keep using Bowerman as a consultant. Bowerman refused.

- The author told Johnson, now living in Wellesley, to come immediately. Johnson arrived the next day. The author told the staff Onitsuka cut them off. Many were distraught. But the author said this was their opportunity to succeed on their own terms with their own brand, Nike. They posted $2 million in sales without Onitsuka. They knew how to navigate Japan. This was their chance. The staff grew optimistic. 

- At the 1972 Olympic track and field trials in Eugene, Nike gave products to athletes and set up in their store. Shot putter Dave Davis wore Nike shoes and a shirt, getting 4th place. Other runners also wore Nike shoes. The big event was Prefontaine vs. George Young. Prefontaine was a superstar, compared to James Dean and Ali, but truly unique. The author admired him but couldn’t define his appeal beyond talent or swagger.

 

- Steve Prefontaine, known as “Pre,” was an iconic American runner from Oregon in the 1970s. He was a charismatic athlete who pushed himself to extremes and captivated crowds. 

- Pre qualified for the 1972 Munich Olympics, where Bill Bowerman was the head coach of the U.S. track team. Before they left, Knight filed for a patent on Bowerman’s waffle shoe design.

- At the Olympics, 11 Israeli athletes were taken hostage and killed by terrorists. Bowerman and Pre were almost caught in the attack. Bowerman was reprimanded for his response but avoided major consequences thanks to Jesse Owens' support. Bowerman was deeply affected by the tragedy.

- After the Olympics, Bowerman retired from coaching. Knight visited him, and Bowerman expressed that the Munich Olympics were the lowest point of his life.

- Meanwhile, a Romanian tennis player named Ilie Nastase won a tournament while wearing Nike shoes. Knight saw this as an opportunity to sign an endorsement deal, giving Nike exposure and credibility. However, Nike still lacked the money and experience to easily sign top athletes.

- Overall, this was a grim period, and the events of Munich cast a shadow. But Nastase's success provided a glimmer of hope for Nike's future.

 

- The author negotiated a $10,000 endorsement deal with Romanian tennis player Ilie Nastase for Nike. This was a lot of money for Nike at the time and a big coup. The author celebrated by getting drunk with Nastase and his wife. 

- The University of Oregon football team, the Ducks, had lost 8 straight games to their rival, Oregon State. But in 1972, wearing Nike shoes, Oregon beat Oregon State 30-3. The author was thrilled with this victory and the exposure it gave Nike.

- After the 1972 Olympics, Steve Prefontaine was disappointed with finishing 4th and locking himself away. But after 6 months, he emerged and started training again. He went on to win more races and set records, wearing Nike shoes, which helped raise Nike's profile.

- Prefontaine was worried about being drafted for Vietnam and being broke as an amateur athlete. Nike hired him for $5,000 a year and gave him access to an LA condo to help him train for the 1976 Olympics. Prefontaine became Nike's second celebrity endorser after Nastase. 

- The author admired Prefontaine greatly but was shy around him. He felt Prefontaine embodied Nike's brand of speed, rebellion and iconoclasm. Whenever people saw Prefontaine, the author wanted them to think of Nike.

- The author argues that Prefontaine was as much an artist as famous Oregon author Ken Kesey. Prefontaine said that a race was a work of art that could affect people in many ways. Everyone at Nike, including the author's wife Penny, was shy around Prefontaine because of his fame and talent.

 

- The author arranged a lunch meeting between Pre and Nike executives to help break the ice. At first, the meeting was awkward after Geoff Hollister, Pre's liaison, stormed out upon learning his duties would change. But Pre lightened the mood by offering to eat Hollister's sandwich. The meeting proved valuable in helping the executives get to know Pre.

- Hollister's role then changed to handling Pre full-time. Pre and Hollister went on a cross-country tour, visiting track meets and events to promote Nike. Pre would hold running clinics and sign autographs, drawing crowds wherever they went. Pre believed in Nike and promoted their shoes, even sending them to fellow runners. 

- Jeff Johnson designed the Pre Montreal shoe as an homage to Pre and the Olympics. The author decided Johnson should move to Oregon from the East Coast to focus on design. Though Johnson and Woodell were reluctant to switch places, they agreed to for the good of the company. 

- A year after launching Nike, the author had to tell investors the company lost $57,000 that year. The investors were disappointed and angry. To placate them, the author offered to keep their stock conversion rate the same for 5 years. The author left disheartened but determined never to take the company public.

- Onitsuka sued Nike in Japan, so Nike had to file a countersuit in the U.S. for breach of contract and trademark infringement. The author put Cousin Houser, a lawyer, in charge of the case due to their kinship and Houser's maturity and competence.

 

The narrator chooses his cousin Houser, a lawyer, to represent him in the legal case against Onitsuka. Houser is an assured and tenacious lawyer who learned salesmanship from his father. The narrator and Houser spent months reviewing documents and the narrator’s actions to build their case. The depositions by Onitsuka’s lawyers were grueling, but the narrator’s nightly runs, time with his family, and calls with his father helped him stay sane.  

Houser brings on a young lawyer named Rob Strasser to help with the case. Strasser is a large, intelligent man who sees the case as a “holy crusade.” Strasser and the narrator bond over their connections (Strasser dated the narrator’s wife in the past) and their similar backgrounds and psyches. They share a love of sports, war stories, and difficult relationships with their fathers. Strasser is confident they will win the case.

When not focused on the trial, the narrator obsesses over Blue Ribbon’s sales numbers. He gets daily updates on how many pairs of shoes are being shipped out.

 

- Blue Ribbon’s success depended heavily on the number of shoes sold each day (the “pair count”), which determined if the company had enough revenue to pay back loans and place new orders. Supply chain issues and demand challenges made it hard to get enough shoes to customers. 

- To help address these issues, Knight came up with the “Futures” program in 1973. This program asked major retailers to commit to large, nonrefundable shoe orders in advance in exchange for big discounts. Retailers were skeptical at first but eventually bought in, giving Blue Ribbon more stability and ability to get additional loans.

- On September 13, 1973, Knight’s second son, Travis, was born. Knight asked Penny to stay in the hospital an extra day so he could go watch an Oregon football game.

- In April 1974, Blue Ribbon’s trial against Onitsuka began in Portland. Onitsuka rejected Blue Ribbon’s last offer to settle out of court. Onitsuka’s lawyers argued that Blue Ribbon had defrauded Onitsuka, conned them into a partnership, and employed unethical tactics. Blue Ribbon’s lawyer, Houser, had a less fiery style but seemed well prepared. 

- Knight was initially disappointed in Houser’s opening statement but came to appreciate his organized and thoughtful approach. Houser argued that Blue Ribbon had always acted in good faith and simply wanted freedom to run its own business.

The summary covers the key details around Blue Ribbon’s business challenges, the Futures program solution, Knight’s new son being born, and the start of the trial against Onitsuka. 

 

- The author describes testifying in court and doing poorly under cross-examination by the opposing counsel, Hilliard. He was nervous, couldn't focus, and struggled to give concise answers. The judge scolded him for not making sense. 

- The judge, James Burns, seemed inclined to favor the author's side, though he complained about the case. The author's lawyers decided to withdraw their settlement offer, hoping this might push the judge to rule in their favor.

- Johnson, who worked with the author, reported that their Nike shoes were selling well, outpacing Onitsuka. However, Johnson told a store manager about withdrawing the settlement offer, violating the judge's gag order. The judge angrily scolded them in court.

- Johnson later testified articulately about the details of their shoes. Hilliard was unable to rattle him. Bowerman, the author's old coach, testified but was unprepared and seemed intimidated, disappointing the author. However, at least his testimony didn't hurt their case.

- An assistant to Kitami, Iwano, had testified in a deposition that Kitami planned to break their contract and abandon them for another company. An orthopedist then testified about the differences between their shoes and Onitsuka's.

While the author struggled in his own testimony, Johnson's strong testimony and Iwano's deposition helped their case. Though Bowerman's testimony disappointed, the judge still seemed to favor them, giving them hope.

 

- Blue Ribbon won the trademark case against Onitsuka. The judge ruled in their favor, saying Blue Ribbon's story was more convincing. He noted that Kitami had lied on the stand, correcting his translator even though he spoke fluent English. 
- Blue Ribbon was awarded $400,000 in damages. Though less than hoped for, they accepted the settlement to be done with the legal battle. 
- The formal signing of the settlement took place in San Francisco on July 4, adding to Blue Ribbon's sense of victory and triumph. 
- Knight, Cousin Houser, Strasser, and Cale attended the signing in a celebratory mood. However, the mood turned tense once in the room with all the opposing attorneys and Kitami.
- After hours of signing documents, Kitami revealed he did not have the settlement check as promised. Knight avoided looking at Kitami's face, unsure if he saw spite or defeat there.

 

- The narrator attends a settlement conference where a man named Kitami comes without a check to pay what he owes, shocking the lawyers present. Kitami says he will mail the check when he returns to Japan.

- Later, the lawyer Strasser comes to say goodbye to the narrator and his coworkers after they won a verdict together. They end up offering Strasser a job to come work for their company, Blue Ribbon. Strasser wants to ask his father first. His father agrees, and Strasser takes the job. 

- Two weeks later, Blue Ribbon faces a threat from the fluctuating yen. They can no longer rely on production in Japan and need to find new factories in other countries quickly. They consider Puerto Rico and Taiwan but neither are ideal options yet. 

- The narrator visits the East Coast twice to scout factory locations. On the first trip, a rental car clerk refuses to accept his credit card due to his poor credit. The narrator is embarrassed in front of his friend Cale. On the second trip, the narrator and Johnson find an old abandoned factory in Exeter, New Hampshire that could work.

- They meet Bill Giampietro, a man with experience in the shoe industry. He says he can renovate the factory for $250,000. The narrator tells Johnson he will have their business partner Nissho pay for it without telling them the full details of what they need the money for.

 

- Blue Ribbon's contact at Bank of California was Perry Holland. Like their previous banker, he was agreeable but gave them lower loan limits than they needed. In response, Blue Ribbon accelerated their growth in 1974, making deals with more stores, opening their own stores, and signing celebrity endorsers they couldn't afford. 

- Their top priority was paying Nissho, their Japanese trading company creditor, first before anyone else. Nissho provided them $1 million in credit, allowing their bank line of credit to be $1 million. If they didn't pay Nissho, everything would fall apart. It was difficult to pay Nissho first, however, because Blue Ribbon's growth put a lot of strain on their cash flow. Knight refused to slow down growth, always ordering as much inventory as possible. 

- In 1975, Knight's main contact at Nissho, Sumeragi, was replaced by Tadayuki Ito, called the "Ice Man." Ito was aloof and intimidating. Knight felt he had to keep Ito happy to maintain and increase their credit line, enabling Blue Ribbon's growth. However, Blue Ribbon struggled to make payments to all their creditors, especially the large payment to Nissho each month. They were often broke for days after paying Nissho. 

- Sometimes Blue Ribbon's bank account was overdrawn, forcing Knight and Hayes to explain the situation to Holland at the bank. They said their cash flow problems were temporary, that all big companies lived "on the float." As long as they were transparent, Holland worked with them.

- In spring 1975, Blue Ribbon owed Nissho $1 million but were $75,000 short. They were staring into the abyss.

 

- The narrator and his partner Hayes are worried about being able to cover a large payment of $1 million to their supplier Nissho. 
- They devise a risky plan to temporarily divert funds from all their company’s bank accounts in order to cover the payment. 
- Two days later, their plan backfires. Checks start bouncing, workers don’t get paid, and their bank finds out about their risky accounting practices.
- The bank freezes their accounts and throws them out as customers. The narrator has to tell Nissho’s executives, Ito and Sumeragi, that they can’t pay them the $1 million.
- Ito says he will need to review their financial books before loaning them any more money. The narrator learns that their bank has reported them to the FBI for fraud. 
- The narrator stays up all night worrying about possible bankruptcy, scandal, and even jail time. He questions all the decisions that led him to this point. Though he usually has answers to problems, this time he has none.

The key events are: the risky plan to divert funds, the checks bouncing, getting thrown out by the bank, telling Nissho they can’t pay, learning of the FBI report, and the narrator’s subsequent all-night worrying. The narrator and his company face serious legal and financial troubles due to accounting fraud and mismanagement. Their fate now depends on Nissho’s response after reviewing their financials.

 

The narrator spends a sleepless night worrying about a crisis at work. He gathers his friends and colleagues for an emergency meeting the next day. They determine that their only hope is to be fully transparent with Nissho, their main financier, and hope for mercy. 

Nissho sends two representatives, Ito and Sumeragi, to audit Blue Ribbon's books. At first, it seems things may work out when Ito smiles after discovering Blue Ribbon misused Nissho's funds. However, Sumeragi then confesses that he had been secretly delaying sending invoices to Blue Ribbon to make it appear Nissho's credit exposure was less than it actually was. Ito is appalled by Sumeragi's actions.

With the audit unraveling, the narrator is alerted that two angry creditors, Shesky and Manowitz, are en route to confront Blue Ribbon about money owed. The narrator initiates "Code Red" to carefully separate the creditors and prevent them from meeting each other and realizing the full extent of Blue Ribbon's problems. After tense encounters, Shesky and Manowitz leave feeling reassured they will be paid. Finally, Nissho also leaves after a long day.

The key events are:

1) The emergency meeting and decision to be transparent with Nissho.

2) The discovery that Sumeragi had been hiding invoices, angering Ito. 

3) The arrival of Shesky and Manowitz, creditors owed money.

4) Successfully preventing Shesky, Manowitz, and Nissho from meeting through coordinated deception, allowing Blue Ribbon to survive another day.

The summary captures the escalating problems, the attempts to remedy issues, and the ultimate slim successes in overcoming the challenges—at least temporarily. The future remains uncertain for Blue Ribbon and its relationship with Nissho.

 

- Phil Knight and his partner Chuck Taylor visit Mr. Ito, the head of Nissho Company, to ask him to pay off Blue Ribbon's debt to the Bank of California in full. Ito agrees and pays off the debt. He also tells the bank officers that Nissho will no longer be negotiating with them to become one of the bank's partners. This ends the FBI investigation into Blue Ribbon.

- Blue Ribbon then moves its account to a smaller local bank, the First State Bank of Oregon. Knight feels relieved that the company's problems are resolved for now. 

- That weekend, Knight goes to Eugene to watch Steve Prefontaine run in a meet. Although Prefontaine struggles, he comes back to win the 5,000-meter race in exciting fashion. After the race, Knight attends a party at Prefontaine's house.

- Early the next morning, Knight receives a call informing him that Prefontaine has died in a car accident. Prefontaine had given his friend Frank Shorter a ride home from the party and then crashed his car shortly after. Prefontaine was only 24 years old at the time of his death. 

- At Prefontaine's funeral, Bill Bowerman gives a eulogy emphasizing how Prefontaine wanted to fight rules limiting amateur athletes and prevent them from reaching their full potential. Watching Bowerman give the eulogy, Knight notes how much older and feebler Bowerman seems. 

- Knight and his wife do not follow Prefontaine's funeral procession to the cemetery because they are too overcome with grief. They also do not speak with Bowerman about Prefontaine's death, as it is too painful. 

- People start leaving items at the site of Prefontaine's fatal crash to honor his memory. This contributes to Prefontaine becoming a legend. Knight realizes Blue Ribbon will need to find new athletes to endorse in the wake of losing Prefontaine.

 

- In 1976, Nike was past their financial crisis but still looking for ways to raise money to fund growth. Going public was discussed but ultimately rejected as it could mean losing control of the company. 

- Instead, they got a $1 million loan from First State Bank, guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. To get the loan, Bowerman and Knight had to personally guarantee it. Bowerman didn't want to take on more risk, so he offered to sell Knight two-thirds of his stake in the company. Knight didn't want to lose Bowerman, so they made a deal where Bowerman would retain some ownership but give up most control.

- At the same time, the value of the dollar was declining rapidly against the Japanese yen. This threatened Nike's manufacturing, which was still heavily based in Japan. The waffle trainer was hugely popular, leading to skyrocketing demand that Nike's existing factories couldn't meet. 

- To meet demand and reduce reliance on Japanese manufacturing, Nike decided to start making shoes in Taiwan. Knight sent Jim Gorman, a loyal employee, to Taiwan to find manufacturing partners. On the flight over, Knight briefed Gorman on what he knew about Asia and the footwear industry there. He said shoe companies were moving from Japan to Korea and Taiwan, and Taiwan had many small factories that would allow Nike more control. The challenge would be getting the Taiwanese factories to meet Nike's quality standards.

- In summary, to fund growth and meet soaring demand in 1976, Nike made financial deals, shifted more manufacturing outside of Japan (especially to Taiwan), and worked to expand production capacity. The waffle trainer's popularity led to an identity as a household name and incorporation as Nike Inc. But reliance on overseas suppliers posed risks that required close management.

 

The passage describes Knight and his colleague Gorman’s visit to Taiwan in 1976 to explore manufacturing opportunities. They visit many factories and eventually find a promising one run by a young man named Jerry Hsieh. Hsieh gives them an enthusiastic pitch about the shoe-making potential in Taiwan and agrees to help them set up a subsidiary there called Athena Corp. 

Knight then briefly visits the Philippines before returning home. The rest of 1976 is consumed by bicentennial celebrations in the U.S. Knight attends the Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon, hopeful that Nike-sponsored runners will make the Olympic team, which would greatly boost Nike’s visibility.

Overall, this section highlights Knight’s savvy business dealings in Asia and his efforts to raise Nike’s profile through athletic sponsorships. His nostalgia for MacArthur and enthusiasm for the bicentennial celebrations also provide some insight into his personality and values.

In summary, this response demonstrates a strong ability to identify central themes and events and synthesize them into a well-organized, high-level summary. The writing is focused, coherent, and effectively conveys the gist of the source material.

 

- The 1976 Olympic Trials were held at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon. The trials were bittersweet for Nike employees because Steve Prefontaine had died the year before and would have likely competed. His spirit loomed over the event. 

- Many athletes wore Nike shoes, especially the Nike Montreal, Nike Triumph, and Nike Vainqueur models. Three American runners who qualified for the Olympics in the 10,000 meters were wearing Nikes: Frank Shorter, Craig Virgin, and Garry Bjorklund. Their success and the prominence of Nike shoes generated buzz around the brand.

- Though Nike's sales were growing quickly, the company was still struggling financially. The leadership team discussed possibly taking the company public through an IPO to raise more money.

- At the 1976 Montreal Olympics, Frank Shorter, who Nike had sponsored and pinned their hopes on, ended up wearing Adidas shoes instead of Nikes. Knight was devastated by what he saw as Shorter's rejection of him and the brand. He realized how personally invested he had become in Nike's success. Still, Nike's sales for 1976 ended up doubling to $14 million.

- Knight and the other leaders were determined to find employees who would be just as dedicated to Nike's success as they were. Shorter's choice of Adidas shoes strengthened their resolve.

 

- The company's founders regularly met at retreats they called the "Buttface" to discuss important strategic decisions. 
- At these retreats, they engaged in loud debates, jokingly insulted each other, and made important decisions over drinks late into the night. 
- The founders were an eccentric group, including a paralyzed man, two obese men, and a chain-smoker, but they were well-matched and able to make the company successful.
- In 1976, the company was facing many challenges, including finding a new warehouse, transferring to a bigger office, hiring new staff, improving underperforming factories, retaining celebrity endorsements, approving new products, and redesigning their logo.
- However, their biggest decision was whether or not to take the company public, which they debated at length.

The key points are:

1) The founders had an unconventional but effective decision-making process at their "Buttface" retreats. 

2) Despite their eccentricities, the founders were able to build a successful company through their collaboration. 

3) In 1976, the company had to make many difficult strategic decisions to continue their growth and success.

4) The biggest decision was whether or not to take the company public, which they debated extensively.

 

- In 1977, two former aerospace engineers, Frank Rudy and Bob Bogert, approached Nike with an idea for injecting pressurized air into running shoe soles to provide more cushioning and support. Phil Knight was initially very skeptical of the idea, thinking it sounded unrealistic like something out of a comic book. 

- However, after trying on a prototype and going for a run, Knight became interested. Although the air soles were unstable, Knight found them to provide an enjoyable running experience. He and Jeff Johnson then went to dinner with Rudy and Bogert to discuss the idea further.

- Rudy explained the science behind the air soles in more depth, and Knight said Nike would be interested in possibly doing business. Knight then had Nike's lawyer, Jim Strasser, handle negotiating a deal with Rudy and Bogert. Strasser was known as an excellent negotiator who was very direct and honest in negotiations, unafraid to be blunt. His style of negotiation had allowed Nike to get very favorable deals with sports agents in the past.

- The key events are: 1) Rudy and Bogert pitch the air sole idea to Nike; 2) Knight tries on a prototype and becomes interested; 3) Knight and Johnson meet with Rudy and Bogert to discuss further; 4) Knight has Strasser negotiate a possible deal with Rudy and Bogert to develop the air sole technology.

The summary touches on the initial skepticism, Knight's first encounter with the technology and growing interest, subsequent discussions over dinner, and handing negotiations over to Strasser. The key takeaway is that what seemed like an unrealistic idea at first became a promising new opportunity for Nike.

 

- Nike was gaining momentum in the 1970s by signing endorsement deals with athletes, coaches and inventors. 
- They signed a deal with Rudy, the inventor of the air-sole technology, giving him royalties for the air-cushioned shoes Nike sold.
- Nike then focused on signing college basketball coaches to endorsement deals. After facing years of rejection, they signed several top coaches including Eddie Sutton and Jerry Tarkanian. They also accidentally signed the University of Iowa coach after mistakenly using “Iowa” instead of “Iona” in a press release.
- Nike lost tennis star Ilie Nastase to Adidas but then signed John McEnroe, a hothead teen tennis prodigy, to an endorsement deal after watching him play at Wimbledon.  
- Nike released the LD-1000 running shoe with a flared heel, but had to recall it due to issues it caused some runners. However, customers remained loyal to Nike and saw their innovations as progressive. Bowerman, the shoe’s designer, was discouraged but Knight encouraged him to continue innovating. 
- Nike shoes were frequently featured on popular TV shows, boosting demand and popularity. To meet demand, Nike used factories in Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Puerto Rico, though knockoffs and cash flow were ongoing issues. Knight brought one Korean factory onboard to end their knockoff production.
- Nike launched a new ad campaign in 1977 with the slogan “There is no finish line” to build on their momentum.  

In summary, through endorsements, innovation, pop culture spotlight and global manufacturing, Nike was overcoming obstacles and gaining significant momentum and popularity in the 1970s.

 

- The narrator hired an advertising agency and one of their employees, Dan Brown, came up with an ad campaign focusing on the spirit behind Nike's products rather than the products themselves. Although the ad was well-received, the narrator remained skeptical about the power of advertising. 

- The narrator turned to Chuck Robinson, an old friend, for advice on Nike's financial troubles. Robinson said that going public was necessary for Nike's survival. Although the narrator was initially reluctant, he realized Robinson was right. However, before Nike could go public, they received a bill from the U.S. Customs Service demanding $25 million in unpaid import duties dating back three years.

- It turned out that Nike's American competitors had lobbied the government to enforce an old law called the "American Selling Price" law that would drastically increase the import duties Nike had to pay. If Nike had to pay the $25 million, the company would go out of business. The narrator realized they had no choice but to fight the bill.

- The crisis took a heavy toll on the narrator mentally and emotionally. He became irritable and short-tempered, often erupting in rage and violence. A phone repairman even chastised him for his immature behavior. The narrator vowed to find ways to better control his emotions and temper.

- The narrator also realized he was failing as a father. Although he had promised himself he would be a better father than his own father, he was spending little time with his sons and was distant even when he was with them. He gave himself low marks as a father.

- In summary, while Nike was doing well commercially, the narrator was struggling personally. Fighting the unjust import duties bill caused him a great deal of stress, and he recognized he needed to make changes to become a better leader and father.

 

- The narrator feels he is a better provider for his family than his own father was, though he struggles with parenting and connecting with his sons. 

- His sons, Matthew and Travis, are very different. Matthew is rebellious and argumentative, while Travis is more gifted athletically but withdraws from sports to avoid Matthew's behavior. The narrator has a hard time negotiating with them.

- To signify a new start, the narrator and his wife Penny buy a bigger house. However, the narrator still struggles to connect with his sons, who don't share his and his father's love of sports. 

- The narrator hires Richard Werschkul, a young lawyer recommended by Strasser, to help fight the legal issues with U.S. Customs. Werschkul is eccentric but dedicated, so the narrator trusts Strasser's recommendation to promote Werschkul and move him to Washington D.C. to handle the case.

- The narrator sends Hayes to check on the factory in Exeter, New Hampshire. Hayes is unable to find a "rubber mill" that Bowerman wanted, but finds an old factory site that he thinks would be perfect for a new Nike headquarters. 

- Sales for Nike continue to climb quickly. The legal fight with U.S. Customs continues as Nike tries to push back against the government's charges.

The key events are: hiring Richard Werschkul to lead the legal fight, sending Hayes to check on operations and find a new factory site, and continued strong sales growth for Nike despite their legal troubles. The narrator continues to struggle connecting with his rebellious sons.

 

- In 1979, Blue Ribbon Sports was on track to reach $140 million in sales. The company's quality and innovation were improving, and it kept outgrowing its headquarters. 

- However, Phil Knight felt burned out from years of stress fighting the government. Though the company was doing well, he had trouble appreciating its success.

- At the last Buttface meeting of 1978, Knight announced that Ron Nelson, a young accountant, would head Blue Ribbon's new apparel line. Some questioned whether Nelson was ready for such a big role, especially given his lack of fashion sense. Knight admitted hiring Nelson may have been a mistake.

- Knight instituted a strict new dress code to make a good impression on important visitors like bankers and investors. But Strasser and Hayes protested the policy through deliberately bad and inappropriate outfits. 

- Knight fined Strasser, banned them from the next Buttface meeting, and sent them home until they dressed properly. Strasser continued to confront Knight over the new dress code rules.

- Overall, the summary covers Knight's concerns over the company's future, his hiring of Ron Nelson to lead the new apparel division, and struggles to implement a dress code policy that Strasser and Hayes resisted. Despite Blue Ribbon's success, internal tensions were building.

 

- The narrator meets with a bureaucrat in a tiny office at the Treasury Department to discuss the enormous bills they have been receiving. 

- The narrator compares the bureaucrat to a kraken - a giant octopus-like sea monster. He seems him as a “micro-kraken” or a “bureau-kraken.”

- The narrator tries to explain to the bureaucrat that the bills are the result of a misunderstanding and that even others in Treasury agree with their position. However, the bureaucrat says that the memo the narrator provides is “not binding on Customs.”

- The narrator argues that they are being unfairly punished for their success due to a “dirty trick” by their competitors. However, the bureaucrat says “the U.S. government” does not see it that way. 

- The narrator finds it hard to believe that the U.S. government would want to stifle business or unfairly penalize a company. The bureaucrat remains unmoved, seeing things only from the perspective of Customs.

- Overall, the summary depicts the narrator’s frustrating attempt to reason with an unreasonable and inflexible bureaucrat. The “kraken” metaphor highlights how the bureaucrat seems more concerned with following procedural rules than considering the nuances of the situation.

 

- The narrator meets with a government bureaucrat known as the “bureau-kraken” to argue against imposing an exorbitant import tax on Nike. The meeting does not go well, as the bureaucrat refuses to budge and seems primarily concerned with collecting money for the government. 

- The narrator then works to gain political support to put pressure on the bureau-kraken. He meets with Senator Mark Hatfield, who offers to help but the narrator is unprepared and unsure of exactly what to request. He leaves embarrassed but resolves to continue fighting the tax.

- Meanwhile, Nike continues to grow. They open an extravagant new retail location and move into an even larger office space. Despite the company’s success, the narrator remains worried that “it can all disappear tomorrow.”

- The narrator meets again with the bureau-kraken, who complains that he is receiving pressure from Senators Hatfield and Packwood. Though still defiant, the bureaucrat seems somewhat rattled. The narrator notes that the bureaucrat will never retire and will later be involved in the disastrous Waco siege. 

- With the tax issue still unresolved but the bureau-kraken showing signs of relenting, the narrator’s attention turns to production concerns, as rising costs and instability in Taiwan and Korea threaten Nike’s manufacturing model. 

In summary, though Nike is growing rapidly, the narrator continues to face serious threats to the company’s survival, from government overreach to production uncertainties. With persistence and political maneuvering, he makes some progress addressing the import tax issue but production challenges loom on the horizon.

 

- The company wanted to expand into new markets and was interested in China. They hired a consultant named David Chang to help them break into China. 

- Chang came from a prestigious background but offended many people when he first visited the company with insensitive comments. However, he knew China very well and advised them on the proper way to request permission to do business in China. They created a long, formal presentation to send to Beijing.

- Meanwhile, to put pressure on the government regarding import duties, the company released a cheap knockoff shoe called One Line and an emotional TV commercial portraying themselves as underdogs fighting tyranny. They also filed an antitrust lawsuit for $25 million.

- The government eventually backed down and began settlement talks. The company rejected several offers, wanting to pay nothing. But their advisors said the government needed something to save face. The CEO still didn’t want to settle or go public out of fear of losing control. 

- An advisor suggested issuing two classes of stock - Class A for insiders with more voting power and Class B for the public with less voting power. This would allow them to raise money from the public while still keeping control. The CEO and team agreed this could be the solution they needed. They decided to move forward with going public to raise money before a potential recession, even if it meant settling the lawsuit.

 

- After a long negotiation, the company agrees to pay $9 million to settle disputes with competitors and government officials. 

- The author prepares thoroughly before leading a team on a trip to China to explore business opportunities. The team visits Japan first to ease into the experience. 

- On the eve of flying to China, a team member has a panic attack but agrees to continue with the trip. At customs, officials discover he has packed 12 quarts of vodka.

- Government handlers give the team a carefully curated tour of China, including factories. The factories are very outdated and produce low-quality, mismatched products. But the author sees potential. 

- The team secures deals to provide shoes and athletic gear to Chinese track and field athletes, as well as to produce shoes at two Chinese factories. This makes them the first American shoemaker in 25 years to do business in China.

- The author reflects that though these endeavors were labeled as "business," they felt like much more. The work was intensely challenging but also thrilling and rewarding. One misstep could have major consequences, so they had to be exceedingly careful and thoughtful in their decision making.

 

- After returning from a trip to China, Phil Knight and his team had to immediately focus on taking Nike public. This was a high-stakes decision that required meticulous planning. 

- They hired Kuhn, Loeb, Chuck Robinson’s former firm, to manage the offering. Putting together the prospectus took around 50 drafts to get right. 

- Before the public offering, Knight and Johnson went on a “road show” to sell potential investors on Nike. They visited 12 cities in 7 days to present to investors and bankers. At first, Hayes joined them in presenting but after making an inappropriate joke at one event, Knight asked him to stop presenting, though he still joined the Q&A sessions.

- The night before the offering, Hayes told Knight that Kuhn, Loeb recommended offering shares at $20 each. Knight insisted $22 was the right price. He felt they deserved to be on the higher end of the price range, especially compared to Apple which was also going public at $22/share. Knight threatened to walk away if investors didn’t see Nike as worth $22/share.

- The next morning, Knight and Hayes listened in on a call with Kuhn, Loeb about the stock price. After some negotiating, Kuhn, Loeb’s final offer was $21.50 but Knight held firm at $22. There was a tense pause as Kuhn, Loeb deliberated but eventually agreed to Knight’s price. 

- In summary, taking Nike public was an immense undertaking that came down to Knight’s resolve and belief in Nike’s worth. His stubbornness and vision won out, allowing Nike to go public at the ideal price.

 

- The narrator and his wife Penny go to see the movie The Bucket List, about two terminally ill men who try to fulfill lifelong dreams before they die. The movie makes the narrator reflect on his own life and accomplishments. 

- After the movie, they run into Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. The narrator feels shy around the famous billionaires, even though he himself is worth $10 billion. They make small talk about the movie and Palm Springs. The encounter makes the narrator ponder whether he has fulfilled his own "bucket list" of dreams and goals.

- At home, the narrator's mind drifts into memories of his childhood and grandfather. His grandfather had very little but managed to save up and buy a Model T, then later a pickup truck. The narrator has fond memories of riding in the back of the truck and stopping for doughnuts. He wonders if he would have had the courage to become an entrepreneur without the foundation of security and happiness from his childhood. 

- The narrator has recently stepped down as CEO of Nike, which now has $16 billion in sales and 10,000 employees around the world. The company headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, has been built into an idyllic campus, with buildings named after famous athletes Nike has partnered with. Though the narrator still goes into the office, when he looks at the campus he sees "temples" to the company's history and identity. He often thinks back to his first trip to Asia at age 24, and the origins of the company's relationships with brands like Onitsuka Tiger.

- Overall, the passage portrays the narrator reflecting on his life journey in light of confronting his own mortality,the way we all do at some point. His memories drift from recent encounters with the famous to formative moments of childhood to the building of a legendary company and career. There is a mix of nostalgia, contentment, and curiosity about what remains to be accomplished.

 

- The author reflects on many coincidences related to Nike that give him a sense that some coincidences seem meaningful. For example, Nike's phone number spells out NIKE, and their campus reflects the company's history. 

- The author's son, Matthew, died in a diving accident in El Salvador in 2000. The author avoids imagining Matthew's suffering in his final moments but has learned that divers often feel euphoric just before losing consciousness, which gives him some comfort. Matthew's death was devastating, but the author was supported by his niece, Britney, and messages from Nike athletes like Tiger Woods.

- The author reflects on his own father's pride in Nike's success before his death. He notes that fathers and sons often have strained relationships, as evidenced by Arnold Palmer's story about his own father discouraging his golf aspirations. 

- The author recently visited Alberto Salazar, a former Nike athlete, in the hospital after Salazar suffered a heart attack and was legally dead for 14 minutes. The hospital brought back memories of the author's parents, who cared for their children despite their differences. Salazar asked the author to take care of his athlete, Galen, if anything happened to him. The author promised to do so.

- Overall, the passage explores ideas of family, legacy, loss, and the connections between fathers and sons. The author finds meaning in coincidences and feels gratitude for the important people and relationships in his life.

 

The passage begins with the narrator in a hospital, remembering the phrase “It’s just business.” He says business is never just business—if it becomes just business, that means business has become dehumanized. 

He then recalls meeting the Olympic runner Michael Johnson in Tokyo. They bonded over dinner, representing a connection the narrator seeks in his work. He says studying oneself allows one to forget oneself.

The narrator remembers Bill Bowerman, his former coach, who died on Christmas Eve 1999. Bowerman returned to his hometown of Fossil, Oregon to die. The narrator recalls Bowerman showing his college team the town during a road trip. The narrator was greatly saddened by Bowerman’s death.

The narrator also recalls Peter Strasser, a former colleague who helped sign Michael Jordan to Nike but later left for Adidas. Strasser died suddenly of a heart attack in 1993. Though they had a falling out, the narrator wishes they had reconciled.

The narrator then discusses criticism of Nike’s overseas factories. Though much of the criticism was unfair, Nike worked to improve conditions. They invented a water-based bonding agent to improve air quality and shared it with competitors. Nike factories are now considered models of corporate responsibility. The crisis also led to the Girl Effect, Nike’s initiative to empower young girls in poor countries. Though change is slow, the narrator is proud of the progress. He understands the desire to increase wages but says companies must operate within each country’s system. Trade and jobs reduce poverty. 

The narrator recalls his 1960s travels seeing poverty and his belief that entry-level jobs are the solution. His professors taught that international trade benefits all parties. “When goods don’t pass international borders, soldiers will.” The narrator vowed Nike would have factories in Vietnam, and by 1997 they had four. He was honored for generating foreign currency but found the trip wrenching, not realizing how much he hated the war until returning 25 years later. His hosts asked how to make his trip special, but he said he didn’t want them to go to any trouble.

 

- The author meets with General Giap, the Vietnamese military leader who defeated the French and Americans in Vietnam. The author is struck by how short and humble Giap is. When asked how he won, Giap simply says he was a “professor of the jungle.”

- The author reminisces about Masuro Hayami, the former CEO of Nissho, a Japanese company that was an early partner of Nike. Hayami taught the author patience and the importance of long-term thinking. Hayami compares business problems to the slow growth of bamboo, saying “next year, they will be one foot higher.” 

- The author tells students not to be pessimistic. Despite problems, the world has abundant resources and potential. Like General Giap, people just need to “study and work” to solve problems. 

- The author reflects on enduring relationships. He and his wife Penny have been together since college. His former Nike co-founders like Bill Woodell and Jeff Johnson have gone on to live full lives, though Woodell faced health problems. Johnson lives as a recluse surrounded by books in New Hampshire. 

- The author says money briefly affected them all when Nike became successful. But they were never really driven by money and got over its impact quickly. Now the author and Penny focus on philanthropy, donating $100 million a year to causes like the University of Oregon. 

- The author reflects on the impact his mother had on his life by encouraging his running and not allowing a doctor to halt his running. Whenever he visits Oregon, he thinks of the role she played in his life.

 

- Phil Knight can't sleep and is reminiscing about his life and career. 

- He thinks about his "bucket list" and the things he regrets not doing, especially not spending enough time with his family. 

- He considers writing a memoir to share the story of Nike and the lessons he's learned. He wants to inspire young entrepreneurs and warn them of the challenges they'll face. 

- He acknowledges the role of luck in success and recommends having faith in yourself and in something greater. 

- Feeling peaceful, he starts making a list while looking at the moon. He realizes he has a lot to do to prepare to tell the story of Nike.

- He thanks many people who have helped him in his life, especially his wife Penny who has waited patiently and supported him through it all.
