- The author, Marie Kondo, is a tidying and organizing consultant based in Japan. She has developed an innovative method for decluttering and organizing called the KonMari Method.
- The key to her method is discarding first by keeping only those things that spark joy. This leads to a dramatic home reorganization and changes in lifestyle and perspective. Tidying transforms people and their lives.
- Kondo has helped many clients declutter their homes. Some have discarded over 200 bags of items. The results of her method are life-changing. Her clients report making significant life changes, increased happiness and confidence, improved relationships, weight loss, and tremendous success at work.
- Kondo believes that when you put your house in order, you also put your past and affairs in order. This helps you clarify what you need and don't need and what you should do in life.
- Kondo offers private consulting services to help individuals and companies declutter and organize their spaces. There is a long waiting list for her services, yet her clients never return for repeat business because the KonMari Method works and the results last permanently.
- The KonMari Method is more than just a technique. The act of tidying sparks joy and leads to life transformation. People become happy when they surround themselves only with things that spark joy.

The fundamental principles, in summary, are: discard first, keep only what sparks joy, tidy entirely and thoroughly in one go, and surround yourself with things that spark joy. By following these principles, you can transform your life and find happiness.

• Most people struggle to keep their homes tidy because they have never been adequately taught how to organize and declutter. Tidying is often seen as an ability people naturally pick up, but it requires intentional effort and training.

• The author loved reading home and lifestyle magazines as a child and was fascinated by organizing tips but struggled to keep her spaces tidy. She assumed that rebound—the tendency for messiness to quickly return—was inevitable.

• The claim that doing an entire house at once will lead to rebound and that it's best to tidy in small increments is a common misconception. In reality, the right approach to tidying can prevent rebound.

• The root cause of messiness is not a lack of skills or time but somewhat mistaken beliefs about tidying, accumulated over years of trial and error. By learning the KonMari Method, people can escape the cycle of clutter and keep their homes tidy.

• Tidying is a skill that must be properly taught and learned. Having more years of experience tidying does not necessarily make someone better at it. Many long-time homemakers struggle with clutter and disorganization because they have relied on ineffective conventional approaches.

• Food, clothing, and shelter are basic human needs, but tidying—keeping a home livable—is often overlooked. Yet it is just as important as the other two. With the right mindset and techniques, anyone can become good at tidying.

- Tidying a little at a time is ineffective and will not lead to lasting change. To transform your space and habits, you must tidy thoroughly and entirely in one go, which the author calls "ikki ni" in Japanese. This dramatic approach produces visible results that motivate you to maintain the change.

- Aiming for perfection by discarding items one by one over time does not work. This gradual approach fails for most people, especially those who could be more naturally diligent or persevering. It is better to aim for perfection at once by evaluating each item and deciding whether to keep or discard it. This focused effort can be completed and leads to lasting change.

- The urge to tidy often arises when people feel pressure or anxiety from another source, like studying for an exam. The tidying provides temporary relief but does not address the underlying issues. True comfort comes from confronting psychological problems, not just tidying the physical space.

- A messy room is a symptom of a "messy mind." Clutter and mess accumulate as a way to distract from underlying issues. Tidying the room provides only superficial order and relief. Lasting change comes from addressing the root causes of the disorder.

- When you begin to tidy thoroughly, you are resetting your life. The visible transformation of your space leads to a profound internal change in thinking and habits. Tidying has far more impact than simply organizing your belongings. It can transform your mindset and daily practices.

In summary, the key insights are:
Aim for perfection in tidying.
Tidy completely instead of gradually.
Address the underlying causes of the disorder rather than just cleaning the symptoms.
Approach straightening as a means of a life reset rather than just organizing your space.
Dramatic tidying leads to profound change. Gradual tidying leads nowhere.

- Storage experts are hoarders: The main problem with tidying is not a lack of storage space or solutions. The real issue is having too many belongings. Adding more storage hides the clutter and doesn't solve the underlying problem. True tidying starts with discarding unneeded items.

- Sort by category, not by location: Tidying by location could be more efficient and effective, such as focusing on one room or drawer at a time. You end up repeating work and never gain perspective on how much you own. It's better to tidy by category, such as clothes one day, books the next day, etc. This helps you see how much you have and make better decisions about what to keep.

- Don't change the method to suit your personality: There is no evidence that personality types require different tidying methods. Most people struggle with discarding items and putting things back in their place. The core tidying principles— discarding unneeded items and finding a place for everything that remains—apply to almost everyone. Tailoring methods to personality types is unnecessary and can make the process seem more complicated than it needs to be.

- Make tidying a special event, not a daily chore: It is more effective to do deep cleaning and tidying as a special event rather than trying to do a little bit every day as a daily chore. Approaching tidying as an event helps motivate you and gives you a clear end goal. It also allows you to see dramatic results from your efforts. Daily tidying, however, often maintains a low level of clutter and only results in a partially decluttered space. Make tidying an event not a daily chore for the most impact.

In summary, the keys to effective tidying are:
Discarding unneeded belongings
Sorting by category
Using a single simple method
Tidying an occasional event rather than a daily chore
This approach allows you to transform your space and establish your desired lifestyle.

• Tidying should be done thoroughly and efficiently in one shot to achieve a lasting impact and avoid rebound. Gradual tidying will not lead to a lasting change.

• The key is to make the process short and intense. It should take about six months to complete. This may seem long but is a short time relative to one's lifetime.

• There are only two tasks in tidying: discarding and deciding where to store things. Discarding must be completed first before storing items. Failure to follow this order will prevent progress and lead to a rebound.

• Before starting to tidy, visualize your ideal lifestyle and space. Be very concrete in your vision. This provides motivation and direction to the tidying process and reduces the chance of a rebound. If needed, look at photos in magazines for inspiration.

• The example client wanted a "feminine lifestyle" which she described in detail as having a transparent floor, tidy space like a hotel suite, pink bedspread, antique lamp, taking a bath while listening to music and drinking tea before bed, and falling asleep feeling spacious. This level of detail and vision is essential.

• In summary, to achieve lasting change through tidying, do it intensely and all at once by discarding completely and then deciding on storage locations. But start by developing a vivid vision of your ideal lifestyle and space. This combination of vision, intense action, and the correct order of tasks leads to success.

- Visiting model homes and seeing different styles can help you determine what you like and the lifestyle you aspire to. The client described enjoys aromatherapy, classical music, and yoga as part of her ideal lifestyle.

- Before discarding items, identify why you want to live a particular lifestyle and what explicitly sparks joy for you. Ask yourself 'why' you want certain things 3-5 times to determine the root reason. The ultimate goal is to be happy.

- The standard for deciding what to keep is whether or not it sparks joy. This is determined by physically handling each item to determine your body's reaction and emotional response. Keep only what sparks joy; discard the rest.

- Do not tidy or discard by location. Instead, tidy by category and gather every item in a class in one spot before assessing what to keep and discard. This avoids wasting time and effort by repeating the process in different locations. It also gives you an accurate sense of your total in each category.

- Remove everything in a category from storage and lay it out to judge more easily what sparks joy. Things out of sight are harder to assess. Deal with one class at a time to speed up the tidying process.

- Mementos spark joy through the memories and emotions they evoke, so start the tidying process with them. But keep only the most meaningful mementos that strongly spark joy. Let go of the rest without guilt.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key points and advice in the selection? Let me know if you want me to clarify or expand on any summary part.

- Tidying by category instead of by room makes the process easier by first starting with the most accessible types. This allows you to hone your decision-making skills before moving to more complex classes. The recommended order is: clothes, books, papers, miscellaneous items, and souvenirs.

- Don't let your family see the items you plan to discard. This avoids anxiety over the discarded volume and sadness over memories associated with the items. It also prevents family members from taking things they don't need, which creates more clutter.

- Frustration with an untidy family often reflects your own room's disorder. Stealthily discarding other people's things without permission is unethical and damages trust. The only space you have control over is your room. Focus on tidying your own space instead of trying to control how others live.

- Tidying your space can improve relationships with family members by reducing resentment over clutter and disorder. But tidying others' spaces without consent will likely damage relationships. Respect others' autonomy and focus on your own space.

The key points are:
Start with easy categories when tidying.
Keep your family from seeing discards.
Only cleaning your space and area may improve family relationships but tidying others' spaces without consent will damage them.

The author initially insisted that her family tidy up and discard unnecessary items. However, after being banned from tidying other people's spaces, she looked at her room and realized she also had many things to discard. She started dumping her excess belongings.

After two weeks, her family started sorting and discarding their things. By quietly working on her own space, she set an example for her family and they followed suit without her nagging them. She realized that once she was satisfied with her room, she became more tolerant of messiness in communal areas and the habits of her family members.

The author used to burden her sister with unwanted clothes and gifts by insisting her sister take them. She later realized this was wrong. While giving unused items to others in need is good, forcing things onto people who don't want them transfers the guilt of not discarding them. People should find out what others need and want before giving things away.

The author compares tidying to meditating under a waterfall. Like meditating under a waterfall, tidying requires creating a quiet space to have an internal dialogue with one's belongings and determine what sparks joy. Excess noise makes this problematic. Ambient music without lyrics is okay, but loud music or TV should be avoided. Evaluating each item is like conversing with oneself through one's possessions.

In summary, the key points are:

1. Set an example by discarding your excess before telling others what they should do.
2. Don't burden others by forcing unwanted items onto them. Find out what they need and want first.
3. Create a quiet space for tidying to allow for an internal dialogue with your belongings.
4. Loud music or TV hampers this process. Ambient or instrumental music is better.

• Follow the correct order of categories when tidying: clothes, books, papers, komono (miscellany), and sentimental items. Start with the easy things first. For clothes, divide into subcategories like tops, bottoms, jackets, socks, bags, shoes, etc.

• Place all your clothes in one spot. Check every closet and drawer and gather every single piece of clothing. Don't leave anything out. Decide what to keep as if you were shopping and picking out items you love. Ask yourself if each item sparks joy.

• Start with off-season clothing which is easiest to make objective decisions about. In-season clothing you're currently using may be more brutal to decide to discard.

• The pile of just tops alone is usually huge, around 160 items for the average person. This shows how much most people own, which can be overwhelming.

• Follow the KonMari Method: pick up each item and ask if it sparks joy. Your tidying and cleaning will proceed quickly if you discard what does not spark joy. Keep only what you truly treasure.

• Putting your house in order is meant to be fun. It's a chance to reassess what you own and express gratitude for items that have fulfilled their purpose before letting them go. The result will be only keeping things that matter to you.

• Even lazy, messy or busy people can learn to clean correctly using the KonMari Method. Have courage—anyone can do it!

•Off-season clothing that does not spark joy should be discarded or donated. Ask yourself if you want to wear the item again next season or if the temperature suddenly changed. If not, discard it. You will be left with only what you need.

•Downgrading clothing to "loungewear" you do not enjoy is wasteful. Most people do not wear these clothes. It is best to discard them.

•What you wear at home impacts your self-image. Wear something you enjoy.

•Folding clothes is the best storage method. It saves a lot of space compared to hanging. Folding also allows you to handle each item, transmitting energy to it. This has a positive effect, making clothes more vibrant and resilient.

•Folding after washing is an opportunity to notice the details of your clothes like wear or fraying. It is a form of dialogue with your wardrobe.

•The best way to fold is to make sharp, clean creases and straight edges. Fold heavier clothes in half or thirds lengthwise, then fold in half or thirds in the other direction. Smooth with your hands after each fold. For lighter clothes, fold in half lengthwise, then fold in thirds in a different order. Keep edges aligned for an organized look.

•Folding properly and putting clothes away gives a sense of accomplishment and a calm mind. Make it a daily habit.

•Once you master the proper folding technique, you will find it a happy and calming task. Your drawers and closets will also stay neat and organized.

• Folding and organizing your clothes, especially socks, and stockings, is an important life skill. Storing them improperly can damage the items.

• The goal of folding clothes should be to organize them so you can see everything at a glance, like books on a shelf. Store clothes standing up, not laid flat. Mimic store displays by folding each item into a rectangle and stacking them. Adjust the number of folds for the height of your drawer.

• To fold, visualize how the drawer will look organized. Fold each piece in half lengthwise, then in half or thirds widthwise. Adjust for the thickness of the material. Finding the "sweet spot" for each item will make folding satisfying.

• Arrange clothes by category and in order of heaviness. Put heavy, dark, and long items on the left and light, short, and thin things on the right so your closet appears to slope up to the right. This makes the space feel more energizing and organized. Reducing excess clothes also helps.

• Treat socks and stockings with care. They endure a lot of wear, so drawer time is their only rest. Don't ball, tie, or cram them. Fold socks over once at the top and stockings in half lengthwise, then in thirds with the toes inside. Roll them up toward the elastic band so they can relax and keep their shape. Find the time to give your socks proper care and respect. Neglecting them means they won't last as long.

• In summary, taking good care of your clothes through proper folding and storage is an important life skill that can save you money, keep you organized, and help your wardrobe last longer. Make the time to do it right. Your clothes will thank you!

To properly fold and store stockings and socks:

• Fold stockings like a sushi roll, with the waistband on the outside. Fold knee-highs the same way. For thicker tights, fold them in half instead of thirds. The result should be firm and stable.

• Arrange the rolled stockings in your drawer so you can see the pattern. Put them in a cardboard box first if using plastic drawers. This keeps them from unrolling and damaging, makes them easier to find and put on, and keeps them unwrinkled.

• Fold socks by placing one inside the other and folding in half, thirds or quarters, depending on the length, to make a simple rectangle. Store them on end in your drawer. This takes up less space than loose socks and keeps them organized.

To eliminate the need to store seasonal clothing:

• Storing seasonal clothing is outdated from when homes lacked heating and cooling. Now that indoor temperatures are controlled, there is no need to pack away clothing based on the season.

• Keep all your clothing accessible and organized based on categories like "cotton-like" and "wool-like" materials. Only store small seasonal items like bathing suits, mittens, or sun hats. You can put away more significant things like winter coats when not in season.

• Avoid over-categorizing your clothing into vague categories like "summer," "winter" or "work" and "leisure." This makes items hard to find.

• If space is limited, use drawers instead of lidded plastic bins to store off-season clothing. Drawers keep contents visible and aired, rather than stifling them. Open drawers occasionally to check on clothing inside.

To store books effectively:

• Remove all books from shelves and place them on the floor before deciding what to keep. This "awakens" the readers and allows them to evaluate what sparks joy properly. It is hard to judge books when they are still on shelves.

• Divide books into general, practical, visual and magazines. Then evaluate each book by hand to decide whether to keep or discard it. Read a book to determine if it sparks joy.

• Imagine how you would feel with shelves of only books you love. Use that image as motivation to pare down to what you want to keep.

• The most common reason for keeping unread books is that you might read them "sometime." However, "sometime" usually means never. It is best to discard unread books unless you have concrete plans to read them soon. Keeping them clutters your space.

• Do not feel guilty about discarding unread books. You have already received value from them by purchasing them. Now give other readers a chance to enjoy them.

• Once you have pared down to books you love, keep them organized on your shelves so they remain "visible" and easy to enjoy.

• Very few people reread a large number of books. On average, most people reread only 5-100 books in their lifetime. Only scholars and authors tend to reread on the higher end of this range.

• The purpose of books is to convey information to readers. Once you have read a book, its purpose has been served. There is no meaning in keeping unread books on your shelves.

• When deciding which books to keep, focus on whether a book sparks joy, not whether you think you'll reread it. Keep only those books you genuinely love.

• Get rid of unread books and books you started but did not finish. The odds of you reading them in the future are very low. Let them go.

• People with extensive book collections are often diligent learners. However, many keep old textbooks, workbooks, and study guides they never use. Get rid of these kinds of books. Donate or recycle them.

• Identify your personal "Hall of Fame" books - those you have read repeatedly and love. Keep these. Also keep books that currently inspire pleasure or joy.

• The "bulk reduction method" involves copying or cutting out passages from books you want to discard and compiling them in a notebook. However, this process often proves too time-consuming and the result is rarely used. It is better to let these books go.

• Having fewer books makes the information you do read more impactful. It is easier to identify what is truly necessary or meaningful. Keep your collection small.

• Apply the "rule of thumb" for papers - discard everything. Most people accumulate far more pieces in the home than they realize, from letters and school papers to newspapers. Go through and discard amounts using the konmari method.

- The author recommends discarding most papers except those in three categories: need attention, should be saved (legal documents), and should be saved (frequently used).

- For papers that need to be saved, the author recommends keeping them in a single container without further subdivision. The key is to reduce the volume of documents as much as possible.

- The author discusses three types of troublesome papers in detail:

1. Seminar materials: Most people never restudy these materials. The real value of a seminar is in attending and applying what you learn. The author recommends discarding all seminar handouts.

2. Credit card statements: Once you have checked the report for accuracy and recorded the information in your account book, it has served its purpose. Discard it.

3. Warranties and manuals: Discard all manuals, as you can find information online if needed. Put all warranties in a single transparent file without separating them. They are rarely required, so sorting them finely is unnecessary.

- The overall message is that most people keep too many papers, and discarding them will not cause problems. We should aspire to empty the "needs attention" box and reduce documents to the bare minimum.

• It is easy to store many miscellaneous items together in one place, but finding what you need is difficult. It is better to sort komono things into categories and keep them separately.

• Keep only those items that spark joy. Get rid of things you've kept for no reason or "just because." Many disposable or single-use items fall into this category.

• Don't feel obligated to keep gifts if you do not use or enjoy them. The purpose of an estate is to be received, not to become a burden. You can thank the facility for its joy when you receive it and then discard it.

• Discard old cosmetic samples, as their shelf life is often short. Keeping them for future trips that you may never take is not applicable.

• Recycle or discard electronic packaging, manuals, and CDs. You do not need them and can find help online if needed. Keeping them takes up space.

• Discard unidentified cords. You likely do not need a line if you do not know what a sequence is for. Buying a new thread is more accessible than hunting for one you cannot identify.

• Discard any broken appliances. Have them recycled instead of keeping them.

• Only keep extra bedding if you have frequent guests. Bedding used infrequently often becomes musty smelling from being packed away.

• Do not keep spare buttons. When a button falls off a garment, it is usually time to stop wearing it. For coats or jackets, if you wish to stay long-term, sew on spare buttons when purchasing the item. Otherwise, you can buy buttons as needed. Most people do not bother replacing lost switches even when they have spares.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key points about komono items? Let me know if you want to clarify or expand on any summary part.

- Discard spare buttons you are unlikely to use. They take up space and serve little purpose.

- Get rid of unused health or fitness products you bought in a craze. The excitement you feel upon purchasing them is what counts. Thank them for motivating you and let them go.

- Toss novelty freebies like a logo pen or paper fan. They provide no lasting joy.

- Put loose change directly into your wallet. Don't leave coins lying around or stash them in a piggybank. Either spend or deposit your change.

- Don't use your parents' home as storage for sentimental items. Either process and discard them or keep what sparks joy. Storing boxes sends problems to the future.

- Sorting sentimental items helps you process your past and live in the present. Keep only what brings pure joy now, not memories of a former self or relationship.

- Review photos and keep only those featuring current relationships and the person you have become. Discard old pictures except for a few special mementos of past growth.

- In summary, clear stagnant or unused items from your space and life to live with greater freedom and energy. Process the past and make room for the now.

• Most unexpected or miscellaneous items are best dealt with by designating a spot for them and sorting them all at once at the end. This is more efficient than dealing with them as you go.

• Photos should be sorted last. Sorting other categories first helps you develop an intuitive sense of what sparks joy. Then sorting photos will go smoothly. The only way to sort photos is to remove them from albums and look at each. Keep only the ones that inspire joy. You'll likely only keep five from a particular trip, but they will vividly bring back the rest.

• The author frequently encounters clients with shockingly large stockpiles of simple items. Excessive amounts of things like toothbrushes, plastic wraps, toilet paper, and cotton swabs. These stockpiles cause anxiety but using them up isn't practical. The best solution is getting rid of the excess. The freedom from surplus and stockpiling is rewarding.

• Sort by category, keep what sparks joy, and reduce quickly. Most people don't know how much they need to live comfortably. As you decline, you'll reach a "click point" where you know you have enough and feel satisfied. The click point differs for each person based on their values and needs.

• Focus on choosing what inspires joy, not just reducing or efficient storage. Follow your intuition. Your feelings should guide your decisions. Don't worry about discarding too much. There will come a point where you'll know what's just right for you.

The key points are to designate a spot for miscellaneous items, save photos for last, eliminate stockpiles and excess for freedom from anxiety, sort thoroughly and quickly while keeping what sparks joy, reduce until you reach your "click point" of having just enough, and follow your intuition to know what's right for you. The goal is choosing what matters to you and brings you joy.

- Following storage methods recommended by others often only works in the short run, leading to rebound clutter. You need to develop your tidying method based on your standards of what feels right. The act of choosing what to keep is highly personal.

- Having excess belongings that you can't discard does not mean you are taking good care of them. Pare down to only what you can adequately handle. Tossing things means keeping your identity and past experiences. Choosing what sparks joy helps you identify what you truly need and love.

- Listen to your intuition about what sparks joy. Following it will lead to dramatic positive changes in your life. Putting your space in order creates a vibrant and happy life.

- Designate a spot for every item you own. This makes keeping things tidy second nature and effortless. Without designated areas, clutter will return. Decide on sites for everything once, and your excess belongings will decrease. Adequate storage is selecting a place for every item.

- Discard first before storage. Most people have more storage space than they realize but too many belongings. Choose what to keep, and the remaining items will fit in your existing space. Starting storage before discarding leads to rebound clutter.

- The author spent years focused on storage methods and made many mistakes. She saw that approaching storage as an intellectual contest to maximize space leads to fighting against your belongings and home. Simplicity is best.

- Simplicity is the ultimate storage solution. Start with discarding to have fewer items, then designate an easy to remember spot for each essential item you keep. A simple storage plan you can stick to consistently is best. Complicated projects fail and lead to clutter.

In summary, the keys to adequate storage without rebound are: 1) Develop your tidying method based on your values. 2) Pare down belongings through discarding to only what sparks joy. 3) Designate a simple and consistent spot for every item you keep. 4) Focus on simplicity rather than maximizing storage space.

• The author initially had the clever idea to repurpose a turntable as a storage solution for her client's salad dressings. However, this solution created more problems as the bottles would slide and fall over every time the turntable was spun.

• The author realized her mistake and concluded that storage solutions should be as simple as possible. Complicated strategies often end up being impractical and unsatisfactory. It is best to ask what works for the space and items being stored.

• Clutter is caused by having too much stuff and not realizing how much you own. Simplifying storage helps avoid excess belongings by making it easy to see what you have. However, even simple storage will not eliminate forgetting about some items.

• The two rules for a simple storage area are to store all items of the same type in the same place and not scatter storage spaces. For those living alone, designate one location for each category of object. For families, give each person their own storage space. Focusing storage in one spot for each person prevents clutter.

• Forget about "flow planning" and "frequency of use" when designing storage. Storage should make it easy to put things away, not take them out. Clutter comes from difficulty putting things away or lack of designated spots. For lazy people, focused storage in one place works best. Following the flow plan often maintains the existing cluttered state.

• In summary, the keys to adequate storage are: keep it simple, designate a spot for each category/person, and focus on ease of putting away, not taking out. Following these principles will lead to an uncluttered home.

First, the flow plan for storing items in a home is not determined by daily behavior or usage frequency. It is mainly determined unconsciously by where things have already been held. Attempting to reorganize storage to match flow plan could be more helpful and will likely lead to more clutter and forgotten items. For tiny homes like in Japan, precise flow planning is unnecessary; simply designating spots for everything makes things easy to find and solves storage issues.

Second, vertical storage is superior to stacking items in piles. Stacking hides volume, crushes things at the bottom, and makes things disappear from memory. Vertical storage reveals the importance, prevents damage, and keeps things in sight and mind. Vertically storing books, papers, clothes, tools, and appliances maximizes space and prevents loss and clutter.

Third, specialized commercial storage items are unnecessary. Essential boxes, drawers, and a person's existing built-in storage features are sufficient. Shoeboxes are highly versatile, accessible, and balance size, material, durability, ease of use, and attractiveness. They have infinite benefits for storing items in kitchens, bathrooms, closets, and elsewhere. Any free box or container of the proper size will work for storage and prevent rolling, slipping, and clutter in drawers and cupboards. Keep only useful boxes and discard the rest.

In summary, let your home and heart guide storage, not flow plans or commercial gadgets. Designate spots for everything with the built-in features of your home and essential boxes you already have. Store items vertically in those spots. Please keep it simple; you'll solve your storage issues, prevent accumulation and forgetfulness, and gain a naturally uncluttered space.

• Don't keep empty bags on the shelf as they occupy space. Instead, store bags inside other bags of similar material or size. This saves space and keeps the packs in shape. Make sure straps are visible so you know what's inside.

• Empty your bag daily when you get home. Have a designated spot, like a drawer or box, to store the contents. This prevents items from getting lost or mixed up between bags. It also gives your bag a break from being packed full.

• Use your closet space efficiently. Store off-season or large items up high. Keep regular clothes folded on the shelf. Use drawer-style containers instead of boxes. Store bedding and appliances on the lower shelf. Group similar items together.

• Get items off the floor and into the closet. Closet space is ideal for storing most household goods. Make the most of built-in wardrobes. Don't try to find alternative storage solutions when you have a perfect closet.

• Keep the contents of storage spaces visible and accessible. Don't hide items away in boxes where you'll forget about them. Store things neatly so you know exactly what you have and can easily retrieve items when needed.

- Organize your closet using storage units like steel racks, bookcases, and shelves to keep things off the floor and make the space efficient. Store more significant items that also take up floor space in the closet. Sorting and discarding unnecessary items can help make more space in the closet.

- Keep items out of the bathroom and kitchen sink area. Refrain from storing soaps, shampoos, sponges, and cleaning supplies in these areas since they get very humid and can get slimy. Store these items in cupboards instead and keep the sink areas clear. Let sponges dry thoroughly to prevent bacterial growth.

- Create a personal shrine or altar on the top shelf of a bookcase for charms, talismans, and other meaningful items. Only keep treats within their effective period and return expired ones to shrines or temples. Carry a limited number of active appeals and keep the rest in your shrine.

- Decorate your closet space with items you enjoy but may want to keep private from others like hobby items, memorabilia, photos, etc. Your closet space can be your paradise.

- Unpack and remove tags from new clothing items immediately instead of storing them still packaged. Keeping packaged clothing takes up more space and the things are more likely to be forgotten. The dress should be unpacked and ready to use when put in storage.

The key ideas are making efficient use of storage space, keeping humid areas clear, creating a personal shrine space for meaningful items, making your closet space private and enjoyable, and unpacking new clothing promptly for proper storage. An organized and decluttered home environment can make you feel peaceful and empowered.

• The author visits clients' homes and finds that many people accumulate excess belongings, especially consumables like socks, underwear, and stockings. They buy more before using up what they already have. Leaving items packaged contributes to this excess.

• It is best only to buy what you need and use items promptly. Remove items from packaging as this allows you to own them fully. Packaged goods take up more space and are less likely to be used.

• Clothes with price tags are like store merchandise and don't feel wholly owned. Tags should be removed when buying clothes.

• A tidy home can still feel cluttered due to visual "noise" from product labels, packages, and boxes. Removing this excess information can make a space feel more peaceful.

• Appreciating your belongings by thanking them for their use can make them feel more alive and turn them into allies. The author's experience of her old cell phone dying after she thanked it suggests inanimate objects may respond to human emotion.

• Treating belongings with care, like athletes do their equipment, can increase our number of dependable supporters. Possessing belongings is natural and helps give life meaning.

• In summary, avoid excess belongings, remove items from packaging and tags to fully own them, minimize visual noise, appreciate your belongings, and treat them carefully. This can make your space and life feel more peaceful and purposeful.

The author discovered her passion for organizing and tidying at a young age. As a child, she was assigned the " organizer " role in her elementary school classroom, a position she enthusiastically embraced. Although she didn't fully realize that organizing was her calling until much later, she saw it was always an integral part of who she was.

The author believes that tidying is an effective way for people to discover their true passions and interests. By decluttering and organizing their space, people can see what matters to them and what sparks joy. Several of her clients have had "aha" moments while tidying that led them to change their careers or pursue new hobbies.

The author herself lacked confidence for much of her life but gained it through her work as a professional organizer. By helping clients learn her tidying method, which involves handling each item and determining whether or not it sparks joy, she built up her decision-making skills and confidence in her judgments. She sees this as one of the "magical effects" of tidying.

Tidying can have a dramatic impact on people's lives. The author's clients report life-changing shifts after implementing her KonMari Method, including new careers, hobbies, and relationships. Letting go of excess possessions can be as important as acquiring new things. The author believes tidying substantially affects well-being more than many spiritual or self-improvement practices.

The author's interest in tidying stemmed from a desire to gain recognition from her parents, especially her mother, as the middle child of three. She wanted to avoid being dependent on others and causing trouble for her busy parents. She sought their praise and attention by waking up early and doing housework. Her passion for organizing developed from a young age.

The author had trouble developing close relationships and trusting others as a child. She preferred solitude and developed a strong attachment to material things and her environment. She still lacks self-confidence but finds security in the things and people around her.

There are two reasons why people have trouble discarding things: attachment to the past or anxiety about the future. These also influence life choices like relationships and careers. Facing your possessions helps you identify what matters to you and gives you confidence in decision-making. It's best to confront them now rather than later.

Tidying up helps people realize how much they can do without. The author's clients often fill garbage bags, sometimes 200 or more. But they always appreciate everything after tidying up. Regretting and discarding something happens, but it is a minor deal. People learn that any problem from the lack of something can be solved by action. They change to see that life goes on fine without those things.

For example, if they discarded a document they now need, they'll first confirm it's gone. Then they'll stay calm and think of alternatives like recreating the document or doing without it. They learn that imperfect solutions or inconveniences don't ruin their lives. Letting go of unused things gives them flexibility and the ability to solve problems. Keeping only useful and joy-sparking things makes life simple and fulfilling.

In summary, confronting your attachment to possessions helps you gain confidence, clarify values, and simplify life. Learning to do without unused things gives you flexibility and problem-solving skills. A life surrounded only by useful and joy-giving things is simple and satisfying.

- The author greets her clients' houses when she first visits to pay respect and ask for help creating a happier space. She believes this speeds up the tidying process. She recommends clients greet their own home when returning each day to build a connection with the area.

- The author sees tidying as restoring the balance between people, their things, and their home. She believes homes cherish their inhabitants and provide shelter, protection, and healing. Tidying is a chance to express appreciation for what homes do. Approaching tidying from the perspective of what would make the house happy can help the process go smoothly.

- The author believes all possessions ultimately want to benefit their owners. She sees a reason why each control came to its owner. Rather than seeing unused possessions as reproachful or cursing neglect, she sees them as simply wanting to leave and be of use elsewhere.

- When discarding items, the author recommends thanking them and celebrating the occasion to launch them on a new journey. She believes whatever is left will return in the same amount in a new form - as a new item, information, or connection. Saying goodbye joyfully and with gratitude helps facilitate this process.

- In summary, the author takes a very spiritual perspective on the relationship between people, their homes, and their possessions. She sees them as deeply connected and believes nurturing these connections through rituals like greeting the home and celebrating parting with possessions can help make the tidying process smoother and more joyful. Letting go of possessions with gratitude allows them to continue to support their owner in new forms. Overall, the author sees tidying as an opportunity to strengthen relationships with homes and possessions rather than diminish them.

Possessions spark joy and vibrancy when discarding those we do not truly need or love. Our living spaces directly impact our well-being. Decluttering and tidying our homes can lead to weight loss, improved skin health, increased energy, and an overall sense of lightness.

Identifying what brings us joy requires carefully observing how we interact with and handle our belongings. Things that spark joy will elicit an instant positive reaction, gentle handling, and brightness in our eyes. In contrast, items that we are unsure about or do not fully love will cause hesitance, frowning, and tension. We can become adept at discerning what truly brings us joy with practice.

Releasing excess belongings and clutter allows us to live in our most natural state, surrounded only by things we cherish. This simple yet profound act may increase our luck and fortune. At a minimum, living in a clean, uncluttered space leads to greater happiness, energy, and comfort in our daily lives.
