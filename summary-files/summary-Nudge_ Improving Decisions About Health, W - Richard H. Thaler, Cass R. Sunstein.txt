 Here is a summary of the key points:

- Carolyn, a school cafeteria director, conducted experiments to see if re-arranging the food items could influence what foods students choose. She found she could increase or decrease consumption of various foods by up to 25% just based on how the foods were displayed and arranged. 

- This shows that small changes in context and choice architecture can have a big influence on behavior and choices. The influence can be for better or worse. Carolyn can use this power to encourage healthier or less healthy eating.

- There are several ways Carolyn could arrange the food:
1. Arrange for the students' well-being (paternalistic) 
2. Randomly 
3. Mimic what students would choose on their own (hard to determine)
4. Maximize profits from suppliers (corrupt)
5. Maximize profits (may make students less healthy)

- Carolyn, as the choice architect who designs how the food is presented, has a responsibility and influence over the choices that are made. There is no "neutral" design.

- Choice architecture and physical architecture are analogous. Just as there is no neutral architectural design, there is no neutral choice architecture. The choice architect has a responsibility for organizing the context in which people make decisions. Many people are choice architects in their roles, often without realizing it.

 

- Architects have to deal with many constraints in designing buildings, including legal, aesthetic, and practical ones.  Ultimately, however, they have to create a functional building with specific elements like doors, windows, stairs, bathrooms, etc. Even small details in a building's design can have major impacts on the behavior of users. For example, strategically placed flies etched into urinals at the Schiphol Airport men's rooms improved accuracy and reduced spillage by 80%.

- The insight that "everything matters" in design can be paralyzing but also empowering. By making even small, thoughtful choices, architects and designers can positively influence behavior. They have to ultimately make specific choices, just as a food architect has to arrange lunches in a particular way. These choices can be used to "nudge" people towards better options.

- "Libertarian paternalism" refers to designing choices in a way that steers people in better directions but still preserves freedom of choice. It counters the notion of "homo economicus" - that people always make perfect, rational choices. In reality, "homo sapiens" have limitations in cognition, memory, willpower, and more. For example, many people struggle with obesity and making healthy diet choices, showing our choices are not always ideal or rational. 

- Libertarian paternalism and nudges can help address these human limitations by guiding choices without restricting them. Even for important life choices regarding health, finances, and more, people often welcome these nudges to help them achieve their own goals. Overall, the evidence shows human judgment and decision making can be quite flawed, suggesting room for improvement from choice design and nudges.

 

1) Humans make systematic errors and biased judgments in their forecasts and decision making. They suffer from cognitive limitations and biases like unrealistic optimism (the planning fallacy) and inertia (status quo bias).

2) In contrast, economists traditionally assume rational and unbiased "Econs". Econs make optimal choices and unbiased forecasts. But Humans are not Econs.

3) Choice architects can improve people's lives by designing choice environments that account for the human tendencies and biases. They can do so through gentle "nudges" that influence behavior without restricting freedom of choice. 

4) Many critics of nudging and paternalism make a false assumption that people always choose what's in their best interest. But people often choose poorly, especially in unfamiliar and complex situations. Some choice architecture is inevitable, so nudges are unavoidable.

5) Choice architecture can be used benevolently to improve welfare. It need not involve coercion. Governments already shape choice through the policies and rules they set. Nudges can help correct for people's cognitive limitations while still preserving freedom of choice.

6) Successful companies and policies often employ nudges and good choice architecture, though sometimes subtly and behind the scenes. Choice architecture has the potential to greatly improve lives at scale. But it also risks manipulation if misused.  Overall, nudges must be carefully designed to benefit individuals and society.

In summary, the key message is that good choice architecture and nudging can improve people's lives at scale, but they must be applied judiciously and for benevolent ends. They represent an alternative to unconstrained choice on the one hand and mandates on the other.

 

- Architecture, like the design of choice environments, is frequently overlooked but profoundly influences behavior. 
- For example, the default options selected by the University of Chicago for employee benefits have significant consequences, so they should be chosen carefully based on what employees would likely prefer if they were paying close attention.
- "Libertarian paternalists" argue that choice architects should design environments to influence people in their own best interests while still preserving freedom of choice. 
- This approach can appeal to both conservatives and liberals. Conservatives value freedom of choice but want to help people. Liberals want to help people but value choice. Libertarian paternalism achieves both.
- Two examples illustrate how human judgment can be systematically biased in predictable ways:

1) People perceive two identical tabletops as being different shapes because the orientation and legs create an illusion. We see what we expect to see. 

2) People's guesses about the dimensions of the tabletops are also biased and overconfident. We think we know more than we actually do.

- These examples show that while human cognition normally works well, it is prone to certain biases and errors. Understanding these tendencies can help improve choice architecture. 
- The key insight is that behavioral economics has borrowed from psychology the recognition that human judgment is often flawed in systematic and predictable ways, even for very intelligent people. We are human, not "econs" (rational beings).

In summary, thoughtful choice architecture and libertarian paternalism are needed because human judgment is prone to biases and errors that the hypothetical rational "econs" of traditional economics do not share. By understanding the ways human thinking departs from the rational ideal, we can design environments that gently steer people in beneficial directions while still preserving freedom of choice.

 

- Humans rely on two cognitive systems: an automatic system that is fast, intuitive and emotional; and a reflective system that is slower, more deliberate and logical.

- The automatic system uses rules of thumb, called heuristics, to make judgments. These heuristics can lead to systematic biases and errors. 

- Anchoring is a heuristic where we start with an initial anchor point and then adjust from there. The anchor can bias our estimates, even if we adjust from it. For example, estimates of Milwaukee's population would be affected by whether someone starts from the anchor of Chicago's population or Green Bay's population.

- The availability heuristic relies on how easily examples come to mind. We tend to overweight events and risks that are more available in our memory. For example, we may overestimate the risk of dying in a terrorist attack or a plane crash because we've seen dramatic news coverage of such events.

- The representativeness heuristic involves judging the likelihood that something belongs to a category based on how similar it is to our stereotype or representativeness of that category. For example, we may wrongly assume a woman is a feminist or that an artist is eccentric based on stereotypes. 

- In summary, the automatic system relies on heuristics which can accurately guide us in some cases but also frequently and systematically lead us to make errors and biases in judgments and decisions. Understanding these tendencies can help us improve thinking and make better choices.

 

The representativeness heuristic refers to people's tendency to judge the probability of an event by how similar it is to their stereotype of such events. This heuristic, like availability and anchoring, is often useful but can also produce biases. In particular, people may perceive patterns where none actually exist, simply because certain sequences seem representative of randomness to them.

For example, in an experiment, people said it was more likely for a feminist bank teller named Linda to be "a bank teller and active in the feminist movement" than just "a bank teller." This is logically impossible, but the former description just seemed more representative of the information provided about Linda. Similarly, if a coin comes up heads three times in a row, people may wrongly assume the coin is biased, when in fact short streaks of one outcome are entirely consistent with randomness. 

These biases tend to make rare but memorable events seem more probable than they really are. They can lead to poor assessments of risk, as when people overestimate the likelihood of homicides relative to suicides, or of dying from a terrorist attack versus the flu. They may also lead to poor policy decisions, with governments focusing resources on the threats that habitually come to mind rather than the most serious possible dangers. 

In general, the key to overcoming these biases is simple: focus on statistics and probabilities rather than individual examples and personal experiences. With conscious effort, people can train themselves to rely less on heuristics like representativeness and availability, and more on careful consideration of frequencies and likelihoods. This may require deliberate adjustments to account for the tendency to anchor on whatever starting value one has in mind. But with practice, the human tendency to spot illusory patterns and make flawed probability judgments can be overcome.

 

- Londoners during WWII worried that German V-1 and V-2 rocket strikes seemed targeted because they were clustered, but analysis showed the locations were random. People perceive patterns that aren't really there. 
- The "hot hand" fallacy in basketball - the belief that a player is more likely to make a shot after making previous shots - is a myth. Players who have recently made shots are no more likely to make their next shot. 
- Cancer clusters, or higher than expected cancer rates in a neighborhood, often scare people and lead to government intervention, but are usually just random fluctuations, not caused by anything. 
- People, including students, tend to be overconfident in their abilities and optimistically overestimate their likelihood of success or being above average. 
- Nearly all couples believe their marriage has almost no chance of ending in divorce, despite the overall 50% divorce rate. Entrepreneurs also usually overestimate their odds of success.
- Unrealistic optimism leads people to underestimate risks to themselves, like being fired, having health issues, or accidents. Smokers know the risks but think they won't get cancer.

In summary, the examples show how the representativeness heuristic, overconfidence in our abilities, and unrealistic optimism can lead to misperceptions of randomness and risk. We perceive patterns that aren't real, think we are less at risk than others, and overestimate our chances of success.

 

- People are prone to unrealistic optimism. They underestimate their chances of experiencing negative life events and health issues. Lotteries thrive on this optimism. 
- Loss aversion: Losing something makes people feel twice as bad as gaining the same thing makes them feel good. This leads to inertia and status quo bias. 
- The status quo bias leads people to stick with their current situation. This is partly due to a lack of attention and the use of heuristics like ‘yeah, whatever.’ Default options are powerful because of this bias.
- Framing effects: The way information is presented influences how it is perceived. This is because people are often passive and mindless decision makers. Their reflective systems do not check how reframing the question might change the answer. Frames must be selected carefully as they are powerful nudges.

- These psychological tendencies—unrealistic optimism, loss aversion, status quo bias, framing effects—show that human decision making is prone to biases and imperfections. But understanding these tendencies can help in designing choice architectures and ‘nudges’ to help people.

 

People often make decisions without thinking deeply about every choice due to limited time and attention. They rely on rules of thumb that can lead to poor decisions. Even for important life decisions, people are easily influenced or “nudge-able.”

An example is drivers taking a dangerous curve on Chicago’s Lake Shore Drive. Many fail to slow down sufficiently and crash. The city painted lines on the road that get closer together going into the curve, giving the illusion of speeding up. This nudges drivers to slow down. 

Another example is a group of people who couldn’t stop eating cashews before dinner, ruining their appetites. At first, they preferred eating just a few nuts, then not eating more. But if the nuts had stayed out, they would have eaten them all, their least preferred choice. This shows dynamically inconsistent behavior, where preferences change quickly over time.

Two factors explain this:

1. Temptation: People's state of arousal or "hotness" varies. When very hungry or presented with appetizing food, people are in a "hot" state and consume more. When thinking abstractly about how much they should eat, people are in a "cold" state. Things that we consume more of when "hot" are tempting. We underestimate how much our desires change between hot and cold states.

2. Mindlessness: People go on "automatic pilot" and behave mindlessly at times. Eating is a frequent mindless activity, leading people to overeat whatever is in front of them, like the cashews. Even stale popcorn is eaten mindlessly in large volumes.

In summary, temptation and mindlessness, interacting with a two-system view of human thinking (reflective and automatic), lead to dilemmas of self-control and dynamically inconsistent behavior. Nudges can help in these situations.

 

- People often eat more or make unhealthy choices due to factors outside of their control, like environmental cues. For example, in one study people ate 53% more popcorn from large buckets even though they didn't like it more. In another, people ate more soup from bowls that refilled without them realizing. 
- These behaviors show that people often act against their own self-interest or stated preferences due to mindless choosing and lack of self-control. Many smokers want to quit but don't. Many people fail to save enough for retirement even with incentives. 
- People use strategies to try and overcome these self-control issues. They set alarms, ask friends for help, or make bets and commitments. For example, in one study two men made a bet to lose 30 pounds in 9 months or pay the other $10,000. They were successful and made further bets to maintain the weight loss.
- Governments and markets also provide ways for people to constraint themselves. Things like cigarette taxes, banning certain goods/behaviors, or allowing people to sign up for casino blacklists. Daylight saving time also acts as a nudge to get people to wake up earlier in the summer. 
- Private companies provide self-control services to benefit both the companies and the customers. Things like Christmas savings clubs allow people to commit to saving money they can't withdraw for a year. Although the interest rate is low, it helps people save for Christmas shopping.

In summary, the key ideas are that people often act against their own interests due to lack of self-control and mindless choosing. But there are private, public, and self-created strategies for overcoming these issues and nudging people toward better choices and behaviors.

 

- Liquidity: Christmas clubs prevented people from withdrawing money for a year. This lack of flexibility helped people save for Christmas gifts by making it hard to access their funds. 
- High transaction costs: People had to make frequent deposits into Christmas club accounts, even though the accounts earned little or no interest. The inconvenience of making deposits helped people commit to saving.
- Christmas clubs flourished because they catered to human weaknesses, not because they were logically appealing. They helped people overcome lack of self-control and temptation.
- Credit cards eventually replaced Christmas clubs by allowing people to finance Christmas shopping. Although credit cards charge high interest rates, they are more convenient than Christmas clubs.
- Mental accounting: People create separate mental "accounts" for different purposes, like rent, food, entertainment, etc. This can lead to illogical behavior, like having money in a low-interest account while carrying high-interest debt. But it can also help with self-control, like keeping "house money" won gambling separate from other funds. 
- Examples of mental accounting:
› A professor who deducts parking tickets and other fines from his intended donation to charity each year. 
› Gamblers who keep money they've won separate from the money they brought to gamble. They see "house money" as different and are more willing to bet it. 
› People who are more willing to take financial risks with "winnings" from the stock market or other windfalls. They see this money as separate from their regular savings.
› Households that keep money in low-interest savings accounts while carrying high-interest credit card debt. They see these funds as serving different purposes, even though paying off debt would be logical.
› Some people create separate accounts for vacations, children's college, retirement, etc. This can lead to irrational behavior but also helps with self-control.
› A man named Dennis who treats his Social Security checks as "mad money" for enjoyment since he's been such a diligent saver. This is an example of a mental accounting strategy to promote spending.

 

Dennis wanted to enjoy his retirement and not delay spending on fun activities. So he set up a separate account for his Social Security payments that he designated as his “fun account.” Money in this account could be used for enjoyable purchases like fancy bikes or wine, but not necessary expenses like roof repairs. The summary suggests that mental accounts like Dennis's can help make life more enjoyable and secure. 

The chapter then discusses how humans are prone to follow the herd and be socially influenced. It gives several examples, like:

1. Teenage girls are more likely to get pregnant if they see other teens having babies. 
2. Obesity can spread through social networks. 
3. Broadcasters often copy each other, leading to trends in TV programming.
4. College students' academic performance is influenced by their peers.
5. Federal judges' rulings are influenced by the votes of judges on their panel.

There are two reasons why humans follow the herd:

1. We like to conform to groups. In experiments where people had to match lines of different lengths, participants would frequently give the same incorrect answer as the rest of the group, going against the evidence of their senses. This tendency to conform has been found across many countries and cultures.

2. The statements and actions of others provide information. If many people do or think something, we may assume they know something we don't and follow them.

In summary, humans are prone to follow the herd through a desire to conform and because we use the behavior of others as a source of information. Choice architects need to understand how to encourage beneficial social behavior and discourage harmful behavior.

 Here is a summary of the passage:

- People are prone to conform to the judgments and behaviors of others, especially unanimous groups. This is because:
1) Brain scans show that conformity actually changes how people perceive the situation. 
2) People conform more when they know others can see their answers. They want to avoid seeming different.
3) Unanimous groups provide the strongest pressure to conform, even on easy questions with obvious answers.

- Muzafer Sherif’s experiments showed how groups develop arbitrary but stable judgments and how those judgments spread to new group members. An early “nudge” from a confident group member could have a big influence. 
- Judgments and traditions spread through “pluralistic ignorance”—people following them not because they agree but because they think others do. 

- Additional experiments found conformity effects for many types of judgments. People adopted surprising views and priorities when exposed to an apparent group consensus.

- The “spotlight effect” refers to people's tendency to overestimate how much others notice and pay attention to them. This contributes to conformity and concern for social norms. In reality, others do not scrutinize individuals as much as they think.

- A creative anti-littering campaign in Texas (“Don’t Mess With Texas”) successfully reduced littering by appealing to state pride and using popular celebrities. It illustrates how nudges from influential groups can change behavior.

In summary, people are prone to follow the crowd due to a desire for acceptance, an assumption that the group’s views are correct, and an overestimation of how much others monitor them. But with the right approach, these same social forces can be harnessed to nudge people in positive directions.

 

- In the late 1990s, researchers conducted an experiment to see how much attention people pay to t-shirts. They had people wear t-shirts with Barry Manilow's face on them and join a group. On average, people guessed that 46% of the group would notice and identify Manilow, but in reality only 21% did. This shows that people overestimate how much attention others are paying to them. 

- Because people think others are watching them more closely, they are more prone to conform to social norms. This can influence culture, politics, and business. For example, an experiment with music downloads showed that people are more likely to download songs that others have already downloaded, leading to unpredictability in which songs become popular. Success and failure can depend a lot on early adopters.

- The "Seattle Windshield Pitting Epidemic" of 1954 shows how social influences can spread even without any orchestration. Thousands of people reported windshield damage, but it turned out there was no real damage or cause. It was a kind of social contagion, fueled by media coverage and speculation. 

- We are also greatly influenced in subtle ways, like how much we eat. People eat much more when eating with others, and tend to match how much others are eating. Advertisers and politicians frequently try to take advantage of social influences by suggesting that "most people prefer" or are "turning to" their product or candidate. They are trying to trigger cascades of imitation. 

- In the end, while we view ourselves as making independent judgments, we are often just imitating others without realizing it. No one wants to admit they chose a candidate just because others did first. But social nudges and cascades of imitation are a big part of human decision making.

 

- People's behavior is influenced by what they perceive others around them are doing. This is known as conformity.
- An experiment in Minnesota found that informing people that 90% of others comply with tax laws increased tax compliance. 
- A study in Petrified Forest National Park found that signs emphasizing that most visitors do not remove petrified wood were more effective at preventing wood removal than signs just prohibiting removal. 
- Surveys show most college students binge drink less than commonly perceived. Campaigns emphasizing the actual lower rates of drinking have decreased student binge drinking.
- An experiment providing households information on neighborhood energy usage and emoticons as feedback decreased energy usage in above-average users and prevented increase in below-average users.
- Priming refers to how subtle cues can influence the ease of bringing certain information to mind and thus influence behavior. Surveys measuring people's intentions and behavior have been shown to then affect that behavior, known as the mere-measurement effect. Asking people if they intend to vote or buy a product increases the likelihood they will do so.

The key lessons are:

1) People conform to perceived social norms. Correcting misperceptions about actual norms can positively influence behavior. 
2) Subtle social cues, like emoticons or survey questions, can prime certain responses and behaviors. This priming effect can be harnessed as a nudge.
3) The mere-measurement effect shows that measuring intentions often affects behavior. Asking about people's intentions to do something makes them more likely to then act on those intentions.

 

• People need nudges for choices that are difficult and infrequent, for which they get little feedback or opportunity to learn. Such choices include:

- Investment goods (e.g. exercising, dieting): Costs are immediate but benefits are delayed. People tend to underinvest in these. 

- Sinful goods (e.g. smoking, drinking): Benefits are immediate but costs are delayed. People tend to overinvest in these.

- Complex choices (e.g. mortgages, marriages): People have little experience or practice with these high-stakes choices.

• The stakes of a choice and opportunities to practice don’t seem to improve people’s decision-making much. Economics aims to explain important life decisions, yet these provide little chance to practice.

• While the free market works well for simple, frequent choices (e.g. groceries), it struggles with choices involving self-control or complexity. Companies often profit from, rather than fix, people’s flaws and foibles.

• Nudges should aim to help those most prone to error and do little harm to others following the “golden rule of libertarian paternalism.” The level of nudging should match the difficulty of the choice.

• Governments should not dictate people’s complex life choices but can improve choice environments so people better achieve their own goals. The key is aligning free choice and human well-being.

 

- Rare, difficult choices that lack feedback are good candidates for nudges. People often struggle with choices that have delayed consequences, are complex or infrequent, and don't provide good feedback. 

- Learning requires opportunities for repetition and clear feedback. Without feedback, people can make the same mistakes repeatedly without improving. Many important life choices, like choosing a career path, lack good feedback and practice opportunities.

- People often have trouble determining what they will actually like or prefer in unfamiliar domains. They rely on advice and recommendations from others with more experience. Some businesses recognize this and limit customer choice, allowing experts to guide them.

- While free markets often help guide choice, they sometimes fail or are manipulated. Markets work best when consumers can determine quality and there is competition. But for some complex products like insurance, it can be hard for consumers to evaluate options and companies have incentives to exploit behavioral biases. Some government intervention may be needed in these cases.

- The summary provides several examples to illustrate these points, including practicing putting without being able to see where the balls go, choosing an unfamiliar cuisine, selecting a mutual fund, and purchasing insurance. The key message is that nudges can helpfully guide people when free choice and markets fail or lead to poor outcomes.

 

- Humans are prone to make predictable mistakes and errors in judgment due to psychological biases and the complex interplay between our automatic and reflective systems. 

- “Choice architecture” refers to the design of how options and information are presented to influence the choices people make. Choice architects, whether intentionally or not, design environments and experiences that shape how people make choices.

- “Defaults” refer to the options that are pre-selected if a person takes no action. Defaults are very powerful because many people will passively accept the default due to inertia, status quo bias, and the desire to take the path of least resistance. Defaults should be selected carefully since they strongly influence choice.

- Other principles of good choice architecture include:

1) Understanding “stimulus-response compatibility” - signals and cues should be designed to elicit the desired intuitive responses. For example, big handles indicate “pull”, while flat plates indicate “push”.

2) Accounting for cognitive limitations - don’t overload people with too much complex information or too many options. Simplify when possible. 

3) Using salient and vivid information - we pay more attention to information that is striking or emotionally interesting. Choice architects can use this to draw attention to certain options or information.

4) Grouping options and providing feedback - categorizing or bundling similar options together makes choice easier. People also make better choices when feedback about their selections is provided.

5) Incentives - for better or worse, incentives powerfully influence our choices. Choice architects should design incentive systems carefully and be aware of their potentially complex effects.

The key message is that choice architecture is inescapable, so we must thoughtfully design environments, products, and experiences that empower people and help them avoid errors. By understanding human psychology, choice architects can craft experiences and interfaces that make it easier for people to choose what is really in their best interest.

 

- Defaults are inevitable and the choice of default options can be controversial. Required choice, where choosers are forced to make an active choice, is sometimes preferable but not always feasible or helpful, especially for complex choices. 

- Well-designed systems expect and forgive user errors. Examples include:

1. The Paris Metro ticket machines that accept tickets inserted in either orientation. This contrasts with parking garage payment machines that require exact card orientation and often lead to user frustration and delay.

2. Modern automobiles have many error-preventing and error-forgiving features like seat belt reminders, low fuel warnings, automatic headlights, and gas caps attached by plastic cords. These anticipate and mitigate predictable "postcompletion errors" where people forget steps after completing a main task.

3. Diesel fuel nozzles are too large to fit in gasoline car fuel tanks, preventing the mistake of putting the wrong fuel in the tank (though the opposite error is still possible). This is an example of a "forcing function" where you have to do one thing (use the correct nozzle) to get what you want (fuel your vehicle).

So in summary, good choice architecture incorporates error anticipation and forgiveness to create systems that are easy to use, minimize frustration, and prevent consequential mistakes. Required choosing and forcing functions can also help but must be applied judiciously based on the complexity and nature of the choice.

 

- Human error, rather than equipment failure, causes the majority of critical incidents in health care. A common error was connecting the wrong drug to an IV line, delivering the incorrect medication. This was solved by designing equipment so that the connectors for different drugs were incompatible, making the error physically impossible.

- Drug compliance is an issue, especially for elderly patients on multiple medications. The ideal solution is a once-daily dose. More frequent doses increase the opportunity for error. Regular schedules, like every morning, are easier for people to turn into habits. Placebo pills are sometimes used on birth control pill regimens so that the person takes a pill every day to build the habit.

- Providing feedback to people about their performance and mistakes helps them improve. Digital cameras give instant feedback by showing the photo just taken. Fake shutter sounds provide audio feedback. Warnings about low batteries or suspicious email attachments provide feedback, but too many warnings will be ignored. The color-coded terror alert system provides useless feedback.

- The mapping between a choice and the outcome is easy for some decisions, like choosing an ice cream flavor, but hard for others, like choosing a medical treatment. Good choice architecture helps people improve their ability to map by making information more comprehensible. For example, stating the largest recommended print size for a digital camera is more useful than listing the megapixels. 

- In summary, designing systems and environments to account for human errors and limitations can help people make better choices and have better outcomes. Feedback, simplifying information, building good habits, and making errors physically impossible are all strategies that can be employed.

 

- Photo sizes commonly offered are: 
4 × 6 inches (small), 
9 × 12 inches (medium),
and “poster size” (large)

- It can be difficult for people to determine how much different products and services actually cost due to complex pricing schemes. Examples include credit cards, cell phone plans, mortgages, and insurance policies.

- A proposed solution is “recap” regulation:

- Record: Require companies to disclose all fees, rates, and formulas in a spreadsheet format.
- Evaluate: Require companies to provide customers with an annual report of all charges incurred. 
- Compare Alternative Prices: Allow third-party websites to use this data to easily compare offers from different companies.

- As choices become more numerous and complex, people tend to adopt simplifying strategies to navigate them, like “elimination by aspects.” This makes choice architecture more impactful.

- Examples of helpful choice architecture include:

- Organizing similar options together (like paint colors)
- Offering tools to filter and discover options (like on Netflix)
- Using “collaborative filtering” to provide recommendations based on what similar people like 

- Surprise and discovering new options is still valuable. Relying only on what “people like you” like can be limiting.

 

- Americans currently have a very low personal savings rate, with many not saving anything for retirement. 
- The lack of personal savings exacerbates problems with the Social Security system and people's financial security in retirement.
- The government has tried to encourage more personal saving through tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s, but many people do not take full advantage of these programs.
- Two suggestions to help increase personal saving:

1. Automatic enrollment in savings plans: Automatically enroll people in retirement savings plans like 401(k)s, with the option to opt out. This helps overcome people's inertia and tendency to procrastinate.

2. The Save More Tomorrow program: This program automatically increases people's contribution rates to retirement savings plans like 401(k)s each time they get a raise. This helps address the fact that people tend to spend additional income rather than save it. By saving the increases, people largely avoid a drop in their take-home pay. 

- These nudges work because they account for the human tendencies to procrastinate and spend rather than save additional income. Traditional economic theory fails to account for these tendencies and assumes people logically save for retirement.

- The key reasons people fail to save adequately are:

1. Inertia and procrastination: People have good intentions to save but lack the willpower to follow through. Automatic enrollment helps overcome this.

2. Spending biases: When people get raises, they tend to spend the additional money rather than save it. The Save More Tomorrow program helps address this bias.

3. Lack of self-control: People have trouble exercising restraint and saving money now for the future. Nudges can help impose restraint and guide people to better long-term choices.

4. Short-sightedness: People tend to overly focus on the short-term rather than plan properly for the long-term future. Nudges help encourage more long-term thinking.

So in summary, nudges that account for these human tendencies and that make it easy for people to do the right thing can be effective in encouraging better retirement saving behavior.

 

- The standard economic theory of saving for retirement assumes people rationally calculate how much they need to save and have the willpower to follow through. 
- In reality, this is difficult for most people to do because the calculations are complicated and people often lack the willpower.  
- For most of history, people did not have to save for retirement because they did not live long enough or their children cared for them. Now, government and employers have programs to help.
- Early programs were mostly "defined benefit" where people got a fixed benefit based on their salary and years of work. These are easy for people but inflexible. 
- Most programs now are "defined contribution" like 401(k)s where people choose how much to save and invest. These give more choice but require more work and guidance.
- It is hard to say if people are saving enough. Economists disagree on how much is needed and some people clearly save too little. However, saving too little is riskier than saving too much.  
-Enrollment in retirement plans is not as high as it should be given the benefits. About 30% of eligible people do not enroll, even for plans with "free money" from employer matches. Some fail to enroll even when contributions and withdrawals have no penalties.  
- In summary, while the standard theory of retirement saving is reasonable in theory, in reality people have a hard time following it and often need nudges and guidance to save adequately for their retirement.

 

- Despite the benefits of employer retirement plans like matching contributions, many eligible employees do not join the plans or do not contribute enough to get the full employer match. 
- To nudge more people to join retirement plans sooner, employers can make enrollment automatic so that employees are enrolled unless they opt out. Studies show automatic enrollment dramatically increases participation rates and the fraction of participants who drop out remains low, suggesting most employees prefer to be in the plan.  
- Requiring employees to make an active choice about joining the plan, rather than having a default of non-enrollment, can also increase participation. Simplifying the enrollment process by providing a pre-selected savings rate and asset allocation that employees can accept by just checking a box also helps.
- While automatic enrollment gets more people in plans, many stick with the default low contribution rate and investment fund, which may be insufficient for retirement. To address this, employers can alter the match formula to nudge people to save more, for example by matching 30% of contributions up to 10% of pay instead of 50% of the first 6% of pay. 
- Education alone does not seem to be very effective in getting people to make better retirement plan decisions. Studies show little improvement in financial literacy and only small increases in participation after educational seminars.
- The Save More Tomorrow program uses choice architecture based on psychological principles to automatically escalate employees' contribution rates over time. This program recognizes that self-control is easier if changes happen in the future, people hate decreases in their paychecks, and people focus on nominal rather than real dollars.

 

Inertia is a powerful force that can either help or hinder saving for retirement. The Save More Tomorrow program taps into inertia by having people commit in advance to increasing their retirement contributions in sync with future pay raises. This means take-home pay never goes down, so people don't see the increased contributions as losses. Once enrolled, the saving increases happen automatically. 

The first Save More Tomorrow program in 1998 had high participation rates of 80-90% and increased average savings rates from around 3-6% to 13.6% over 3.5 years. Key factors for success were:

1) One-on-one meetings with financial consultants who could sign people up on the spot. 
2) Easy enrollment - the easier it is to sign up, the higher the participation.
3) Combining Save More Tomorrow with automatic enrollment is the most effective approach. Some companies have achieved 78% participation this way.

Governments have helped by reducing barriers to and incentivizing these types of programs. The 2006 Pension Protection Act gave employers incentives like waiving annoying regulations if they match employee contributions, automatically enroll employees, and automatically increase contributions over time.

However, governments can also make mistakes, like the Social Security Administration. They only provide a "Break-Even Age" calculator to help people decide when to start claiming benefits. It lacks the ability to factor in key details like life expectancy, spouse's details, future income, and impatience to determine the optimal time for each individual to start claiming.

So in summary, while inertia often hinders saving, programs like Save More Tomorrow show how we can harness inertia and build good choice architecture to help people save for retirement. Governments and companies can support this through incentives, easy enrollment, and providing truly helpful tools for people to make the best choices.

 

The Social Security Administration’s calculator for determining when to start receiving benefits is very basic. It only considers two start dates and doesn’t account for important factors like health, work plans, income, spouse’s age, etc. A better calculator could ask questions to determine these factors and provide sensible default options. Choosing when to start retirement benefits is challenging for humans and would benefit from a well-designed choice architecture.  

Investing for retirement is also challenging and complicated for humans.  They have to determine how much risk to take, which often means choosing an asset allocation of stocks and bonds. Riskier allocations usually mean higher returns but more chance of loss. Determining the right asset allocation and rebalancing periodically is difficult. Humans are prone to two main mistakes:

1. Being overly influenced by short-term fluctuations. E.g. checking investment balances frequently and overly feeling losses, which can lead to investing too little in stocks. 

2. Relying on rules of thumb rather than calculating the precise trade-off between risk and return for their situation.

To illustrate these mistakes, the example compares two investors. Vince frequently checks his investment balance and strongly feels losses, so he is very nervous about investing in stocks. Rip won't check for 20 years, so he is comfortable putting everything in stocks to benefit from their strong long-term returns. The lesson is that less frequent monitoring leads to better investing in stocks. Most investors should invest more in stocks for the long run.

In summary, retirement investing is challenging but important. Choice architecture and understanding human mistakes and tendencies can help improve decisions. Less frequent monitoring of investments may help overcome some biases to enable better long-term investing.

 

- Many investors choose to invest nearly all of their money in stocks. 
- Investors were increasingly investing more in stocks in the 1990s, believing stocks could only go up. 
- However, an analysis of investor behavior shows their market timing was poor. They were buying more stocks when prices were high, and selling when prices were low. 
- Investors often use simple rules of thumb, like splitting money evenly between stocks and bonds. Even experts like Harry Markowitz admitted to using such a basic rule. 
- The "diversification heuristic" or the "1/n heuristic" lead investors to naively diversify by splitting money evenly among options. 
- Studies show the options offered in retirement plans significantly impact investor choices. More stock funds lead to higher allocations to stocks. 
- "Lifestyle" funds that provide pre-diversified portfolios based on risk tolerance can help, but investors often do not fully utilize them and end up with aggressive portfolios without realizing it.
- Many investors end up heavily invested in their company's stock, not properly diversifying. This can lead to major losses if the company struggles.

The key points are that individual investors are prone to poor market timing, overconfidence in stocks, naive diversification, and concentrating investments in familiar companies like their employers. Rules of thumb and the options provided in plans tend to drive behavior more so than prudent portfolio management principles. This can negatively impact investment returns.

 
- Charles Prestwood invested most of his retirement funds in Enron stock because the company encouraged employee stock ownership and he was loyal to Enron. 
- When Enron collapsed, Prestwood lost his entire life savings of $1.3 million in Enron stock. Now he lives on a small pension and Social Security.
- Many employees invest too much of their retirement funds in their company's stock, which is very risky. Company stock is riskier than a diversified portfolio and employees can lose both their jobs and savings if the company struggles.
- Employees don't understand the risks of company stock and think their company's stock is less risky than it really is. They also assume strong past performance of the stock means it will continue to perform well. 
- Having more than 10% of retirement funds in company stock is very risky. Diversifying investments is safer. 
- Laws give company stock preferential treatment in retirement plans, even though it's risky. Treating company stock like other investments could help address this issue.
- "Sell More Tomorrow" plans gradually shift employees' company stock into diversified funds over time. This reduces risk while avoiding signaling that the company stock is a bad investment.
- Using good "choice architecture" and default options in retirement plans can help guide participants to better investing decisions, like diversified portfolio options instead of too much company stock.

The key ideas are that many employees invest too much in their company's stock, putting them at risk. This concentration in company stock is due in part to preferential treatment under laws and encouragement from the company. Using choice architecture to encourage diversification and offer better default options can help address this issue and protect employees' savings.

 

- Mortgage shopping has become much more complicated with many options like fixed-rate, variable-rate, interest-only, and teaser rate mortgages. This makes it hard for people to choose the best option for them. 

- Studies show that disadvantaged borrowers like minorities, the less educated, and those who use mortgage brokers pay hundreds to over a thousand dollars more for their mortgages, even controlling for risk.

- The mortgage market has become very complicated, putting unsophisticated borrowers at a disadvantage. They are more likely to get bad advice from people like mortgage brokers who seem to be helping them. Mortgage brokers who deal with rich clients have more incentive to give fair advice. Those dealing with the poor just want to make money quickly.

- Views on subprime loans are extreme. Some call them all predatory, but higher-risk loans legitimately have higher rates. At the same time, some subprime lenders do prey on the disadvantaged with deceptive practices. Regulation is needed to prevent deception and ensure transparency. 

- More options and complexity help sophisticated borrowers but hurt the disadvantaged, who struggle to evaluate options and are more vulnerable to bad advice and deception. Regulations promoting transparency and preventing predatory practices can help. Defaults also need to be discouraged. Choice architecture could make the best options more salient and help people see the total long-term costs of different mortgages.

In summary, the mortgage market's increasing complexity and options help some but disadvantage others. Regulations, nudges, and better choice architecture could provide significant benefits, especially for the disadvantaged.

 

- Microfinance loans provide credit to poor people in developing countries who otherwise would not have access to loans. While the interest rates are very high, often over 200%, the borrowers benefit greatly from these loans. 

- Subprime lending, like for mortgages, is controversial. On the one hand, it provides credit to high-risk borrowers who would otherwise be denied. This allows some to become homeowners or business owners. However, subprime loans often involve predatory practices that take advantage of unsophisticated borrowers. Brokers push risky, confusing loan terms with high fees and interest rates. Borrowers struggle to understand all the paperwork and end up with bad deals.

- Reforms are needed to improve the choice architecture for subprime borrowers. Simply banning “predatory” loans is too blunt and risks cutting off credit to deserving borrowers. Instead, the proposal is to require simplified disclosures that clearly show total fees and interest payments over time. This would make it easier for borrowers to compare offers and shop around. Providing detailed data in a machine-readable format could also allow third parties to offer comparison services and advice. 

- For mortgages, limiting the types of allowed loans and requiring estimates to be valid for 30 days could help. But a better approach is to require lenders to provide simplified “recap” reports showing total fees and interest charges, as well as possible worst-case scenarios for variable rates. This information would facilitate shopping around and the emergence of third-party comparison services. Evidence shows borrowers get the best deals when total upfront fees are low or zero, so recap reports could significantly benefit consumers.

- Student loans also involve complications like variable rates and lots of fine print. Simplified disclosures and recap reports could provide significant benefits to student borrowers and their families. Making the market more transparent and competitive may help address rising college costs in the long run.

In summary, improving the choice architecture through simplified and standardized disclosures can benefit subprime borrowers, especially when it also facilitates a more competitive and transparent market. This approach may be better than outright bans while still protecting consumers from predatory practices.

 

- There are two types of student loans: federal government loans and private loans from financial institutions. Federal loans are need-based, subsidized and have government guarantees. Private lenders find these loans highly profitable. 

- Student loan borrowing faces similar issues as subprime mortgages. Misleading solicitations, complicated applications and lack of understanding lead students and families to take on too much debt. Some colleges and lenders have engaged in unethical practices to push students toward particular private lenders.

- The government’s policy of subsidizing and guaranteeing federal student loans while relying on private lenders for distribution has led to “rent-seeking” behavior and excessive profits in the private student loan industry. 

- Policy recommendations include simplifying financial aid applications, improving transparency in comparing loan options, incentivizing college savings and limiting private lender incentives.

- Credit cards provide a convenient mode of payment and source of liquidity but can lead to overspending and debt problems due to lack of self-control and high interest rates. Average household credit card debt in the U.S. is substantial.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

1) Sweden launched a privatized social security system that gave citizens a lot of choice in how they invested their funds. The system had over 450 funds people could choose from and encouraged people to actively choose their own portfolios.

2) The system had a default fund for those who did not choose their own portfolio. The designers had to decide whether to encourage people to choose the default, discourage them from choosing it, or remain neutral.

3) Eliminating choice by only offering the default fund (Option A) goes against libertarian paternalism. Forcing people to choose a fund (Option E) would inevitably lead some people to forfeit their contributions since some would fail to choose.

4) Options B (discourage default), C (encourage default), and D (neutral) were possibilities. It's difficult to actually be neutral since how the default is described will impact whether people choose it.

5) The key takeaway is that maximizing choice does not necessarily lead to the best outcomes. The Swedish system likely resulted in some people choosing poor portfolios due to the large number of complex choices and encouragement of active choosing. A better choice architecture with smarter default options and less encouragement of overly complex active choosing may have led to better outcomes.

The key lessons from the Swedish experience are:

1) Choice alone does not guarantee good outcomes. Too much complex choice can lead to poor decisions.

2) Default options and how they are framed and described significantly impact outcomes. Default options should be carefully selected and "neutrality" is difficult to achieve.

3) Governments and choice architects must consider human tendencies towards inertia and status quo bias. Maximizing active choosing is not always optimal. Simpler choice with good defaults is often better.

4) Choice architecture matters for privatized social security systems. Good design can help citizens make better choices and have better outcomes. Poor design can lead to poor choices and poor outcomes.

 The key points in the summary are:

1. Two-thirds of the participants actively chose their own investment portfolios instead of accepting the default fund. The percentage of active choosers has declined over time to only 8% for new participants joining recently, likely due to less government encouragement and advertising. 

2. The default fund appears to have been well designed, with a prudent mix of stocks and bonds, low fees, and good performance. In contrast, the aggregate portfolio of active choosers had a higher allocation to risky stocks, much more concentrated in Swedish companies, higher fees, and worse performance.

3. The launch of the privatization program coincided with the peak of the stock market bubble, likely influencing many participants to choose riskier, stock-heavy portfolios. Had the launch occurred a couple years later, portfolios likely would have been more balanced.

4. While we can't know participants' personal financial situations and needs, based on typical investment principles the default fund seems to have offered a more sensible choice for most investors. The aggregate portfolio of active choosers exhibited behaviors like trend following, overconfidence in local companies, and willingness to pay higher fees that often lead to worse outcomes.

5. The large market share attracted to the default fund, despite efforts to encourage active choosing, suggests many participants were content with a simple, low-cost, professionally designed option. The declining rate of active choosing over time also points to the appeal of the default for new participants.

In summary, while offering active choice and control is appealing in theory, the outcomes of this privatization program suggest most participants lacked the knowledge and discipline to make optimal investment decisions on their own. The default fund attracted a large market share by offering an easy, attractively-designed option for investors seeking simplicity over active control.

 

- The Swedish government implemented a privatized social security system with many fund options for individuals to choose from.

- The fund that attracted the largest share of investments was a technology fund that had very high returns in the 5 years leading up to the program launch. However, it lost a large portion of its value shortly after. 

- The timing of when the program launched had a big impact on people's fund choices because they were swayed by recent high returns and invested heavily in funds that had been recently successful.

- The government encouraged participants to choose their own portfolios but few people made changes to their portfolios after initially choosing. This shows that people have a tendency to stick with the status quo.

- Advertising by the funds focused more on flashy messages and past returns rather than helpful information for investors. The advertising influenced people to choose funds with higher fees and risk.

- The Swedish experience shows that when governments offer people many complex choices, they need to provide guidance and recommendations to help them choose. A better designed system would have encouraged the default fund option and guided people towards a simplified set of choices.

- If the US were to implement a similar social security privatization, the Swedish experience provides many useful lessons. A good system would focus on a good default fund, guide people through simple choices, and only provide many options for those who want them. 

- The more choices provided, the more help and guidance people need. Failure to learn this lesson led to problems in the design of the US Medicare Prescription Drug program.

 Here is a summary of the passage:

- Medicare Part D is a prescription drug benefit plan for seniors created during the Bush administration. It aimed to give seniors choices among many private plans and let the free market operate. 

- However, Part D suffered from four major defects:

1. It provided little guidance to help seniors choose the best plans.
2. Its default for most seniors was nonenrollment. 
3. It chose defaults at random for some who were automatically enrolled. 
4. It failed to serve the most vulnerable like the poor and less educated.

- Part D offered a menu of many choices but made it hard to choose well. It had complex rules, like coverage gaps and penalties.

- Many seniors found Part D confusing and overwhelming. Doctors and pharmacists were also confused. It was difficult for people to determine the best plan for their needs.

- While Part D improved coverage, its poor choice architecture and complexity caused problems. With better design, it could have worked much better.

The key points are that Part D aimed to give choice and harness market forces but ended up creating confusion due to its complexity, lack of good defaults, and failure to properly guide decision making. With a better understanding of how people actually choose, it could have achieved its goals far more successfully.

 

- President Bush acknowledged that the Medicare Part D program, with its forty-six plan choices, would initially confuse and frustrate many seniors. However, he argued that the options and assistance from private groups would ultimately benefit participants.  

- Enrollment in Part D plans was high, in part because many seniors were auto-enrolled through employer or other coverage. However, many vulnerable seniors—especially those dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid—did not actively choose a plan and were assigned to random default plans.

- These random plan assignments likely impaired the health of some participants who were placed in plans not well-suited to their needs. Surveys found that while some reported improved access, over 20% said they had stopped taking medications due to issues with their plan.

- The government claimed that people’s drug needs change too much to allow “intelligent assignment” based on past use. However, for seniors on long-term medications, past use is predictive. Random assignment seems “callous and irresponsible.”

- In summary, while Part D led to greater coverage, its confusing array of choices and random default assignments—especially for the most vulnerable—undermined its success and philosophy. Simplification and more customized defaults could have improved outcomes.

 Here is a summary of insurance plans:

- There are many dimensions to compare plans like premiums, deductibles, copays, covered drugs, pharmacy networks, prior authorization, quantity limits, etc. This makes choosing a plan very difficult and time-consuming. 

- Most seniors rely on passive information from mailers or call centers to choose a plan. The Medicare website is difficult to navigate and gives different cost estimates and recommendations to different users. 

- Frequent changes in drug prices mean that the cheapest plan today may not be the cheapest tomorrow. This adds to the confusion.

- Studies show that even when presented with simplified choices, many seniors fail to choose a plan that minimizes their out-of-pocket costs. They struggle to connect their needs and risk preferences to the available plans.

- Possible nudges include:

1. Provide personalized plan recommendations based on an individual’s conditions, prescriptions, and risk tolerance. This could help people choose plans better suited to them.

2. Send reminders about the open enrollment period and provide information on how to review one’s plan choice. This may prompt more people to actively choose a plan each year.

3. Require insurers to keep premiums and drug prices stable for an enrollment year. This adds predictability and allows people to choose plans based on their needs rather than chasing lower prices.

4. Offer a “smart default” plan for those who don’t choose. The default plan could be based on an individual’s known conditions and prescriptions. People would still be free to opt out of the default and choose another plan.

5. Increase transparency about prior authorization, quantity limits, and other restrictions for each plan. This information may be hard to obtain currently but is important for choosing a suitable plan.

6. Provide coaching and education to help people evaluate how well their current plan is meeting their needs. This could encourage more optimal plan switching.

In summary, well-designed nudges can help prompt better health insurance choices while preserving freedom of choice. But more transparency and a simplified, user-friendly experience are also needed.

 

- Kidneys and other organs for transplants are in high demand but short supply. Many people die while waiting for organs.

- Most organ donors are people declared brain dead but kept on life support. In the US, there are 12,000-15,000 potential donors per year but fewer than half become actual donors.

- Getting consent from surviving family members is the major obstacle to increasing donations. Better choice architecture, like improved default rules and simplifying the donation process, could help increase the organ supply and save thousands of lives.

- For example, switching to an opt-out system where people are donors by default unless they opt out could help. Right now, people have to opt in to become donors. An opt-out system could take advantage of people's inertia and lead to higher donation rates, as seen in other countries. 

- Also, simplifying the donation process by using a single-question prompt on donor cards and licenses, and training hospital staff on how to effectively request donations could help. The way choices are framed and how requests are made has a huge impact.

- In summary, small low-cost changes to choice architecture appear able to substantially increase the organ supply and save many lives at little cost. This is an excellent example of using choice architecture for good.

 

There are several approaches that could increase the supply of organs available for transplant and save lives:

1. Explicit consent: This requires people to take action to register as organ donors. However, many willing donors fail to register due to inertia and hassle factors. Studies show a gap between people's stated willingness to donate and actually registering.

2. Routine removal: This allows the state to remove organs from deceased people or those in hopeless conditions without asking for consent. This could increase supply dramatically but violates widely accepted principles about individual choice regarding one's own body.

3. Presumed consent: This makes everyone a presumed organ donor unless they opt out. This policy preserves choice but changes the default. Studies show presumed consent can increase consent rates enormously compared to explicit consent. However, its effectiveness depends on having an infrastructure to match donors and recipients.

4. Mandated choice: This requires people to choose whether or not to be an organ donor, for example when renewing a driver's license. This also aims to address inertia but forces people to make an active choice. Evidence suggests giving an "unsure" option may reduce its effectiveness.  

In summary, changing the default rule to presumed consent and implementing mandated choice policies could significantly boost organ supply and save lives while still respecting personal choice. However, success depends on a well-developed organ donation and transplant infrastructure.

 

- Governments have taken many actions to protect the environment, like reducing pollution and protecting endangered species. Many of these actions have been successful but some have been costly, inefficient, and even counterproductive.

- Traditionally, governments have relied on "command-and-control" regulation, where they dictate behavior and technology choices. This is inefficient and restricts choice. 

- It would be better to use choice architecture, like incentives and feedback, to encourage environmentally-friendly behavior while preserving freedom of choice.

- Two problems contribute to environmental harm: (1) lack of proper incentives, like polluters not paying the full costs of pollution; and (2) lack of feedback, like people not realizing the environmental impact of their actions.

- To fix incentive problems, governments can use taxes, penalties, cap-and-trade systems, and other market mechanisms. These are more efficient and freedom-preserving than command-and-control regulation.

- In summary, choice architecture and incentive-based policies can help solve environmental problems in a less costly, more libertarian way than strict government mandates. Giving people information and proper incentives is better than restricting their choices.

 

- The authors acknowledge that proposals to use economic incentives like taxes or cap-and-trade systems to address environmental problems are not new. However, they argue that these approaches should not be rejected just because most economists agree with them. 

- The authors believe these incentive-based approaches are compatible with libertarian paternalism. They give people choice and flexibility compared to rigid command-and-control regulations. Companies also generally prefer these approaches because they impose lower costs.

- The authors argue that pricing pollution through taxes or cap-and-trade systems is often the best approach. These systems make the costs of environmental protection transparent, though they can be politically difficult to implement. The revenues from these systems could be used to offset other costs or fund other programs to make them more palatable.

- As an example, the U.S. acid rain cap-and-trade program has been very successful, dramatically reducing costs compared to a command-and-control approach. The program’s benefits have far outweighed its costs. The authors hope similar approaches will be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

- While getting prices right is most important, the authors suggest some “nudge-like” steps as interim measures or to complement pricing. Specifically, they recommend improving feedback to consumers through better information and disclosure. Examples include warning labels, product disclosures, workplace hazard communications, and environmental impact statements. Disclosure can motivate both markets and politics. 

- One successful example of environmental disclosure is the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act. Though originally just a bookkeeping measure, it has spurred substantial reductions in toxic releases as companies worked to avoid public backlash from the disclosures.

 

The Toxic Release Inventory requires companies to disclose the chemicals they release into the environment. This disclosure requirement has been very successful in reducing toxic emissions. Companies want to avoid appearing on the “environmental blacklist” of the worst polluters, so they take steps to reduce emissions to avoid bad publicity and other costs. 

A similar Greenhouse Gas Inventory requiring disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions could nudge companies to reduce emissions by using social pressure and concern over bad publicity. Other disclosure requirements, like fuel economy stickers for cars showing estimated annual fuel costs, can also promote competition to be more environmentally friendly.

More ambitious nudges could make energy use more visible to consumers to encourage conservation, like devices that show how much energy is being used or tools to share that information publicly. Voluntary programs where government works with companies to adopt more efficient and environmentally friendly practices, like the EPA’s Green Lights and Energy Star programs, can also nudge better behavior without mandates.

The key insight is that disclosure and making the costs and impacts of behavior more salient can motivate change, even without requirements or bans. Nudges that harness social incentives and competitive pressures have been shown effective in promoting environmental goals.

 

- There is consensus that children have a right to good education, but disagreement on how to achieve that. School choice is a polarizing issue. 

- Libertarians and Milton Friedman support school choice and competition which can improve education, especially for disadvantaged students. However, in practice more choice does not always lead to the best outcomes. 

- Evidence suggests school choice programs can improve student performance, especially for younger, lower-income and minority students. Performance can improve 1-7% per year.

- However, many parents do not utilize school choice options and those that do often make poor choices. Plans are needed to help parents make better choices.

- The Worcester, MA case shows that even when more choice is offered, discouragement and an arduous process can prevent parents from exercising that choice. Officials stressed limitations, unattractive parts of the program and tried to highlight improvements to deter parents. The choice process was tedious with many steps. Information was controlled, limiting access for tutoring and test prep companies.

- In summary, while school choice can benefit students, especially disadvantaged ones, programs must be designed to actually facilitate good choices by parents. Merely offering more options is not enough. Plans should make the choice process easy to navigate, provide good information and enable access for support services. With well-designed programs, school choice can fulfill the goal of providing children a right to a good education.

 

- Parents often lack information about school choices and stick with default options. Researchers in Charlotte, NC gave parents simplified information about school test scores and acceptance rates. With this information, parents chose schools with 70% higher test scores on average. Students who got into higher-performing schools had better outcomes. 

- The Boston controlled-choice system for assigning students to schools led to unintended "gaming" by parents. Savvy parents learned to manipulate their rankings to increase their chances of getting into top schools. Less savvy parents were disadvantaged. Boston eventually adopted a revised system designed by economists that was strategy-proof.

- In San Marcos, TX, the school superintendent required students to apply to the local community college to graduate high school. With help from teachers and college staff, students received information about the financial benefits of college and help applying. College enrollment from San Marcos High rose from 35-60%. This simple nudge was very effective at boosting college attainment for a low-income, Latino student population.

- The key lessons are:
1) Simplifying information for parents and students can help them make much better school choices. 
2) Choice systems should be designed to avoid unintended strategic behavior and not disadvantage less sophisticated participants. 
3) Small changes and nudges, even without major resources, can be very effective at improving outcomes.

 

Consultants offer weekend sessions to help parents guide their children through the college application process. The sessions include guidance on choosing colleges to apply to, completing application forms, writing personal essays, and applying for financial aid and scholarships. The goal is to increase the likelihood that students will attend college by helping their parents support and encourage them during the application process.

 

- Doctors generally do not face major financial consequences from malpractice lawsuits. Malpractice premiums are fixed and do not increase with the number of lawsuits. While doctors want to avoid lawsuits for reputational reasons, the financial risk is low. 

- The malpractice system does a poor job of deterring medical negligence. Most patients who suffer from negligence do not sue. Many lawsuits that result in payouts to plaintiffs did not actually involve negligence. There is little evidence the system significantly deters poor medical care.

- The malpractice system requires patients to essentially buy “lottery tickets” that may result in a large payout but usually result in nothing. This is an inefficient use of resources. 

- The authors propose allowing patients to waive their right to sue for negligence in exchange for lower medical costs. This could benefit both doctors and patients. Patients could choose plans with or without the right to sue. If waiving the right to sue was the default, most would likely do so.

- An even more ambitious proposal is to only allow lawsuits for intentional or reckless harm, not mere negligence. Patients could then choose to “buy” broader liability coverage if they want. This could reduce healthcare costs. 

- Other options include capping noneconomic damages, using an administrative no-fault system, or fully privatizing marriage by eliminating government-sanctioned marriage.

- The overall goal is to increase freedom of contract in medical care and lower costs. Even small improvements could help address the healthcare crisis. Privatizing marriage is one way to balance religious freedom and individual liberty.

 The key arguments in the passage are:

1) Marriage should be privatized by eliminating state-issued marriage licenses. Instead, the government should only offer civil unions, which provide legal rights and benefits to couples. Religious and private organizations would perform marriage ceremonies. 

2) Privatizing marriage would protect religious freedom while providing legal rights to couples. Religious groups could set their own rules for marriage and the state would not endorse any particular relationships.

3) State control of marriage is outdated. Originally, marriage licenses were meant to regulate sexuality and child-rearing, but now people have rights to sex and parenthood outside of marriage. Marriage was also meant to make it hard for couples to divorce, but now divorce is more accepted.

4) Private organizations and couples could design marriages that suit their needs. Different groups could have different rules for marriage based on their values and beliefs. Couples would have more choice in the type of marriage they want.

5) Legal rights and benefits for couples could still be provided through civil unions regulated by the state. So couples would not lose legal protections and entitlements. But the state would not officially recognize marriages.

So in summary, the key proposal is that state-recognized marriage should be abolished and replaced with private marriages and state civil unions. This would increase freedom and choice while still providing legal protections for couples. But the government would not favor or endorse any particular type of relationship.

 

- Marriage used to be more permanent, but now exit from marriage is relatively easy and common. Very few people choose “covenant marriage” even when it is available. This shows that most people prefer the flexibility of noncovenant marriage.

- Official marriage licenses create an unrealistic dichotomy between “married” and “single.”  In reality, there are many variations of relationships. It would be better to allow people to structure relationships as they choose.

- The concerns that official marriage protects children and more vulnerable partners can be addressed through other means, like direct support requirements or carefully designed default rules upon dissolution of a relationship. Official marriage is not necessary or sufficient for this.

- Official marriage is not very libertarian. While no one is forced to marry, the state creates a monopoly on the legal form of marriage, limits who can marry, and provides benefits only through that form. It would be better to rely on civil unions and private institutions. 

- The benefits of official marriage are low, while the costs are not huge but include unnecessary polarization and confusion. It would be better for marriage to be a private matter, not a state matter. 

- Rather than debating the nature of official marriage, we should focus on choosing appropriate default rules and nudges for people making long-term commitments, whether through marriage, civil unions, or private means. The goal should be to clarify rights and obligations and protect the vulnerable, especially partners and children. Default rules should usually reflect the explicit or likely implicit promises people have made to each other.

So in summary, the key arguments are: (1) official marriage is not necessary and has some downsides; (2) long-term relationships should be a private matter, not a state matter; but (3) good default rules and choice architecture are still needed to support people in those relationships and protect the vulnerable. The overall stance is one of libertarian paternalism toward relationship commitment and dissolution.

take a second to paste it into a website that scores the
message for positive and negative language, then provides a
“civility check.” Some words, like please, thanks, and
congratulations, increase the score; others, like idiot,
stupid, and hate decrease it. If your email gets a low score,
reword it to be more constructive before sending. A nudge
as simple as a few seconds of feedback could help reduce
hostile communication, foster goodwill, and make
interac-tions more productive. The technology to provide
such feedback already exists.
6. The Forgetting Tax: Memory is malleable, and nostalgists
are prone to rosy retrospection. When something is gone,
we tend to forget its annoying qualities and remember only
the good. This can make it easy to romanticize lost
pleasures (old toys, the multipurpose station wagon) or
past relationships. But while memory’s shortcuts often
serve us well, they can also lead us astray.
What if you had to pay a small “forgetting tax” when
disposing of an item or relationship? If, say, you had to pay
5 percent of an item’s value when throwing it away or
selling it at a yard sale, or 1 percent of the total time
invested in an ended relationship, that fee might encourage
slightly more realistic assessments. Having to pause and
assign a monetary value could trigger a more balanced
accounting of pros and cons, blunting nostalgia’s rosy
revisionism. Not a serious policy proposal, we admit—just a
nudge to counter the effects of a behavioral bias. Money,
after all, is memory’s nemesis: what we pay for we
remember.
7. The Identity Verifier: In many situations our assumptions
about people depend heavily on superficial cues.
232
EXTENSIONS AND OBJECTIONS
Appearance, ethnicity, gender, and age often shape how we
expect individuals to behave or what we perceive them to be
capable of. These biases are hard to avoid but performancebased assessments can help.
Consider an online Identity Verifier that allows individuals
to demonstrate actual abilities and skills through a series of
web-based tests. Job applicants could choose what
competencies and traits to have verified according to a
particular position. Standardized scores for qualities like
critical thinking, communication, creativity, and diligence
would then be issued. While imperfect, a system based on
relevant performance measures rather than perceptions
could help reduce bias in hiring and
advancement. Anonymous verifications may even help in
reducing discrimination.
Of course, any assessment opens the door to gaming
strategies, and some qualities like judgment involve subtlety
beyond the reach of simple tests. Yet nudging hiring and
promotions slightly closer to merit-based decisions could
yield benefits to both individuals and organizations. For an
approach so reliant on technology, the idea of an Identity
Verifier may prove surprisingly humanizing.
8. The Fruit Bowl Rewards Card: Most customer rewards
programs dispense benefits that promote overconsumption
rather than health or sustainability. Airline miles, for
example, subsidize discretionary travel. What if rewards
reflected wellness and social goals instead?
A produce market, for instance, could offer a Fruit Bowl
Rewards Card. Each purchase of $10 or more earns credits
toward free produce or fruit baskets for local charities like
food banks, shelters, or schools. Customers win points for
fruit and vegetable selections, bonus points for organic or
locally sourced items. Points could also be redeemed for
Information on nutrition or recipes. This nudges individuals
toward better health choices while also tangibly serving
community needs. A win-win rewards realignment.
9. The Happiness Dashboard: Self-help books tout the
benefits of gratitude journals, acts of kindness, exercise,
social interaction, and mindfulness—all of which science
suggests contribute to well-being. But who has time for
them all? A streamlined solution could be an integrated
Happiness Dashboard that nudges users
A DOZEN NUDGES
233
toward a balanced portfolio of happiness-enhancing
behaviors.
On your mobile device or computer, the dashboard would
track things like: the number of gratitude entries recorded,
friendly greetings offered (hold doors, smile, make eye
contact), minutes of exercise logged, good deeds registered,
relaxation breathing time recorded, meetups scheduled with
friends or family. You choose which factors to monitor and
target levels for each, and the app provides reminders and
motivation to help you achieve them, with points and
badges offered as rewards. By synthesizing research into an
easy-to-use interface focused on concrete actions, a
Happiness Dashboard could make well-being less
nebulous and more achievable. Joy, after all, is a habit.
10. The 10-Minute Tidy Challenge: Given conflicting

commitments and constant distraction, most people have
difficulty finding time to straighten and organize their
living or work spaces. But disorder and clutter sap
cognitive resources and undermine productivity. A 10Minute Tidy Challenge could help.
Here’s how it works: Users receive a daily text message
prompting them to spend just 10 minutes organizing and
tidying a selected area of their home or office. Each area is
featured for one day every week. The message includes
links to helpful ideas for streamlining that space. Those who
meet the 10-minute tidy challenge get an encouraging
message and can opt to receive an accountability partner
for extra motivation.
Focusing people’s attention for a short, achievable period is
a tiny intervention that cumulatively adds up to greater
order and efficiency. Starting is often the hardest part, so
specific, time-limited nudges help bypass inertia and make
progress possible. If you can tidy up for 10 minutes a day,
everything in its place is within reach.
11. The Nightly News Nudge: Exposure to frequent coverage
of natural disasters, violent crime, or human conflict
can breed anxiety and fuel a sense that danger lurks
around every corner. Of course, commercially driven
media have incentives to focus on sensational and

uncertain stories—but journalists also have a responsibility
to report events accurately and
234
EXTENSIONS AND OBJECTIONS
objectively. One small remedy for news-induced stress
that journalists could adopt is a Nightly News Nudge:
ending broadcasts with a short, balanced report on any
measurable social or environmental improvements from that
day.
Focusing briefly on society’s forward strides, scientific or
technological advancements, recovering endangered species,
literacy campaign victories, acts of human decency—anything
substantive and optimistic—could help neutralize negativity bias
without compromising journalistic integrity. Anchors might say
something like, “And finally, signs of progress . . . ” before
sharing one inspiring success story. This nudge toward more
constructive coverage is a reminder that it’s not all doom and
gloom— there are daily causes for hope if we care to notice
them. Ending on an up-tick.
12. The Senior Sophomore: Many colleges struggle with
retention and graduation rates, especially for students from
disadvantaged backgrounds. Transitioning from high school
to more demanding university coursework proves difficult
for some, and without a strong support system, many
talented individuals become discouraged and drop out.
Enter the Senior Sophomore—an upperclassman, ideally
from a similar demographic, assigned to mentor a
sophomore through weekly check-ins, guidance, and
encouragement. The Senior Sophomore has walked the
same path and overcome the same obstacles, so they’re
uniquely equipped

 

1. The current U.S. income tax system is very complex. An automatic tax return where the IRS provides taxpayers with a pre-filled return can simplify the process and reduce costs. 

2. websites like Stickk.com allow people to make commitments to achieve their goals by putting money at stake. If people fail, the money goes to charity. This approach has been shown to be effective in helping people achieve goals like losing weight or quitting smoking.

3. The CARES program in the Philippines helps smokers quit by having them deposit the money they would have spent on cigarettes into a bank account. If they pass a urine test showing they have quit after 6 months, they get the money back. This program has been very successful.

4. Requiring motorcycle riders who don't want to wear helmets to take a special driving course and show proof of health insurance is a less intrusive way to promote safety than an outright ban on helmetless riding. 

5. Allowing gambling addicts to put themselves on a list banning them from casinos and collecting winnings is an innovative way to help them control their addiction. 

6. The Destiny Health Plan gives people incentives like "Vitality Bucks" for exercising, going to the doctor, and other healthy behaviors. This approach combines health insurance with nudges to encourage healthy lifestyles.

7. The "dollar a day" program pays teenage mothers $1 per day for each day they are not pregnant. This small incentive has been shown to be effective in reducing repeat teen pregnancies. 

8. Putting a red light on central air conditioning systems to notify people when they need to change the filter is an easy nudge that can prevent system failures and high repair costs.

In summary, these examples show innovative ways to use small incentives, reminders,  commitment devices and choice architecture to help people achieve life goals, improve health, and simplify everyday processes. The key is designing nudges that are non-intrusive but effective in guiding people's behavior.

 

- No-bite nail polish and Disulfiram are products that make indulging in bad habits unpleasant to help people change those habits. They work by having the Reflective System discipline the Automatic System.

- The Civility Check proposal suggests detecting angry emails and cautioning the sender before sending, to promote more civility. A stronger version could prevent sending for 24 hours.  Though waiting for technology, the authors have adopted manually sending angry emails to each other to edit.

- Objections to nudges include:

1) The slippery slope argument - that even modest nudges will lead down a slope to unwanted government overreach and coercion.  However, nudges can be evaluated on their own merits, opt-out rights reduce slipperiness, and some choice architecture is inevitable. Government non-intervention is unrealistic. 

2) Evil nudgers and bad nudges - Choice architects, whether companies or governments, may have incentives to nudge for their own benefit, not the individual's. However, disclosure and transparency can help address this, as can democratic checks on government nudging. Competition in the private sector also provides some check.

3) Government incompetence - The argument that government lacks the knowledge and expertise to nudge well.  However, governments have successfully nudged in areas like environmental protection and public health. Governments also have more knowledge and expertise than often assumed.  Government nudges can also be flexible and responsive.

4) Individual sovereignty - The argument that nudging infringes on individual freedom of choice and autonomy.  However, the liberty to choose is constrained and influenced by choice architecture regardless.  As long as opt-out rights are provided, individual sovereignty is preserved with libertarian paternalism. 

In summary, while objections to nudging exist, there are also counterarguments to them.  With transparency, disclosure, limits on coercion, and preservation of choice, libertarian paternalism can provide benefits while respecting individual autonomy.

 

- Real architects and public choice architects can both have conflicts of interest, so we need to align incentives and increase transparency for both. We shouldn’t assume public architects are always more dangerous. 

- The invisible hand works best for simple, frequently purchased products. For complex products like mortgages, the market may fail and people can get exploited before realizing.

- We should worry about all choice architects, public and private. We need rules to reduce abuses, promote competition, limit interest groups, and encourage the public good. Transparency is key.

- People have a right to make their own choices, so opt-out rights are important. But for some groups like the poor, nudges can help without doing much harm. Learning from mistakes has limits.

- Some critics oppose any forced exchanges or redistribution. But nudges typically have small costs for those unaffected while helping those in need. Most people likely want to help others, and “relative losers” deserve little sympathy.

- The most libertarian critics prefer required choosing over nudges to maximize liberty. But for complex choices with many options, required choosing may not lead to the best outcomes. Nudges can help without eliminating choice.

- In summary, while choice and liberty matter, nudges and modest redistribution can benefit society and help the disadvantaged without unduly restricting freedom or harming others. But we must be vigilant about the incentives and interests of the choice architects.

 

- Forcing people to choose is not always wise or possible. Remaining completely neutral is often impossible.

- The “publicity principle” suggests that any nudging policy should be transparent and defendable to the public. Subliminal advertising violates this principle and should be avoided. But some manipulative policies like vivid anti-drug ads can satisfy the publicity principle if done openly.

- Neutrality is sometimes important, like with voting. But for most policies, pure neutrality is impossible, and some helpful nudging is acceptable if transparent and aimed at benefiting people. 

- The evaluation of any nudge depends on its effects and whether it helps or harms. While some nudges are optional, choice architecture itself is inevitable. Education campaigns are optional nudges that depend on whether the “Nudger” can really help the “Nudgee.”

- In sum, nudging should be done carefully and transparently, with an aim to benefit people and respect their autonomy. But some nudging is often necessary and even helpful. The key is balancing neutrality and paternalism.

 

The potential for beneficial nudging depends on:

1. The Nudgers having expertise and ability to guess what is best for the Nudgees. Nudging makes more sense when choices are complex and Nudgers have expertise. 

2. Either small differences in individual preferences or the ability to detect preferences. Nudging is good when most people prefer the same thing or differences can be observed.

3. Low risks of self-dealing and incompetence by the Nudgers. We must worry about Nudgers acting in self-interest or making mistakes.

Some argue we should go beyond libertarian paternalism to mandatory rules when people's lives would improve. However, we define libertarian paternalism as actions people can easily avoid by opting out, like "one-click" paternalism.

The "asymmetric paternalism" approach proposes helping the least sophisticated while imposing the smallest costs on the most sophisticated. It justifies regulations like:

1. Requiring timers on sunlamps to prevent overuse, if the costs are low and risks of harm are high. 

2. Imposing "cooling-off periods" for some purchases where emotions run high and decisions are infrequent, like door-to-door sales. The costs are often low while the benefits of avoiding regret are high.

3. Mandatory waiting periods for big life decisions like divorce. This ensures time for reflection on important infrequent choices where emotions are strong.

While some regulations like occupational safety laws are non-libertarian, they can be defended based on human errors and fallibilities. However, we resist going too far down the paternalistic path, wanting to stop at "small" costs and preserve freedom of choice. The specific stopping point is hard to define but we aim for the "lightest touch" compatible with welfare.

 

The authors argue that there is a "third way" between heavy-handed government mandates and unregulated free markets. This third way is libertarian paternalism, in which choice architects nudge people in directions that will improve their lives while still preserving freedom of choice. 

The authors make two main claims:

1) Small features of social situations can have huge impacts on behavior. Choice architecture is unavoidable and greatly influences our decisions.

2) Libertarian paternalism is not oxymoronic. Choice architects can nudge people while still preserving freedom of choice.

The authors explore many examples of libertarian paternalism, including:

- Save More Tomorrow: A plan that increases employees' retirement contributions over time. This nudge exploits inertia and loss aversion to help people save more. 

- Following the herd: People have a tendency to follow social norms, often without realizing it. Libertarian paternalism can set good social norms and encourage people to follow them.

- Choice architecture: Seemingly irrelevant details, like default options and ordering effects, can significantly impact choice and behavior. Choice architects should design situations to benefit people.

The authors argue that libertarian paternalism could serve as a "real third way" between rigid government mandates and laissez-faire policymaking. Their approach could help make progress on issues where democrats and republicans traditionally disagree. Overall, the book makes a case for designing situations and policies that gently nudge people toward better choices while preserving freedom of choice.

 

The author proposes that 401(k) plans should automatically enroll eligible employees at a 3 percent contribution rate, matching the first 1 percent at 100 percent, the next 3 percent at 50 percent, for a total match of 3.5 percent if the employee contributes 6 percent. This combination of automatic enrollment and match incentives is designed to attract lower-income employees and pass nondiscrimination testing. 

While critics may argue with some details, the overall policy is an example of libertarian paternalism or "nudging." It does not mandate any employer action but provides incentives for them to make automatic enrollment the default. This policy helps employees save for retirement while maintaining freedom of choice.

 Here are summaries of the sources:

George A., Janet L. Yellen, and Michael L. Katz analyze trends in out-of-wedlock childbearing in the U.S.  They find that socioeconomic factors and welfare policy explain little of the increase.  Rather, it mainly reflects declining social stigma and increased female autonomy.

Alkahami and Slovic show that people's perceptions of the risk and benefit of an activity are inversely related.  As perceived benefit increases, perceived risk decreases, and vice versa.  This relationship holds even for experts and across many domains. 

Allais presents a critique of expected utility theory and argues that people do not make choices that maximize expected utility.  He shows that people's choices in risky or uncertain situations often violate the independence axiom of expected utility theory.

Ameriks and Zeldes find that as people age, they tend to hold a larger share of safe assets, like Treasury bills, and a smaller share of risky assets, like stocks.  However, there is significant heterogeneity in how people's portfolio allocations change with age.

Asch finds that people's opinions can be swayed by hearing the unanimous opinions of others, even when those opinions are clearly incorrect.  People have a strong drive to conform and gain the approval of others.

Ayres and Gertner show how "gap-filling" default rules in contracts can be used strategically by parties seeking to gain advantage.  The default terms that fill in missing provisions in incomplete contracts have important consequences because of parties' tendencies to stick with default options.

Ayres and Nalebuff argue that policymakers and businesses should require more "skin in the game" by forcing people and institutions to bear more risk and responsibility for their actions.  Requiring skin in the game can help fix principal-agent problems and lead to better outcomes.

Badger et al. show that drug addicts are willing to pay more and travel farther to obtain drugs when they are in a state of strong craving.  This suggests that craving for drugs affects how people make intertemporal tradeoffs and decisions that involve weighing immediate and delayed rewards.

Baker and Emery find that newlywed couples tend to underestimate the chances of eventually divorcing, compared to statistics on divorce rates.  People are unrealistically optimistic when projecting what may happen in their own lives and relationships.

The summaries continue with additional sources in alphabetical order by first author's last name.

 Here is a summary of the works by Robert Cialdini:

Robert Cialdini is a professor of psychology and marketing known for his research on persuasion and social influence. His book Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion (1993) explores the persuasion techniques of social influence and compliance. It introduces six key principles of influence: reciprocity, commitment and consistency, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity. 

Cialdini’s other works expand on these ideas. His article “Crafting Normative Messages to Protect the Environment” (2003) examines how social norms can be activated to encourage pro-environmental behavior. With colleagues, he studied interventions to reduce littering in public places. His revised textbook Influence: Science and Practice (2000) provides an overview of social influence for students and professionals.

Cialdini has also studied preferences for saving lives and the choice paradoxes involved in low-probability, high-consequence events. His research explores how people make decisions under uncertainty and in unfamiliar circumstances. Overall, Cialdini’s work focuses on how social norms and psychological principles shape judgment and decision making in various domains.

The summary outlines Cialdini’s major areas of research, highlighting his well-known studies of persuasion techniques, social influence, and the psychology of decision making. The assistant identifies some of Cialdini’s most influential books and papers spanning over 20 years to provide a high-level sense of the evolution and applications of his work.

 

The study analyzed the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit program that started in 2006. The program offers multiple private plan options for Medicare beneficiaries. The authors examined enrollment numbers and patterns to gain insights into how well the program was meeting the needs of beneficiaries, especially low-income individuals who receive extra subsidies. 

The study found:

1) Many low-income beneficiaries did not enroll in Part D or select a plan that matched their needs. About 25-30% did not enroll at all, and many who did enroll picked plans that did not cover their medications or had high out-of-pocket costs.

2) Low-income beneficiaries had more trouble navigating the complex choice environment and comparing numerous plan options than higher-income beneficiaries. They were more prone to make suboptimal plan choices or avoid enrollment altogether due to feeling overwhelmed.

3) Outreach and education campaigns had only modest success in helping low-income individuals enroll and choose suitable plans. More hands-on, customized assistance and guidance were needed.

4) Auto-enrollment of low-income beneficiaries in benchmark plans with no premium and low out-of-pocket costs showed promising results for improving enrollment and appropriate plan selection. However, some still incurred high drug costs because the plan did not cover their medications.

5) The balance between providing more health care choice and complexity versus less choice and more default options needed to be optimized based on beneficiaries' abilities and willingness to navigate available choices. A one-size-fits-all approach would not work.

The authors concluded that additional program changes and assistance were needed to truly help the most vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries gain access to the drug coverage and financial protection that Part D promised. New models of education, marketing, choice architecture and plan design could help make the program work better for millions of dual-eligible beneficiaries.

 Here are high-level summaries of the requested sources:

• Public Support for Organ Donation vs. Under-Supply of Organs: The Iowa Organ Procurement Study: Surveyed Iowans on their support for organ donation and found high public support but under-supply of organs. Attributed under-supply to failure of next-of-kin to consent to donation requests and suggested policy solutions.

• Golden Eggs and Hyperbolic Discounting: Proposed a theoretical model of "hyperbolic discounting," in which people have a stronger preference for immediate rewards over rewards in the near future. Argued this can lead to dynamic inconsistency and undersaving. 

• Seductive Poison: A survivor's memoir of life in the People's Temple, the cult led by Jim Jones that ended in mass murder-suicide. Described the author's experiences of abuse and mind control that kept members obedient to Jones.

• Remarks on America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP): A speech by Michael Leavitt, Secretary of Health and Human Services, praising private health insurers for their innovations in promoting transparency and value. Argued insurers should lead on preventing chronic disease, investing in information technology, and controlling costs.

• The Emotional Brain: Summarized research on the neurological basis of emotion and its influence on cognition and behavior. Proposed that emotional processing involves connections between the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and other structures. Emotion and reasoning are deeply intertwined rather than separate.

• Final Moments: Damages for Pain and Suffering Prior to Death: Argued that tort law should allow compensating individuals' pain and suffering in the moments before their death due to another's negligence. Considered arguments for and against this view based on concepts of deterrence, corrective justice, and the interests of the estate.

• When Questions Change Behavior: Reported on experiments showing that merely measuring people's intentions or attitudes on certain behaviors can affect the likelihood of those behaviors occurring. For example, asking people about voting increased their propensity to vote. Effects were larger when there was some ambiguity or uncertainty about the behavior.

• Effects of Fear and Specificity of Recommendation upon Attitudes and Behavior: Experiment testing how persuasive communications provoking fear and recommending specific actions influenced attitudes and behavior. Found fear appeals that specified a recommended action, rather than leaving it open-ended, were most effective in motivating behavior change. 

• Reversals of Preference Between Bids and Choices in Gambling Decisions: Reported experiments showing framing effects whereby people's preferences reversed between valuation modes. When choosing between gambles, people preferred low-probability chances of winning large rewards. But when bidding on the same gambles, they preferred high-probability chances of smaller rewards. This reversal was attributed to differences in mental accounting across framing conditions.

 The paper provides a review of the concepts of choice architecture and libertarian paternalism, which aim to guide choices by influencing the context in which people make decisions, without removing options or significantly changing incentives. It discusses various behavioral factors that shape choices, including anchoring and adjustment, availability heuristic, conformity, priming and framing. The paper also considers strategies of choice architects to improve choices, such as providing default options, simplifying complex choices, utilizing mappings, and giving feedback. It examines applications of these strategies in areas like incentives, consumer protection, environmental protection, health, and education. The authors argue for an approach of libertarian paternalism that recognizes human limits but preserves freedom of choice.

- Arguments for (efficiency, freedom of choice) and against (slippery slope, government overreach)
- Applied in various domains, from environment to health care to finance; a "third way"

In summary, the index covers key concepts in behavioral economics, finance, public policy and more - documenting problems arising from human behavior and limitations as well as potential solutions aimed at improving choices and social welfare.

 

- The author explains the concept and importance of choice architecture. Choice architecture is the way options are structured, organized and presented which greatly impacts the choices people make. 

- The influences of defaults, salience and mappings  on choice are discussed. Defaults have a strong anchoring effect. Making certain options more salient or prominent can sway choices. Mappings, or how options are categorized and framed, also impact decisions.

- Heuristics like availability, representativeness and anchoring systematically bias judgement. Rules of thumb are useful but can also lead to errors. Overconfidence in probabilistic knowledge and judgements is common. 

- The two-system model of thinking - reflective and automatic system - is explained. The reflective system is slower and contemplative while the automatic system is fast, intuitive and impressionistic. Choice architecture can be designed to encourage either system.

- The concept of libertarian paternalism is introduced. It means policies designed to influence choices in a way that will make choosers better off while also respecting freedom of choice. Nudges are interventions embodying libertarian paternalism.

- Applications of choice architecture like increasing organ donation, saving for retirement, environment conservation and improving health are discussed. Issues around marriage, contracts and consent are also explored.

- Objections to and limitations of libertarian paternalism and choice architecture are addressed. Paternalism may coerce and reduce autonomy. There are concerns about government overreach and “playing God”. Evaluation of nudges and weighing of plural values are complex with no consensus. But choice architecture can make benevolent designs compatible with freedom.

That covers the essence and main highlights from the summary according to me. Let me know if you would like me to explain or expand on any part of the summary.

 Here is a summary of the document outline:

Part I: Humans and Econs 
- Discusses behavioral biases and tendencies that lead to poor decision making. Explains how choice architecture and nudges can help.

Part II: Money
- Discusses strategies to improve decision making for savings, investments, credit markets, and social security.

Part III: Health
- Discusses strategies to improve decision making for prescription drugs, organ donations, and environmental protection.

Part IV: Freedom
- Discusses strategies to improve school choice, health insurance choice, and marriage. 

Part V: Extensions and Objections
- Provides additional nudges and responses to objections against nudging. Discusses libertarian paternalism.

The document discusses how nudges and choice architecture can help improve decision making in many areas of life including money, health, education, environment, etc. The nudges aim to help people make better choices while still preserving freedom of choice.
