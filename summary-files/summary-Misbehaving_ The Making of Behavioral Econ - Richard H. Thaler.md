The author accepted a job at Cornell University and would start working there in August 1978. He knew he had to do two things: produce research showing what could be learned from his new approach and have convincing responses to objections economists would likely raise against his research.

One common objection was "as if" - the idea that even if people can't solve complex problems, they act as if they can. This view became popular after economists like Kenneth Arrow and Paul Samuelson made the economic theory more mathematical. Though firms likely didn't do marginal analysis, economists argued their behavior approximated the predictions. Milton Friedman said ideas should be judged based on forecasts, not assumptions.

The author responded that Kahneman and Tversky showed people don't act rationally or "as if" they do. Choices that pick dominated options can't be rational. The author titled a paper "Toward a Positive Theory of Consumer Choice" to echo Friedman. He said most people don't act like experts and theories of typical behavior shouldn't assume people act like experts. Ideas of shopping, saving, job hunting, and cooking should reflect how ordinary people behave.

In summary, the key points are:

1. The author expected objections, like "as if," to his new approach
2. "As if" argued that even if assumptions were unrealistic, behavior approximated rational predictions
3. Kahneman and Tversky showed people don't act rationally or "as if" rational
4. The author argued theories should reflect normal behavior, not expert behavior

The author discusses common criticisms that economists level against behavioral economics research, especially research by Kahneman and Tversky. These include:

1. Survey evidence: Economists are skeptical of surveys and prefer complex data. However, many macroeconomic variables like unemployment rates, come from surveys. Economists only accept survey data if they don't collect it themselves.

2. Incentives: Economists believe people will make rational decisions if the stakes are high enough. However, experiments by Grether and Plott found that preference reversals increased when real money was at stake. This suggests incentives don't solve the problems with rational choice theory.

3. Learning: Economists argue that people have opportunities to learn from their mistakes in the real world. However, learning requires frequent practice and feedback, which many real-world decisions must provide. The learning argument also contradicts the incentives argument.

4. Markets: Economists argue that even if individuals are irrational, markets will still be efficient because irrational actors will be outcompeted. However, this "invisible handwave" relies on unrealistic assumptions. Calls can fail and often do, as evidenced by market crashes and bubbles.

The author argues that these criticisms of behavioral economics must be revised and unscientific. Real-world evidence shows that people frequently make irrational decisions, and markets are not perfectly efficient. Behavioral economics provides insights into how people behave that can inform policy and business.

- Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman argued that economic models wrongly assume that humans are rational in their decision making.
- The author of this passage, Richard Thaler, wanted to develop an alternative theory of consumer choice that incorporated psychology
- He called this theory "mental accounting", referring to the intuitive ways people think about money and value
- According to standard economic theory, consumers should decide based on opportunity cost - the value of the following best alternative. But in reality, this type of optimization is too difficult for humans.
- Instead, people use heuristic shortcuts and simplify their thinking by creating separate mental accounts for different types of income, expenses, and assets.
- People may treat a surplus or windfall differently than ordinary income. Or they frame the purchase of an item on sale as a "bargain" without adequately considering the opportunity cost.
- The main point is that human decision making often deviates from the rational model assumed in traditional economics. Mental accounting provides a framework for understanding these deviations.

The key ideas here are:

1. Humans have limited cognitive abilities and do not optimize decisions like rational "Econs."
2. People create simplified mental accounts as a heuristic to make choices
3. These mental accounts often lead to deviations from rational choice, e.g. focusing on bargains rather than opportunity costs.
4. Mental accounting provides an alternative model of behavior that incorporates psychology.

Does this summary accurately reflect the main points and arguments presented in the passage? Let me know if you wantwant me to clarify or expand on any summary part.

Here is a summary of the critical aspects of consumer decision-making discussed:

1. Consumers experience two kinds of utility from purchases:

- Acquisition utility: The satisfaction from acquiring and consuming a product. It depends on how much a consumer values the development.
- Transaction utility: The satisfaction from getting a good deal. It depends on the difference between the actual price paid and the expected reference price. Transaction utility can be positive (for bargains) or negative (for rip-offs).

2. Loss aversion causes consumers to weigh losses more heavily than gains. But for routine purchases, consumers don't usually view the entire cost as a loss. Otherwise, exchanging $10 for $5 would feel like a loss. Instead, the cost is balanced against the acquisition utility and transaction utility gained.

3. Transaction utility causes consumers to pay different prices for the same product depending on the purchase context. For example, consumers were willing to pay more for beer bought from a fancy resort than from a rundown grocery store. Transaction utility depends on expectations about appropriate prices in different contexts.

4. Transaction utility can lead consumers to miss out on worthwhile purchases (if the deal seems too bad) or make poor purchases (if the value looks too good). Companies frequently manipulate reference prices and advertise unrealistically "suggested retail prices" to make discounts appear better.

5. Consumers can become hooked on getting good deals and frequent sales. Some retailers have struggled to switch to "everyday low pricing" because their customers prefer sales and coupons. Macy's and JCPenney are examples of retailers that initially reduced coupons and deals but had to reinstate them due to dropping sales quickly.

That covers the key highlights of how consumers think about their purchasing decisions, the role of different types of utility and loss aversion, the impact of transaction utility on context-dependent pricing, and the challenges of weaning consumers off a diet of frequent deals and sales. Please let me know if you would like me to explain anything in the summary in more detail.

In 2012, JC Penney abandoned traditional retail pricing strategies like coupons and price ending in .99 in favor of an "everyday low price" approach. CEO Ron Johnson admitted that less than 1% of JC Penney's revenue came from total-price purchases. The new pricing scheme rounded prices to the nearest dollar and avoided sales. Although JCPenney claimed consumers were paying the same fees, they missed out on the "transaction utility" of perceiving good deals.

The experiment failed. Sales and stock prices dropped. A year later, Johnson was fired, and coupons returned. Deals have not yet reredto recoveronsumers may not have liked being told that suggested retail prices were "fake."

Large discount retailers like Walmart and Costco successfully use everyday low pricing by providing genuinely low prices and cultivating an image of bargain hunting. JC Penney and Macy's would struggle need helpcate this.

Consumers want good deals to save money or make purchases possible. Businesses should provide sales or genuinely low prices to attract customers. Even affluent consumers enjoy "transaction utility."

The summary highlights the key elements around JC Penney's failed experiment in abandoning traditional retail pricing strategies. It underestimates the importance of cultivating a sense of good deals or "transaction utility" for consumers. The more significant points around businesses needing to provide perceived value and sales and consumers, including affluent ones, enjoying a sense of getting a bargain are also captured. The examples of more successful discount retailers using the everyday low-price model are included in contrast to what JC Penney did.

- Sunk costs like gym memberships or season tickets can motivate people to use the services to avoid wasting the money they spend. But this motivation fades over time as people "forget" the sunk cost.
- Opportunity costs are related to sunk costs. An example is buying an expensive bottle of wine. If you drink it, the opportunity cost is the money you could have made selling it. But people sometimes think differently.
- A study found that about half of people saw drinking an expensive bottle of wine they already owned as either costing nothing or saving them money. The correct view, according to economics, is that the opportunity cost of drinking it is the money they could have made selling it.
- A follow-up study found that most people see buying a case of expensive wine futures as an "investment" rather than spending. But this contradicts seeing drinking the wine as costing nothing. The inconsistent thinking benefits industries like fine wine, as it separates the spending from the consumption.
- The studies show how people use "mental accounting" to think about the costs of things in ways that deviate from standard economic theory. The way we categorize and think about costs is often biased and illogical. But it can benefit some companies and industries.

In summary, the key ideas are:

1. Sunk costs motivate behavior, but people eventually forget them.
2. Opportunity costs are often ignored in people's thinking.
3. Mental accounting leads to consistent and logical thinking about costs.
4. Biased thinking about costs can benefit some companies.

- The original payment for a timeshare or membership is viewed as an investment, not a purchase. The annual fees are annoying, but vacations are then "free." Whether a timeshare makes sense depends on how much a family dislikes paying for holidays. But timeshares should be seen as a way to disguise the cost of holidays.

- Costco and Amazon Prime also charge membership fees that members likely view as sunk costs, giving them another reason to shop there.

- The author admits to some human tendencies in mental accounting. Though good at ignoring sunk costs, cutting passages from his book was hard. took a lot of workg an "outtakes" file helped. With wine, he ignores opportunity costs and doesn't want to know the price he could get by selling an old bottle.

- Households and organizations use budgets, even though money is fungible. Budgets give discretion and control costs but can lead to silly outcomes, like not addressing urgent needs due to lack of funding. Money should be spent to serve interests best, even ignoring budget labels.

- Studies show how budgets influence behavior. MBA students had strict budgets for food, entertainment, and clothes. Those who spent their entertainment budget were less likely to go to a play. A study of gas purchases found consumers were 14 times more likely to buy premium gas when prices dropped, due to "extra" money in their gas budget, even though the money was fungible. They didn't upgrade milk or orange juice.

- In summary, our mental accounting with budgets and investments often fails to needsnize that money is fungible and should be spent to maximize utility. Our budgets and a desire to get "free" things lead us to disguise costs and make suboptimal spending decisions.

- 2007 to 2008 started the financial crisis when most families cut spending. However, some spent more on premium gas.
- People mentally categorize money into accounts like cash, checking, savings, retirement funds, home equity, etc. They are most willing to spend some cash and least willing to spend retirement funds.
- People used to view home equity as sacred, but that view has eroded. Interest rates declined, mortgage brokers made refinancing easy, and people spent gains from rising home values. Home equity fueled spending on cars and other goods.
- The decline in home values caused a more significant drop in spending than the tech bubble decline. Most people only hold stocks in retirement accounts, so stock declines didn't impact them as much.
- It's unclIt needs to be clarified will start paying off mortgages before retirement again. If interest rates rise, they become more appealing. Home equity may remain "leaky."
- Mental accounting is not entirely unreasonable. Budgets and financial plans can help households and businesses spend within their means. But mental accounting can also lead to bad choices, like upgrading your gas during a recession.
- The author noticed that poker players who were losing money behaved differently, taking more risks to try and get back to even, even though the amounts lost were trivial. This shows the effect of narrow mental accounting.
- Prospect theory says that people are risk-seeking in the domain of losses. The author cites Kahneman and Tversky's example of bettors at racetracks taking more risks on long shots in the last race when most are losing.
- However, the author argues that prospect theory must fully explain the behavior he saw in poker players. If people were purely risk-seeking in losses, they would bet on favorites with a good chance of breaking even rather than long shots with little luck. He thought players took longshot bets for a chance at a big win to get back to even due to narrow mental accounting.

- The author collected examples of people engaging in self-control struggles, like removing bowls of cashews to avoid overeating.
  - These examples showed that people sometimes have trouble acting in their long-term self-interest.
- Traditional economics ignores self-control problems by assuming people's choices always reveal their valid preferences.
- The author had frustrating conversations with economists trying to explain self-control issues like removing cashews. Economists wrongly assumed that if people didn't want more cashews, they wouldn't eat them, so removing them was "stupid."
- Early economists like Adam Smith recognized self-control problems, but modern economics largely ignored them.
- The author aimed to study self-control problems, even though economics traditionally assumed they didn't exist.

The key ideas are:

1. People don't always act in their long-term self-interest due to self-control issues.
2. Traditional economics wrongly ignores these self-control problems by assuming choices perfectly reflect preferences.
3. The author set out to formally study self-control problems that economics traditionally overlooked.

Removing cashews illustrates the self-control problem, where people's long-term preferences to avoid overeating conflict with their short-term temptation to eat more nuts. Removing the nuts helps overcome this self-control struggle by eliminating the temptation. But according to standard economics, removing options can never make you better off, so economists wrongly saw this as irrational.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key ideas and examples discussed in the passage? Let me know if you wantwant me to clarify or expand on any summary part.

- Adam Smith laid the foundation for modern economics in his book The Wealth of Nations published in 1776.
- Although Smith's concept of the "invisible hand" is famous, Smith only mentioned it briefly. His point was that individuals pursuing their self-interest could benefit society, but not always only. Sometimes's earlier work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, discussed concepts now considered behavioral economics, like self-control, passions vs. reason, and short-sightedness.
- Other early economists like William Stanley Jevons, Arthur Pigou, and Irving Fisher also discussed intertemporal choice and saw shortsighted or impatient behavior as irrational.
- In 1937, Paul Samuelson created the discounted utility model, which proposed that people value current consumption more than future consumption and discount the value of future events.
- Samuelson's model assumed constant discounting, but he recognized that variable or inconsistent discounting over time could be a limitation.
- Hyperbolic or present-biased discounting, where people heavily discount outcomes shortly but less so further, can lead to preference reversals over time.
- The example of Ted and Matthew illustrates how exponential discounters like Ted stick to their plans, but hyperbolic discounters like Matthew may change their preferences as time passes.

In summary, early economists incorporated insights about human behavior and decision making but discounted utility models that assumed consistent exponential discounting became the standard. Recognizing the limitations of these models has led to current research in behavioral economics on topics like present bias and self-control.

- Ted and Matthew are choosing between three options for attending a tennis tournament: Option A is for next year, Option B is the quarterfinal the year after, and Option C is the final two years from now.
- If the options were for this year, Ted and Matthew would value the options as A: 100, B: 150, C: 180.
- Ted has time-consistent preferences. He would choose Option C, the final in two years, because he values its present value at 146, more than Options A or B. He would still choose C in a year because its current value would be 162, more than B at 150.
- Matthew has time-inconsistent preferences. He would also initially choose Option C, valuing it at 113. But he would switch to Option B in a year, loving C at only 126 but B at 150. His preferences change over time.
- Samuelson's discounted utility model with exponential discounting became the standard model of intertemporal choice, even though Samuelson acknowledged it might not reflect actual behavior. Economists developed "theory-induced blindness," forgetting other work and that the model might be inaccurate.
- Intertemporal choice is essential for understanding consumption. Economists' models of consumption evolved to portray economic agents as wiser and better at self-control.
- Keynes proposed that consumption depends on marginal propensity to consume. Friedman suggested the permanent income hypothesis: people smooth consumption over three years. Modigliani proposed the life-cycle theory that people plan lifetime consumption. The models imply different propensities to consume a $1,000 windfall, from 95% (Keynes) to 3.3% (Modigliani) to 0.625% (Barro) per year.
- The models got more sophisticated but less reflective of how people behave. Keynes' model may most accurately predict behavior. But Modigliani's was judged "best" for its sophistication.

- Robert Barro's model of rational expectations assumes that people are as smart as economists and can anticipate the future perfectly. This is unrealistic. There are limits to how much knowledge and willpower we can assume people have.

- Modigliani's life-cycle hypothesis also assumes people have perfect knowledge and willpower and that all wealth is fungible. This is unrealistic. Mental accounting and human psychology show that people treat different pots of money differently.

- A behavioral life-cycle hypothesis incorporates mental accounting and human psychology. It can better explain consumption behavior.

- Three scholars inspired thinking about self-control:

1. Robert Strotz highlighted the issue of time inconsistency and discussed commitment strategies like Odysseus tying himself to the mast.

2. Walter Mischel ran the famous marshmallow test showing how children struggle with delaying gratification. Situational factors that make the reward more abstract can help people wait longer.

3. George Ainslie discussed the role of hyperbolic discounting, where we disproportionately discount the future. He proposed a strategy of "bundling" a series of short-term rewards into long-term rewards to help overcome this tendency.

- Hyperbolic discounting, where we heavily discount the future, is a crucial issue for self-control. A strategy to overcome it is "bundling" - grouping many short-term rewards into long-term ones. This can make the long-term reward more extensive and more motivating.

To understand savings and self-control, we must incorporate human psychology - how people think and behave in the real world with all our quirks and flaws. Models of perfectly rational behavior are unrealistic. Strategies and situational factors that account for human psychology can help improve self-control.

- Walter Mischel conducted experiments in the 1960s and 1970s where children were offered a small immediate reward (one Oreo cookie) or a larger delayed reward (three cookies). On average, kids could wait about a minute if the tip were visible, but 11 minutes if out of sight. The ability to delay gratification predicted life outcomes.
- George Ainslie reviewed research on self-control in humans and animals. He found that both discount rewards hyperbolically, valuing immediate rewards highly but sharply discounting future rewards. Strategies for self-control include commitment devices to restrict choices and raising the cost of giving in to temptation.
- The author wanted to develop an economic theory of self-control problems. The key question was why someone would restrict their own future choices. This only makes sense if you expect your future preferences to be mistaken.
- The idea of "self-control" implies internal conflict, suggesting a two-self model. Although radical for economists and outdated for psychologists, the author developed a formal model with Hersh Shefrin.
- Their model has a forward-looking planner self and a present-focused doer self. Rather than a competitive game, they used a principal-agent model. The planner is the principal, delegating some control to the doer agent. But the doer agent's interests differ as he pursues immediate rewards. The planner adopts rules and incentives to align the doer's behavior with the planner's long-term interests.

The key ideas are:

1. Self-control problems arise from internal conflicts of interest over time.
2. Strategies for self-control recognize these conflicts and aim to restrain the present-focused self.
3. A two-self model can capture these insights, with a forward-looking self trying to control an impulsive self that pursues immediate rewards.
4. The principal-agent approach is a valuable way to formally model the two-self conflict and the methods the forward-looking self uses to control the impulsive self.

- Agents refers to a series of short-lived decision-makers (called doers), one for each period. The doers care only about their current utility and not future utility.

- The planner cares about the total utility of all the doers over time. The planner has two tools to influence the doers: rewards/penalties (that still give the doers discretion) or rules (that limit the doers' options).

- An example is given of a man named Harry who has 10 energy bars that must last 10 days in a remote cabin. Without intervention, the doers would eat 3 bars each for the first three days, leaving none for the remaining days. The planner wants the doers to eat 1 bar daily to maximize total utility.

- If the planner could use rules (like safes that open 1 per day), that would be ideal. Without regulations, the planner must use guilt to get the doers to eat fewer bars, but this reduces the doers' utility from eating the bars. Practices are best if available but are inflexible and only sometimes possible. Accounting techniques, like dividing money into separate accounts, can also help with self-control.

- The planner-doer model is a metaphor to help think about self-control problems. The planner is like the rational, conscious mind, while the doers are like the impulsive, intuitive mind. The model has been helpful, but the beta-delta model, based on hyperbolic discounting, has become more popular as a formal model of self-control issues.

- The beta-delta model assumes people have normal discounting for the distant future but severely discount the present and near future. This "present bias" leads to time inconsistency and self-control problems. Even a simple version of this model can capture many insights about self-control.

- Whether people know their self-control issues affect intertemporal choice and self-control problems. David Laibson assumed people were "sophisticated" in that they knew about their self-control problems. O'Donoghue and Rabin considered agents " naïve " because they were unaware of their self-control issues. The truth is in between, with "partial naivete," where people underestimate the severity of their self-control problems.

- Thaler gave the example of hot-cold empathy gaps, where people fail to predict self-control problems in the "heat of the moment." When planning a Sunday brunch, people think they will stick to eating healthy dinners during the week. But on Wednesday night, when tempted, they indulge more than predicted. To address this, people may need rules and ways to enforce them, like not allowing midweek beer and pizza outings.

- Thaler applied principles of behavioral economics to help turn around the finances of Greek Peak, a ski resort. To raise ticket prices without losing customers, they gradually grew prices over the years and improved the skier experience to increase perceived value. They made small enhancements free, like a racecourse and ski clinics with instructors. They also offered discounted "six-pack" deals for locals to retain price-sensitive customers. Greek Peak became profitable by applying concepts like reference points, framing, and mental accounting.

- The ski resort wanted to increase weekly and weekend traffic to maximize revenue.
- They offered ten-pack deals, including weekend and weekday lift tickets at 40% off.
- These ten-packs were very popular for several reasons:

1. 40% off seemed like a great deal to customers. It gave them transaction utility.
2. Buying the tickets in advance separated the purchase decision from going skiing. This made spur-of-the-moment ski trips feel "free" to customers since they had already paid. This mental accounting trick encouraged more trips.
3. Customers felt obligated to use the tickets to get their money's worth. This drove more trips significantly as the season progressed.
4. Customers often resolved to ski more the following year but needed a commitment device. The ten-packs served this purpose.
5. The resort got revenue upfront and hedged against a bad snow year. They were guaranteed at least 60% of ticket revenue before the season began.

- The resort also offered coupons for 50% off the next visit when only part of the mountain was open. This seemed generous and drove return visits.
- The pricing strategies successfully reduced the resort's debt and dependence on heavy snowfall.

- Car manufacturers like GM historically had excess inventory before new models came out in August. They used rebates to drive sales, but refunds needed to be more effective.
- GM tried offering very low-interest loans (2.9%) as an alternative. This wildly successful tactic drove a sales surge as customers rushed to claim cars.
- Analysis showed the rebate was a better economic deal, but the low-interest loan seemed more psychologically attractive.
- I observed this paradox and shared the insight with a Cornell colleague consulting for GM. GM ended up contacting me directly to get more details on my analysis.

Here's a summary:

The author was invited to work with his friend Danny Kahneman for a sabbatical year at the University of British Columbia. Danny and his collaborator, Jack Knetsch, had access to free telephone polling through an arrangement with the Canadian government. They used this to research perceptions of fairness in economic transactions.

They asked people about scenarios like a hardware store raising the price of snow shovels the morning after a snowstorm. According to economic theory, raising the price in response to increased demand is appropriate. However, in their poll, 82% of people rated this as unfair. This illustrates how MBAs are taught to think like economists but often need to learn how regular people feel about these situations.

The three researchers spent the year designing questions, analyzing the results, and developing new questions to probe people's views of fairness. This total immersion in collaborative research proved very productive.

- The researchers surveyed people's perceptions of fairness regarding business practices.
- Responses showed that practices like price gouging during emergencies were seen as unfair. Raising prices after a natural disaster angered people.
- They tested variations of scenarios to determine precisely what made a practice seem unfair. For example, they found that auctioning essential goods during an emergency was considered unfair, even if the proceeds went to charity. Price gouging for luxury goods was seen as less unfair.
- They found that perceptions of fairness depend on how a situation is framed. For example, removing a discount was considered less unfair than adding a surcharge. People become accustomed to the status quo, so changes are seen as losses.
- Explaining price increases due to increased costs was usually seen as fair. Cutting wages was typically seen as unfair while failing to raise wages enough to match inflation was more acceptable. This is because actual pay cuts are seen as losses, while inflation-adjusted pay cuts are less visible.
- While the researchers studied perceptions of fairness, they suspected that successful firms try to behave in ways that at least appear fair. Seeming fair is especially important for long-term businesses that want to keep customers. However, some firms still misjudge what seems reasonable and anger their customers and employees.
- Price gouging after disasters is seen as unfair, yet some "entrepreneurial" sellers still do it to make a quick profit. In contrast, stores like Home Depot gave away supplies after disasters to build goodwill.
- The fact that many students saw price gouging after disasters as acceptable shows that intuitions about fairness can be misguided, and firms must carefully consider their customers' perspectives.

Here's a summary:

- In the 1990s, First Chicago Bank introduced a $3 fee for customers who conducted routine transactions with a teller instead of using an ATM. The public reacted negatively to this new policy, seeing it as greedy and unfair. Competitors attacked the bank in ads, and negative publicity eventually caused the bank to abandon the policy.

- Coca-Cola's CEO Douglas Ivester resigned after suggesting the company would raise vending machine prices dynamically during events like soccer games. Customers saw this as unfair price gouging.

- When Whitney Houston died, the price of her albums spiked 60% on iTunes in the UK, angering customers. Even though demand had increased, raising prices during this temporary spike seemed unfair.

- Firms are not always punished for seeming unfair, though. If competitors follow a first mover's lead in raising prices or adding new fees, customers may have little choice but to accept them. But first movers still take a risk, especially if competitors still need to follow.

- Uber's use of "surge pricing," where prices can jump over ten times average during peak demand, has led to complaints of unfair price gouging, especially during emergencies like snowstorms. Under pressure, Uber agreed to cap surge pricing during emergencies in New York.

- The summary is that companies should avoid seeming greedy or unfair, especially during temporary spikes in demand. Raising prices drastically during emergencies or tragic events often leads to public outrage and backlash. While surging demand is an opportunity to increase revenue, companies must weigh this against potential damage to their reputation and customer goodwill.

- The authors conducted experiments to study people's fairness preferences and willingness to punish unfair behavior.
- In the Ultimatum Game, one player proposes how to split a sum of money with another player, who can accept or reject the offer. If left, both get nothing. Economic theory predicts people will take any favorable offer. But the authors found bids below 20% of the total were often rejected, showing people care about fairness.
- They were disappointed to find the Ultimatum Game had already been studied. But they designed another experiment, the Dictator Game, where one player unilaterally splits money with another. Surprisingly, most players split evenly.
- In the Punishment Game, new players could split the money evenly with a "fair" player from the Dictator Game or unevenly with an "unfair" player, sacrificing some money. Most chose the fair player, showing a willingness to punish unfairness.
- The authors argue companies should consider fairness and long-term customer relationships. Price gouging, like Uber's surge pricing during crises, creates resentment and enemies. Capping price increases and avoiding extremes can build goodwill.
- As examples, they discuss a ski lodge owner who kept holiday prices modest to maintain loyalty and a restaurant that used demand-based pricing but kept multiples reasonable. The restaurant owners argued that while customers might pay very high costs, they wouldn't feel it was worth it and wouldn't return.
- In summary, the research and examples show that companies should consider fairness, customer satisfaction, and long-term relationships while maximizing short-term profits. Unfairness can be punished through lost business and reputation. Modest, proportional price increases are preferable to extremes that leave customers feeling exploited.

- People dislike unfair offers and are willing to incur a cost to punish dishonest behavior. However, one cannot conclude that people always behave pretty themselves. In the Ultimatum Game, proposers offering 40-50% of the pie may act rationally to avoid rejection rather than out of a sense of fairness.

- The results of the Ultimatum Game are robust across cultures. Proposers tend to offer 40-50%, and responders tend to reject offers below 20%. However, as the stakes increase, the minimum acceptable bid does not decrease proportionally. Even in high-stakes games, proposers continue to make relatively fair offers.

- In the Prisoner's Dilemma, the rational selfish strategy is for both players to defect. However, in experiments, 40-50% of players cooperate, suggesting people do not always act purely selfishly.

- In the Public Goods Game, the rational selfish strategy is for no one to contribute anything. However, in experiments, people contribute about half of their stake on average, though contributions decrease over repeated game plays. This suggests people can act like "social morons" following only self-interest but also behave as "conditional cooperators" who match the cooperation of others. Collaboration can be sustained if players are allowed to punish non-cooperators.

- In summary, experiments show that while people often cooperate and prefer fair outcomes, they can also act selfishly, especially if they think others are behaving unfairly or selfishly. A willingness to punish non-cooperators plays an essential role in sustaining cooperation.

The author experimented with his colleague Jack Knetsch and some students to test the endowment effect. They wanted to design an experiment to convince economists Charlie Plott and Vernon Smith that the endowment effect was natural.

They built on Knetsch's original experiment by adding a market context. They used Vernon Smith's "induced value" method to rule out alternative explanations. In this method, subjects are given tokens that have no value outside the experiment but are told they will receive money for any tickets they end up with. The experimenters randomly gave subjects different values for the tokens. They also randomly distributed some tokens to half the issues.

Economic theory predicts that the subjects who value the tokens most should have all the tickets after trading in the market. So if there are 12 subjects and six passes, three tokens should change hands on average.

They then repeated the same experiment but with chocolate bars instead of tokens. Economic theory again predicts half the chocolate bars will change hands. But if there is an endowment effect, fewer trades should happen because those who randomly receive chocolate bars will value them more.

In their experiment, 44 students were given different values for 22 tokens, and half were randomly given tickets. They were then asked at what prices they would be willing to buy or sell tokens. This revealed their "reservation prices," the lowest price at which they'd sell (for those with tickets) or the highest price at which they'd buy (for those without). These reservation prices were then used to run a market to see how many trades happened.

As predicted, the key result was that fewer trades happened with the chocolate bars than with the tokens. This supported the existence of an endowment effect, showing that people valued the chocolate bars more highly simply because they were endowed with them, even though the allocations were random. This contradicted the standard economic prediction that the initial distribution of goods shouldn't matter.

In conclusion, the experiment provides evidence for an endowment effect and a more nuanced view of human nature than that suggested by standard economic theory. People are not always the rational self-interest maximizers that economists often assume.

- The tools of supply and demand are taught in any introductory economics class. The experiment matched buyers and sellers based on their reservation prices, which are the maximum (minimum) prices that buyers (sellers) are willing to pay (accept) for goods. About 11 trades were predicted to occur based on this matching.

- Three trial runs with tokens found that the actual number of trades was close to the prediction, showing the subjects understood the exercise. The experiment then used authentic goods, coffee mugs, and pens.

- With authentic goods, significantly fewer trades occurred than predicted, around 4-5. This was because sellers valued the items they were endowed with much higher due to the endowment effect and loss aversion. Buyers were only willing to pay about half the asking price of sellers. This shows that losses are perceived as more painful than equal gains.

- The endowment effect and loss aversion lead to inertia and a status quo bias, where people stick with what they have. An amusing example is how the coffee mug experiment has been replicated many times since.

- Around 1986, behavioral economics started to engage more with the mainstream economics profession. A conference at the University of Chicago debated rational economics versus behavioral economics. Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman presented behavioral findings like the Asian disease problem and fairness games that challenged standard economic thinking. The debate highlighted the tensions between the camps but brought more exposure to behavioral economics.

- The key points are: 1) The endowment effect, loss aversion, and status quo bias lead people to stick with their endowments and current situations. 2) Early debates between behavioral and rational economists surfaced many of the violations of economic theory posed by behavioral findings. 3) Experiments with real money and goods provided compelling evidence for behavioral effects that challenged standard economics.

Here's a summary:

- Kenneth Arrow gave a talk arguing that rationality is neither necessary nor sufficient for good economic theory. Rationality alone does not produce valuable predictions, and models don't have to be rational or sensible to be rigorous.

- The author had to act as a discussant for papers by Herbert Simon, Danny Kahneman, Amos Tversky, and others. He decided to employ humor to critique their articles without seeming presumptuous, citing an essay by George Stigler parodying repetitive comments at conferences.

- The next day, Franco Modigliani won the Nobel Prize in Economics. Merton Miller, who was supposed to speak that day, had collaborated with Modigliani but was not included in the prize. Miller joked that their work showed taking money from one pocket and putting it in another doesn't change your wealth. This referred to their irrelevance theorem but also applied to Modigliani's life-cycle hypothesis.

- Miller's paper responded to a behavioral finance critique of the irrelevance theorem by Shefrin and Statman. The theorem assumed no taxes, but dividends and stock repurchases were taxed differently, contradicting the theorem. Miller argued "institutional forces" like this didn't matter and began insulting Shefrin and Statman's intelligence. The author thought Miller's response was misguided and refused to contribute to the criticism.

- In summary, the conference featured discussions of rationality in economics, the life-cycle hypothesis, the irrelevance theorem, and behavioral critiques of traditional theory. The author aimed for a balanced perspective, arguing against dismissive responses to behavioral approaches.

- Company dividend payments were puzzling because dividends were taxed at high rates while capital gains were taxed at lower rates. Companies should not pay dividends but instead use the funds to repurchase shares, generating shareholder capital gains.
- Shefrin and Statman proposed combining mental accounting and self-control could explain dividend payments. Some shareholders, like retirees, prefer dividends that feel like "income" to spend the money without feeling bad. This behavior persists even though, rationally, shareholders could generate the same income by selling shares.
- Merton Miller critiqued Shefrin and Statman's hypothesis, but his explanations were weak. He admitted that the best model for how companies set dividends was actually "behavioral." He also said that investors have many irrational reasons for their investment decisions, but they are "too interesting" to consider.
- In the debate, Robert Shiller argued that incorporating psychology into finance models could enhance rather than replace them. He said efficient market models could be seen as "extreme special cases" that would be more useful if expanded to include more realistic behavioral factors.
- For a paradigm shift like the one proposed by behavioral finance, many anomalies that contradict the prevailing theory must be recognized. Richard Thaler was interested in whether this could happen in economics but was hesitant to suggest his work could spark such a revolution, especially early in his career.

The key points are:

1. There were anomalies, like dividend payments, that standard finance theory struggled to explain.
2. Shefrin and Statman proposed a behavioral explanation for dividends based on mental accounting and self-control.
3. Merton Miller's critique of their theory was weak, and he even admitted behavioral factors were important to consider.
4. Robert Shiller argued behavioral finance could enhance standard models by making them more realistic.
5. For a paradigm shift like behavioral finance to take hold, many anomalies contradicting the prevailing theory must be apparent. Richard Thaler was interested in whether this was possible in economics.

Here's a summary:
• The Journal of Economic Perspectives anomalies articles documented empirical findings inconsistent with the standard economic paradigm.
• The articles covered a broad range of topics using various methods, though many focused on anomalies in finance.
• Some anomalies were just strange empirical facts without a reasonable explanation, like calendar effects in the stock market - e.g., stocks going up on Fridays, in January, and before holidays.  
• One anomaly was that bettors at racetracks seem to systematically overbet on longshots, even though the betting amounts determine the odds. All bets should have the same expected return if the market is efficient.
• The anomalies articles reached over 5,000 economists, far more than a typical academic paper. The goal was to document many anomalies to build a case for revising the standard paradigm.
• Not all anomalies had a good behavioral explanation. Some were just facts that didn't fit with economic theory. The articles aimed to dispel the notion that monsters only appear in experiments.  
• Writing the articles was very time-consuming but also potentially impactful. Recruiting expert coauthors helped in covering various topics.

The key ideas are:
Documenting anomalies that challenge the standard paradigm.
Reaching a broad audience.
Covering a range of topics, methods, and data sources.
Building a cumulative case for needed changes.
Investing a lot of time to do impactful work.

- The average return from betting is 17%, but the return is higher for betting on favorites (around 90 cents per dollar) and much lower for longshots (around 14 cents per dollar).

- The author wrote "Anomalies" for 14 issues discussing behavioral economics. The columns were published as a book called The Winner's Curse. The column was later retired.

- The author wanted to build a team to establish behavioral economics as a field. New fields usually emerge slowly as people gradually get interested in a topic, but the author wanted to speed up the process.

- In the late 1980s, there were only three other behavioral economists: George Loewenstein, Robert Shiller, and Colin Camerer. Camerer made significant contributions to behavioral game theory and neuroeconomics.

- Eric Wanner, a psychologist and program officer at the Sloan Foundation, provided funding for the author's sabbatical and later helped build the field of behavioral economics.

- They organized meetings with top psychologists and economists to combine the fields, but the sessions could have been more productive. The psychologists and economists struggled, needed help communicating, and wanted to see actual research, not just discuss ideas.

- They thought behavioral economics would have to be an interdisciplinary field with psychologists and economists working together. But while a few psychologists participated, most of the progress was made by economists. Interdisciplinary conferences often do not work well because people from different fields need help understanding each other.

- Overall, the column, funding from Eric Wanner, and meetings with psychologists helped establish the case for and build interest in behavioral economics, even though true collaboration between psychologists and economists remained elusive. Progress was driven mainly by economists.

- Behavioral economics started as an interdisciplinary field combining insights from economics and psychology.

- Early collaborations between economists and psychologists could have been more successful. Psychologists were not interested in studying deviations from rational choice theory and found the psychology used by behavioral economists to need to be updated. Studying applied problems was seen as low status by psychologists.

- Behavioral economists have yet to generate new psychological insights successfully. Most advances have been in modifying economic tools to account for human behavior rather than discovering new behavioral insights. Only George Loewenstein, a behavioral economist, and psychologist, has created much new psychology.

- To foster the growth of behavioral economics, the Russell Sage Foundation formed the Behavioral Economics Roundtable in 1992. The roundtable organized summer programs to train graduate students in behavioral economics.

- The first summer program in 1994 was very successful. It attracted top students who became leaders in the field, such as David Laibson and Sendhil Mullainathan. These summer programs helped encourage talented graduate students to consider careers as behavioral economists.

- Notable participants in the first summer program included:

- Ernst Fehr: An economist interested in fairness and reciprocity. He showed that firms that pay higher wages often benefit from higher effort and lower turnover.

- Matthew Rabin: Developed an influential theory explaining how people can be generous and spiteful, depending on perceived fairness. He suggested that people are friendly to those who treat them well and mean to those who mistreat them.

- David Laibson: Now a leader in behavioral economics. He participated as a student in the first summer program.

- Sendhil Mullainathan: A pioneer in applying behavioral economics to policy. He co-founded ideas42, a behavioral economics think tank.

- Linda Babcock and Christine Jolls have run a summer camp for behavioral economists for ten years. The center has produced many prominent scholars in the field. The research from the base helped establish behavioral economics as a mainstream part of economics. The camp was funded by Eric Wanner, who supported the founding of behavioral economics.

- The authors discuss the limitations of interdisciplinary collaboration. While some fields, like neuroscience, have succeeded, the authors' experience with interdisciplinary meetings could have been much better. However, the area of judgment and decision-making, founded by Kahneman and Tversky, continues to thrive with many scholars and an annual conference. While the authors attend the meeting, most behavioral economists do not collaborate with psychologists.

- The Russell Sage Foundation supported behavioral economics through its visiting scholar program. In 1991-1992, Kahneman, Tversky, Camerer, and Treisman were visiting scholars. Kahneman and Tversky aimed to recreate their past successful collaboration but faced many distractions. However, they were both interested in "narrow framing," or when people treat events separately rather than as a whole portfolio.

- Kahneman and Lovallo proposed that managerial decision-making stems from two biases: bold forecasts (the "inside view") and timid choices (due to loss aversion). The inside view leads to optimism, while the outside view, based on base rates, is more accurate. Even Kahneman fell victim to the inside view, underestimating the time to complete a book by several years. Loss aversion and organizational incentives can make managers overly risk-averse.

- Kahneman gave an example of executives unwilling to take on a risk-neutral investment opportunity due to loss aversion and narrow framing. The CEO recognized that undertaking many such options could be profitable, indicating a problematic incentive system that discouraged risk-taking.

- The CEO wanted to undertake 23 risky projects, but managers were reluctant due to narrow framing and loss aversion. They only considered the projects individually instead of as a portfolio and feared being fired if any project failed. This led the firm to take on too little risk.

- Aggregating investments into a pool can help address narrow framing by allowing managers to consider the overall potential benefits. The author gives an example of a pharmaceutical company that invested billions in R&D but was reluctant to run a small experiment on drug pricing due to narrow framing.

- The author argues that in many cases, the principal or boss is to blame for not creating an environment where managers feel comfortable taking reasonable risks. He calls these "dumb principal" problems.

- The author worked with Shlomo Benartzi on the equity premium puzzle. The puzzle refers to the fact that historically, stocks have returned about 6% more per year than Treasury bills, which seems too large based on standard economic theory. After analyzing the problem, the author and Benartzi concluded that the puzzle arises from narrow framing and investor loss aversion.

- The author describes an example from Paul Samuelson showing loss aversion and inconsistent preferences. Samuelson's colleague refused to take a single bet where he could win $200 or lose $100 but was willing to take 100 such chances. Samuelson proved this needed to be more consistent.

- The key conclusions are that narrow framing, loss aversion, and dumb principals can lead to poor risk-taking and investment decisions in individuals and firms. Recognizing and addressing these issues can help solve economic problems and improve outcomes.

- Samuelson argued that if you don't like one bet, you shouldn't take many. He gave an example of his colleague who turned down a single chance but accepted 100 repetitions of the same event. Samuelson said this was a "fallacy of large numbers" - misunderstanding that the law of large numbers reduces risk.

- Thaler and Benartzi disagreed. They said the mistake was turning down the single bet due to "narrow framing." Accepting the 100 bets has a high expected value and a tiny chance of losing a lot. Turning down a single good bet is illogical. They called this "myopic loss aversion."

- They tested this with an experiment on how people invest in retirement plans. When shown distributions of annual returns, people invested 40% in stocks. When shown 30-year average returns, people invested 90% in stocks. This indicates that how data is presented affects risk-taking.

- Another experiment had people act as portfolio managers. Those who saw results more often invested more conservatively (41% in stocks) than those who saw yearly or 5-year results (70% in stores). This also shows that frequent feedback increases loss aversion and reduces risk-taking.

- A natural experiment in Israel supported this. When retirement funds started reporting 1-year returns instead of monthly, investors shifted more money to stocks, traded less, and chased returns less. This shows reducing frequent feedback helps investors make better long-term choices.

- The key conclusions are: 1) Narrow framing and myopic loss aversion lead people to make poor risk-taking decisions. 2) Less frequent feedback helps overcome these biases and leads to better long-term risk-taking. 3) How data is presented substantially influences behavior due to human psychological biases.

Here is a summary of the equity premium puzzle:

- The equity premium puzzle refers to the historical fact that stocks have
  outperformed bonds by a surprisingly large margin. Looking at historical data,
  investors would have needed to evaluate their portfolios extremely often, about
  once a year, to be indifferent between stocks and bonds. A portfolio with a
  50-50 mix of stocks and bonds would not make sense based on the returns.

- The implication is that the high returns of stocks called the equity premium,
  exists because investors evaluate their portfolios too frequently. Investors would
  be better off buying a diversified stock portfolio, especially when young, and
  avoiding constantly monitoring it. Looking at it infrequently, like once a
  year, would make the hefty equity premium seem reasonable.

- Thaler and colleague Benartzi studied how often investors would need to
  evaluate their portfolios to find stocks and bonds equally attractive based on
  historical returns. They found the answer was about once a year, indicating
  investors likely monitor too often, creating the equity premium puzzle.

- The high frequency of monitoring leads investors to overvalue the short-term
  volatility and risks of stocks relative to their long-term returns. Investors would
  be better served by less frequent monitoring of the market and their portfolios.
  Infrequent monitoring, like annually or when rebalancing, would make the
  long-term outperformance of stocks a more reasonable reward for their risk.

- In summary, the equity premium puzzle refers to stocks outperforming bonds
  by too large a margin historically. Thaler and Benartzi found this was likely due
  to investors evaluating and adjusting their portfolios too frequently, overweighting
  the short-term risks of stocks. Less frequent monitoring could help resolve the
  puzzle by putting the returns of stocks and bonds in a better perspective.

- The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) was the dominant view among economists, especially financial economists when Richard Thaler began studying behavioral economics.
- The EMH states that financial markets are efficient, meaning that asset prices reflect all available information, and it is impossible to beat the market.
- There are two primary components of the EMH:

1. The "price is right" - Asset prices reflect the asset's intrinsic value. If a company's intrinsic value is $100 million, its market cap will be $100 million.
2. The "no free lunch" principle - It is impossible to predict future stock price movements and earn excess returns because all public information is reflected in current prices.

- Eugene Fama coined the term "efficient market hypothesis" and established it as the dominant theory of financial markets. He taught at the University of Chicago.
- Early tests of the EMH and the work of scholars like Michael Jensen confirmed the theory. However, the EMH was challenging to test directly because the intrinsic value is unobservable.
- The rise of financial economics and the EMH was enabled by greater computing power, the availability of data (especially from the Center for Research in Security Prices), and the work of theorists like Markowitz, Miller, and Sharpe.
- Keynes had insights about financial markets and human behavior that challenged the EMH, but his work was overlooked as the EMH gained prominence. Keynes believed "animal spirits" or emotions played an important role in financial decision-making.

- Most economists were highly skeptical that Thaler would find evidence contradicting the EMH, especially in financial markets. The prevailing view was that behavioral anomalies would not have a meaningful impact on asset prices. But Thaler reasoned that finding such evidence in finance would make people take notice.

- John Maynard Keynes doubted the efficiency of financial markets. He thought markets were more efficient early in the 20th century when managers owned most company shares. As shares became more widely held, "the element of real knowledge in the valuation of investments by those who own them or contemplate purchasing them...seriously declined."

- By the 1930s, Keynes thought markets had become irrational. He noted that stock prices of ice companies were higher in summer, though their long-term value shouldn't change with the seasons. This violates the efficient market hypothesis.

- Keynes doubted that professional investors would make markets efficient. Instead, they were prone to "irrational exuberance" and followed the crowd. It was risky to bet against the market consensus. Investing was like a competition to pick the prettiest faces from photos, where you tried to anticipate what others would like.

- To illustrate this, a "beauty contest" game asks people to guess 2/3 of the average guess between 0 to 100. The only "Nash equilibrium" is for all to think 0. But people assume higher, trying to anticipate what others will guess. An experiment with Financial Times readers found a winning guess of 13, showing a mix of sophistication and cluelessness.

- Explanations for guesses showed poetic, political, and familial logic. The game illustrates how investors try to anticipate and benefit from others' future valuations rather than identify fundamentally cheap or high-growth stocks. The market is a beauty contest.

The key points are:

1. The researcher wanted to use a finding from psychology to predict a previously unknown effect in the stock market.

2. Kahneman and Tversky found that people make extreme forecasts based on limited data. In their experiment, subjects made extreme GPA predictions based on a student's "sense of humor" score, even though there was little reason to believe that sense of humor correlated with GPA.

3. The researcher hypothesized that investors might similarly overreact to daily stock market information, as Keynes suggested.

4. Value investing, which aims to find undervalued stocks, provides circumstantial evidence for overreaction. The assumption is that investors have overreacted to bad news about specific stocks, pushing their prices down too far.

5. The researcher tested for overreaction by examining how winning and losing stocks performed in the subsequent 3-5 years. If investors overreact, losing stocks should outperform winning stocks over the longer run.

6. They found clear evidence of overreaction. Losing stocks outperformed winning stocks in subsequent years. For example, the worst-performing 20% of stocks beat the best-performing 20% by about 25 percentage points per year over the next 3-5 years.

7. This "anomalous" finding challenged the efficient market hypothesis and provided evidence for psychologist Robert Shiller's view that investor sentiment plays a vital role in the stock market.

Benjamin Graham advocated buying stocks that were priced below their intrinsic value. He proposed using the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to identify undervalued stocks. Stocks with a low P/E were "cheap," while those with a high P/E were "expensive." Graham showed that a cheap Dow Jones Industrial Average portfolio outperformed expensive Dow stocks from 1937 to 1969.

By the early 1980s, most financial economists considered Graham's value investing approach outdated and inconsistent with the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). However, studies in the late 1970s and early 1980s by Sanjoy Basu and Rolf Banz found evidence supporting Graham's strategy, although they apologized for their findings.

David Dreman was the first to propose a psychological explanation for value investing based on investors' tendency to extrapolate recent trends into the future. Dreman's 1982 book hypothesized that growth stocks become overpriced because investors become overly optimistic about their future growth, while value stocks become underpriced due to excessive pessimism. This sets the stage for the prices to revert to normal, leading value stocks to outperform.

Werner De Bondt and Richard Thaler tested for evidence of investor overreaction by examining the performance of past stock market "winners" and "losers." They hypothesized that if investors overreact, the past losers should outperform the past winners going forward as prices regress to intrinsic value. Their analysis of NYSE stocks over 3- to 5-year formation and holding periods found strong evidence supporting this hypothesis. The loser portfolio outperformed the winner portfolio, suggesting that investors had overreacted to the past performance of these stocks.

They presented these findings at the American Finance Association conference. Their paper was selected for publication in a special issue of the Journal of Finance devoted to reports from the forum. Their evidence of overreaction in stock prices contradicted the EMH and provided empirical support for investor psychology in explaining market anomalies.

- Papers for an AFA conference were selected partly based on nominations from session organizers. The papers were published quickly without peer review.

- The author and his coauthor submitted a paper showing that "loser" stocks earned higher returns than the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) predicted. The session organizer nominated their writing, and the AFA president chose to publish it.

- The results contradicted the EMH, so supporters argued that higher returns must be due to higher risk. The standard risk measure, beta, did not show the losing stocks were riskier. Supporters needed another explanation.

- Fama and French published papers showing small stocks and value stocks earned excess returns. They proposed a three-factor model, including size and value, to explain the results while preserving market efficiency. The factors lacked theoretical justification.

- A 1994 paper argued value stocks are not riskier. The authors later started a successful money management firm based on value investing.

- Fama and French recently proposed a five-factor model. There still needs to be evidence value stocks are riskier. Fama concedes the source of the value premium needs to be clarified.

- The author argues the initial results showing loser stocks outperform support the behavioral overreaction hypothesis, not the EMH. But Fama and French have discussed the value premium could be due to rational risk factors, not mispricing. The debate continues.

The key debate is whether the excess returns of value and small stocks are due to mispricing and market inefficiency (the behavioral position) or rational risk factors (the efficient market position). The author sides with the behavioral view, but Fama and French argue that market efficiency can be preserved.

- The efficient market hypothesis has two components: 1) you can't beat the market (no free lunch), and 2) prices are "right."

- Robert Shiller questioned the second principle. He found that stock price variability was too high to be justified by dividend changes. Stock prices were attempts to forecast the present value of future dividends, but the forecasts varied much more than the actual dividends.

- Shiller's finding was controversial but largely vindicated by the extreme stock market volatility of October 1987, when there was no major news to justify the large price swings. This showed that prices could be "wrong."

- Shiller later proposed that social dynamics and "animal spirits" could influence stock prices, just like they influence fashion trends. This was a radical idea for economists.

- Although Shiller's work primarily challenged the "price is right" view, it also relates to the "no free lunch" view. Shiller showed you could beat the market by buying when the overall market price-to-earnings ratio is low (stocks are cheap) and avoiding stocks when the balance is high (stores are expensive). The market P/E ratio tends to revert to its historical mean over time.

- However, implementing a strategy based on the overall market's P/E ratio takes a lot of work. There needs to be more certainty about when reversion to the mean will happen—an investor risks underperforming the market for a long time before the reversal occurs. So, while the research is intriguing theoretically, it does not provide a leisurely "free lunch" in practice.

Shiller's research presented a severe challenge to the efficient market hypothesis by showing that stock prices can deviate substantially from intrinsic value and that these deviations could be exploited. However, implementing an effective trading strategy based on these findings has proven difficult.

- Robert Shiller warned in 1996 that stock and home prices seemed dangerously high. Although his warnings eventually proved right, the timing could have been better. Anyone following his advice in 1996 would have lost money for years before the markets crashed.

- Shiller worked with Karl Case to develop the Case-Shiller home price index, which improved on previous measures by tracking the prices of the same homes over time. Their data showed home prices grew slowly for decades before shooting up in the mid-1990s.

- The imprecision of Shiller's forecasts shows that while deviations from historical price levels can signal overvaluations, the signals are hard to act on, and the timing of market turns is hard to predict. Investors should be wary of overheating calls but expect only partially to time them.

- To test whether prices accurately reflect fundamental value, we can check whether the law of one price holds. This law says the same asset can't trade at two different prices, or there would be an arbitrage opportunity. Closed-end mutual funds blatantly violate this law, often selling at 10-20% discounts to their net asset value.

- The author met Charles Lee, a doctoral student interested in behavioral finance, and they studied why closed-end fund shares don't trade at net asset value. They found the discounts were primarily driven by sentiment and investor psychology, not by rational factors like fees or illiquidity. This evidence contradicted the efficient market hypothesis.

- Their research on closed-end funds provided some of the first solid evidence that security prices can deviate from intrinsic value due to sentiment and psychological factors. It helped legitimize behavioral finance as a field.

- Charles Lee wrote a paper on closed-end funds for a doctoral course taught by Richard Thaler.

- Around the same time, Larry Summers and some students wrote about "noise traders," who make investment decisions based on trivial factors rather than actual news. They pointed to closed-end funds as an example.

- Lee, Thaler, and Andrei Shleifer built on Lee's paper to further study closed-end funds. They identified four puzzles:

1. Why do people buy funds at a high initial price when the price predictably drops soon after? The only explanation is, "There are idiots."

2. Why do the fund's trade at a discount to the value of their holdings?

3. Why do the discounts vary so much over time and between funds? Simple explanations like high fees don't account for this.

4. When funds change into open-end funds, the price converges to the net asset value. So the net asset value was not miscalculated.

- They proposed that "investor sentiment"—the changing moods of individual investors—drives the discount variation. When sentiment is high, discounts shrink; when it's low, values increase.

- They found evidence for this theory—discounts on closed-end funds correlated with the difference in returns between small and large company stocks. Individual investors own more small-company and closed-end fund shares, so their sentiment impacts both.

- Their paper upset Merton Miller, who attacked their findings in comments published with their writing. After several rounds of responses, the debate brought attention to the report.

- The critical point is that closed-end funds blatantly violate the "law of one price." But the debate over terminology obscured this discovery.

- Owen Lamont was not originally a behavioral economist. He was an open-minded researcher who liked to challenge conventional wisdom.

- At a 1999 conference, Owen pointed out a blatant violation of the law of one price in the stock prices of 3Com and Palm. 3Com owned 95% of Palm, so 3Com's stock price should have been worth at least 1.5 times Palm's. But after Palm's IPO, Palm's stock price jumped while 3Com's fell, implying 3Com's remaining business was worth minus $23 billion, an irrational result.

- Two things are needed for such a large violation of the law of one price: (1) "noise traders" or "idiots" who irrationally prefer Palm stock over the better deal of 3Com stock; and (2) a lack of "smart money" to correct the mispricing, which in this case was due to a shortage of Palm shares available to short.

- Similar mispricings between Royal Dutch and Shell shares lasted for decades because there did not impede the smart money-making the correction trade. But the riskiness and unpredictability of noise trader behavior meant smart money like LTCM could get caught on the wrong side and suffer significant losses.

- The key takeaway is that irrational noise traders, not rational investors, drove the stock prices of technology companies and other firms in the late 1990s. More than reasonable smart money is needed to correct mispricings.

- In 1998, 3Com spun off its Palm division. Due to a temporary supply-demand imbalance, shares of Palm were priced higher than 3Com even though 3Com owned 95% of Palm. This violated the law of one price and was an obvious arbitrage opportunity. However, arbitrage was difficult in practice due to short-selling constraints, transaction costs, and limits of arbitrage.
- The Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) hedge fund collapsed in 1998 after losing money in Russia and Asia. Like other hedge funds, LTCM had bet on the Royal Dutch Shell arbitrage trade. When LTCM and others had to unwind positions due to losses, the business moved against them, worsening losses in a vicious cycle. This showed the "limits of arbitrage" - smart money cannot always correct mispricings.
- These examples show that apparent pricing anomalies can persist, and the EMH does not always hold. The market can sometimes not "add and subtract" correctly. While the EMH is helpful as a benchmark, the price is often "wrong" and sometimes very wrong.
- The "no-free-lunch" component of the EMH - that is beating the market is complex - is "mostly true." But the "price-is-right" part - that the market price accurately reflects fundamental value - is often wrong, sometimes by a factor of 2 or 3.
- When the market is this inefficient, the misallocation of resources can be significant. Housing bubbles, for example, were fueled by irrational optimism and lax lending standards. Policymakers should recognize bubbles are possible and consider preventive action.
- The EMH should not be taken as faith that "prices are always right." Doing so can lead to failing to recognize the need for reform even after catastrophes. Policymakers need to take action to reduce the crisis likelihood.

In summary, while useful as a theoretical benchmark, the EMH often does not exist. Pricing anomalies and misallocation of resources can be substantial when it fails. Policymakers should not assume prices are always correct but recognize the possibility of bubbles and consider preventive measures.

- The author was offered a position at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business in 1994. Some faculty members were skeptical about hiring him due to his unconventional approach. However, the school hired him to allow the next generation to make their own mistakes.

- In 1995, the author was invited to discuss applying behavioral economics to law. He collaborated with Christine Jolls, an economist, and lawyer, to develop the talk. Although the author could not attend the conference, the speech was well-received.

- The author and Jolls decided to expand the talk into an academic paper on behavioral law and economics. They collaborated with Cass Sunstein, a University of Chicago Law School professor, to write the essay. The resulting 76-page paper with 220 footnotes was the most extended paper the author had ever written.

- They submitted the paper to multiple law reviews simultaneously, as is customary in law. The Stanford Law Review accepted the report and agreed to solicit a commentary from Richard Posner, a prominent law and economics scholar, to publish alongside the paper. Posner, who founded the law and economics movement, was expected to be critical of their behavioral approach.

- Posner sent them a highly critical, emotional multi-page letter with his comments the day before the authors presented the paper at the University of Chicago Law School. He said he wrote the letter so he could remain silent during their talk. The debate reflected the tension between traditional law and economics supporters and those interested in alternative approaches like behavioral economics.

- The author was asked to present the paper, as he had more experience in such debates. The talk and discussion went well, and the Stanford Law Review published not just Posner's commentary but two additional critiques and the authors' replies. The resulting publication brought widespread attention to behavioral law and economics.

In summary, the passage describes the origins and development of the behavioral law and economics paper, including collaborating with Christine Jolls and Cass Sunstein, submitting to law reviews, soliciting Richard Posner's critical commentary, presenting and debating the form, and ultimately publishing the paper and responses in the Stanford Law Review. The publication helped bring attention to the growing behavioral law and economics field.

Here is a summary of the passage:

The authors presented a paper at a law and economics workshop at the University of Chicago that questioned some of the standard assumptions of traditional law and economics. Specifically, they argued that:

1. People only sometimes have correct beliefs and act rationally as standard theory assumes. For example, they discussed how printing parking tickets on bright orange paper and placing them prominently on car windows might change perceptions and deter illegal parking, even without changing the probability of getting caught.

2. Evolutionary explanations do not rule out behavioral anomalies and the need to modify the standard theory. While some behaviors may have evolutionary origins, that does not make them necessarily rational or consistent with traditional economic theory.

3. The Coase theorem, which says that resources will flow to their highest-valued use without transaction costs, only sometimes holds in practice. The authors presented evidence from experiments showing that trading volume was much lower than predicted when trading coffee mugs due to the endowment effect. People valued items they were given more highly. Thus, how goods were initially allocated impacted who ended up owning them, contrary to the Coase theorem.

4. Some proponents of the traditional Chicago School, like John Lott, made untenable arguments to defend standard theory, like labeling preferences themselves as "transaction costs." But this makes the approach untestable and worthless.

The presentation was very contentious, especially questioning the Coase theorem, but the authors stood their ground while remaining calm. Judge Posner, a proponent of standard law and economics, was initially skeptical but ultimately seemed to acknowledge some of the authors' points.

- The author, behavioral economist Richard Thaler, presented a paper critiquing the rational actor model and the efficient market hypothesis at a workshop at the University of Chicago. The report argued that behavioral factors like sunk cost fallacies, loss aversion, and fairness concerns affect human economic decision making.

- The presentation of the paper caused consternation among proponents of the rational actor model, including economist Merton Miller. Thaler saw Miller angrily questioning people around him during the presentation.

- To demonstrate loss aversion and fairness concerns, the paper presented results from a version of the Ultimatum Game where participants used their money. Proposers behaved similarly to in other versions, but Responders demanded more money, showing loss aversion and fairness concerns with their own money.

- Thaler argues the results undermine the Coase theorem, which assumes rational self-interested behavior. He shares an anecdote about trying to apply the Coase theorem to resolve a dispute with his neighbor over a tree, but his neighbor refused to negotiate.

- The paper also briefly discussed "anti-anti paternalism" - not arguing for paternalism but saying it cannot be ruled out. They noted bureaucrats are also subject to behavioral biases.

- Though the presentation did not convert the participants, it confirmed the paper would be controversial. The behavioral law and economics field it helped launch has since become widely accepted.

- The passage then discusses choosing offices in a new building at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. Though normally research-focused, the faculty focused on picking offices for a few months in the Spring of 2002.

- The deans decided to assign offices through an "office draft" where faculty would pick offices in a predetermined order.

- The deputy dean, John Huizinga, determined the draft order based on his assessment of "merit." The details of how he chose the order were kept secret.

- This led to complaints from senior faculty, who thought they deserved higher picks. One faculty member, "Archie," was angry that others he thought were less deserving received higher picks.

- Before the actual draft, the faculty conducted mock drafts to determine desirable "neighborhoods." This led to conflict when accurate picks differed from the mock draft.

- During the actual draft, one faculty member, Luigi Zingales, discovered the office sizes provided needed to be more accurate. This led to remeasurement, delays, and demands for re-picks.

- John Huizinga announced a re-start of the draft but barred picking offices already selected, angering some.

- The process led to significant distress, anger, and controversy among the faculty.

In summary, we were basing a high-stakes process like office assignment on subjective measures of merit and an opaque system of determining draft orders that needed revision. This led to a chaotic, stressful experience for all involved. When errors and inaccuracies came to light, the ad hoc solution created further issues. The whole experience highlights how such a process could go wrong in multiple ways.

- The author and a former student, Cade Massey, studied decision-making by teams in the National Football League (NFL)
- They were interested in testing Gary Becker's conjecture that behavioral biases disappear in competitive, high-stakes environments.
- Their research focused on the NFL draft, where teams take turns selecting college football players to join their team. Teams with the worst records get the first picks.
- Teams can trade their draft picks, allowing the authors to study how teams value the right to pick earlier. They hypothesized teams would overvalue early picks.
- Five reasons supported their hypothesis:

1. People are overconfident in their ability to evaluate players
2. People make extreme forecasts, saying players are likely to be superstars when they likely won't be.
3. People are overly optimistic, thinking their picks will do better than average.
4. People are loss averse, not wanting to miss out on a potential star.
5. People are prone to the sunk cost fallacy, reluctant to drop players they invested high picks.

- An example was New Orleans Saints coach Mike Ditka trading many picks to get running back Ricky Williams, who didn't transform the team. Ditka was fired.
- The authors found teams generally overvalue the right to pick earlier, consistent with their hypothesis. The findings contradict Becker's conjecture about this environment.

- Ion superstars, or players of exceptional talent, are rare.
- The winner's curse suggests that the winners of an auction often overvalue what they win, and the same applies to teams picking early in the draft. They overvalue the players they pick.
- The false consensus effect means that teams falsely assume other teams share their views on a player, so they hurry to pick the player before another team does.
- Present bias means teams want to win now, so they overvalue players who might help them win immediately.
- An analysis of the market value of draft picks shows that early picks are valued much more highly, even though the ability to identify talent is limited.
- Players picked early in the draft are paid much more, even though their performance could be better.
- Analysis of player performance and pay over initial contracts found that early first-round picks provide less surplus value than later picks.
- In summary, the analysis suggests that the market for draft picks and the high pay for early picks could be more rational and efficient. Teams overvalue early picks and the players taken with them. Exceptional talent is rare, and the ability to identify it is limited, but teams don't act that way.

1. Early draft picks are much more valuable than later picks. According to data, the first pick is worth five times more than an early second-round pick. But in reality, each second-round choice provides more value to a team than a first-round pick. This shows the market for draft picks could be more efficient.

2. Teams often trade draft picks of the current year for next year's choices. The exchange rate usually gives up a selection in a given round this year to get a pick one round earlier next year. This implies teams are discounting the future at an absurdly high rate of 136% per year. Intelligent teams use this by trading current picks for higher future ones.

3. The researchers recommend two strategies: (1) trade down - trade high first-round picks for multiple later picks, especially second-round picks; (2) be a draft-pick banker - lend current picks for higher future picks.

4. Reasons like higher jersey sales, ticket sales, or chance of getting a superstar cannot explain why teams overvalue high first-round picks. Analyses show teams benefit more from trading down.

5. The researchers worked with three NFL teams. Dan Snyder, the owner of the Redskins, was interested but did the opposite of their recommendations. The Redskins traded multiple high picks to move up and draft Robert Griffin III, who got injured and did not play well. In hindsight, it was a very costly move. Another team was more receptive to the researchers' advice.

6. There are often debates about draft strategy within teams. Some staff supports analytics-based methods like the researchers' recommendations, while others do not.

In summary, the analyses clearly show the market for NFL draft picks could be more efficient. Teams can benefit significantly from valuing draft picks based on their value and performance rather than overpaying for high first-round choices. Following recommendations to trade down and gain more valuable future picks is an intelligent strategy.

The author and his coauthor, Cade, analyzed NFL draft data and found that teams must optimize their draft pick selections. Teams often trade up to get particular players they have their eye on ("their guys") rather than trading down to get more, lower picks. Even when teams do trade down, they tend not to maximize the value of the extra choices. The author argues this is an example of "dumb principals"—owners and coaches—rather than a traditional principal-agent problem.

The author cites research showing NFL coaches are too conservative on fourth-down decisions, costing teams up to two-thirds of a win per season. Coaches have kept their behavior unchanged despite research and tools offering optimal strategies. The author argues that coaches want to avoid second-guessing and follow conventional wisdom.

The author questions whether Gary Becker's conjecture—that the top 10% in analytical reasoning end up in jobs where that matters—holds for leadership roles like coaches, department chairs, and CEOs. While competitive markets may channel those with specific skills into the right jobs, leadership roles require various skills. Those in leadership may rely more on intuition than analysis for big decisions.

The author has been working with a team whose owner wants to adopt optimal strategies. However, getting the whole organization on board has been challenging, especially when designs go against conventional wisdom. Success requires the owner's commitment and convincing employees they will be rewarded even when unconventional strategies do not pan out. Understanding how teams and organizations make decisions requires recognizing humans run them.

The author argues more evidence beyond market prices is needed to determine whether behavioral anomalies persist in the real world. He turns to game shows, where the specific choices and behaviors of individuals competing for large prizes can be observed.

The researchers studied contestant behavior on the game show Deal or No Deal. The show presented contestants with choices between a sure monetary amount (the "bank offer") or continuing to the next round, where they could win more or less money. The researchers found that:

1. Contestants were only moderately risk averse, often rejecting sure amounts worth 70% of the expected value in order to continue playing. This contradicts the notion that extreme risk aversion is necessary to explain economic puzzles like the equity premium.

2. Contestant behavior showed "path dependence" - they were influenced not just by the choice in front of them, but by the outcomes that had occurred earlier in the game. Specifically:

- Contestants who felt "behind" because of bad luck in early rounds were risk-seeking, hoping to win big and make up for their losses. For example, Frank rejected a 74% offer after a string of bad luck, then ended up winning only €10.

- Contestants who felt "ahead" because of good luck in early rounds were willing to take risks, playing with "house money." For example, Susanne rejected a 100% offer after a string of good luck, and ended up winning €150,000.

- This path dependence mirrors behavior the researchers had observed before in poker players and in lab experiments with small stakes. But Deal or No Deal allowed them to keep it with enormous stakes.

So in summary, the researchers found evidence contradicting extreme risk aversion and supporting path dependence and the house money effect in high-stakes decisions. The results suggest these behavioral tendencies are robust.

- Researchers studied risk-taking behavior and cooperation in the game show Golden Balls.
- In the final round, the two remaining contestants play a version of the Prisoner's Dilemma with high stakes.
- Contrary to predictions, cooperation rates did not fall dramatically with higher stakes. Cooperation was around 40-50%, similar to low-stakes experiments.
- Cooperation rates only fell for very low stakes, which the researchers call the "big peanuts" hypothesis. Very low stakes seemed trivial in the context of the show.
- The only good predictor of cooperation was if a contestant explicitly promised to split the money. People are more willing to lie by omission than outright promise something false.
- In one memorable episode, a contestant named Nick proposed an unusual strategy. He promised to steal the money but then share it with the other player afterward. The other player, Ibrahim, needed clarification and did not trust Nick's promise.
- The researchers analyzed many variables but found little correlation with cooperation rates, except that young men were less likely to split.
- The speeches given before the decision were cheap talk and not very informative, except for explicit promises to split.

The key findings are:

1. Contrary to traditional economic predictions, cooperation rates remained steady even with very high stakes.

2. The context and relative stakes matter for how people view money. Very low stakes seemed trivial within the context of the usually high stakes.

3. Don't trust the promises of young men.

4. Explicit promises are more credible than vague statements.

5. The unusual strategy of promising to steal but then share the winnings did not prove convincing without a way to guarantee that promise.

Here's a summary:

- The passage describes a T.V. game show episode involving deception and strategy. Two contestants, Nick and Ibrahim, have to choose between two balls, one of which is a "split" ball. Ibrahim initially seems skeptical of Nick's arguments but eventually decides the split ball. However, Nick's prom was also divided, showing that Nick had deceived Ibrahim. In a later interview, Ibrahim reveals that he planned to trick Nick until the last minute. The passage concludes that "people are interesting."

- The author discusses collaborating with others on research. He expresses some hesitations, including his tendency to work slowly and the risk of failing to receive proper credit for ideas. However, he agrees to collaborate on the condition that he can withdraw if he does not think he is contributing.

- The passage describes the development of behavioral economics, including documenting anomalies, developing theory, and aiming to influence policy. Two goals were empirical, finding anomalies, and developing models. A third goal was using insights to improve the world without confirming critics' suspicions.

- The author discusses using behavioral insights to help people save more for retirement. Standard economic theory only provides one tool, the after-tax return, but the impact could be more precise. Behavioral economics offers more tools by considering psychological factors. The author made proposals like allowing people to put tax refunds in IRAs and increasing tax withholding to produce larger refunds, which people tend to save more of.

- The key ideas are that: 1) People can be deceitful and strategic in competitive situations. 2) Collaboration requires the right conditions and partners. 3) Behavioral economics developed to document anomalies, build theory, and influence policy. 4) Standard economics only provides limited tools (after-tax returns) to encourage retirement savings. 5) Behavioral proposals (using tax refunds and withholding) can provide more effective tools by accounting for psychology.

- The author proposed changing the default option for 401(k) plans from opt-in to automatic enrollment. This means employees would be automatically enrolled in the plan at a default savings rate and investment option unless they opted out.

- According to standard economics, default options should not affect behavior because the benefits of joining a 401(k) far outweigh any inconvenience of filling out forms. However, the author believed that defaults could significantly impact humans due to inertia, loss aversion, and present bias.

- The concept of automatic enrollment was familiar but was slow to be adopted. A lawyer named Mark Iwry helped pave the way by issuing rulings stating that automatic enrollment was legal.

- A study by Brigitte Madrian and Dennis Shea proved that automatic enrollment worked. They found that participation in a company's 401(k) plan jumped from 49% to 86% after the company switched to automatic enrollment. Only 14% opted out.

- The government influenced the default options (3% contribution rate and money market fund investment). The 3% rate was mentioned in an example in one of the rulings. The money market fund was the only option approved by the Department of Labor then.

- In summary, although proposed earlier, automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans gained adoption and evidence of effectiveness in the early 2000s thanks to efforts by researchers, policymakers, and companies willing to try new approaches.

- A firm introduced automatic enrollment for retirement savings at a 3% contribution rate. This default choice led many employees to save at 3% even though some would have chosen higher rates if left to choose themselves.

- This shows the downside of defaults—they can anchor people at suboptimal rates. The "Save More Tomorrow" plan helps address this by gradually increasing contributions over time.

- "Save More Tomorrow" was first tested at a firm where employees were saving little and reluctant to increase contributions quickly. 78% of employees enrolled in the plan increased their contribution rates by three percentage points each year. After 3.5 years, their rates had quadrupled from 3.5% to 13.6%.

- Lessons: Ease of enrollment and education are essential to high participation: defaults and automatic escalation help. Over time, many firms and countries have adopted these automatic saving features.

- A Danish data study found that most of the increased savings from automatic plans are new, not reduced, saving elsewhere. Tax incentives had little effect compared to mechanical features.

- In summary, automatic saving features like defaults, automated escalation, and Save More Tomorrow can help people save more for retirement. They work better than tax incentives alone.

- The author presented research findings at a conference where Casey Mulligan, an economist with opposing views, was the discussant.
- Mulligan accused the author of "paternalism," which the author objected to since the program was voluntary. The author suggested "libertarian paternalism" as an alternative.
- The author and Cass Sunstein developed the concept of "libertarian paternalism" further, arguing that policies can help guide people to good choices without restricting freedom of choice.
- They proposed this idea in a paper and then a book titled Nudge, though the publishing industry needed more initial interest. The central argument was that predictable human errors call for choice architectures to steer people gently in good directions.
- While rules and mandates are sometimes necessary, libertarian paternalism explores how far one can go with mere suggestions and default options that can be easily opted out of. The bumpy lane markers that wake up drowsy drivers are an example.
- The approach recognizes human fallibility but respects human agency and autonomy. It aims to help without coercion. Critics argue it is still a form of unwarranted meddling. Still, proponents counter that some choice architecture is inevitable so that we can create architectures aligned with people's true interests.

The key ideas are:

1. Libertarian paternalism: Helping guide choices through suggestions and defaults while preserving freedom of choice.

2. Nudging: The strategies used to implement libertarian paternalism, like choice architectures that channel behavior.

3. Humans vs. Econs: People are subject to biases and errors, unlike the rational agents assumed in economic theory.

4. The approach seeks to help in a non-coercive, autonomy-respecting way by working with, rather than against, human tendencies and quirks. But critics argue it is still an improper influence on choice.

5. While some rules are necessary, libertarian paternalism explores how far choice guidance can extend. But it does not claim that a nudge can solve all problems.

That covers the essence and main takeaways from the summary. Please let me know if you want me to clarify or expand on any summary part.

The authors clarify that they have no intention of telling people what to do. Their goal is to help people achieve what they want for themselves. They define their objective as influencing choices to make people better off as judged by themselves. They use the example of etched flies in Schiphol Airport urinals to nudge men to aim better and reduce spillage.

The authors realized they needed an organizing principle to devise effective nudges. They found inspiration in Don Norman's book The Design of Everyday Things. They adopted the term "choice architecture" to describe designing environments to influence choices. They investigated various policy issues to find opportunities for nudges, abandoning some, like Hurricane Katrina, where they had little to offer.

They initially thought presumed consent was the best policy for organ donation based on research showing the power of defaults. However, they learned that supposed consent countries often still ask family members, causing issues. They prefer "prompted choice," as used in Illinois, where people choose whether to donate when renewing licenses. Prompted choice achieves high donation rates without controversy over the term "mandated choice."

In 2008, the book had just been released in the U.K. Richard Reeves, director of the Demos think tank, invited the author to speak. Reeves asked if the author wanted to meet Conservative Party members interested in nudges. The author met with Rohan Silva, an advisor to Conservative Party leader David Cameron. Silva was interested in nudging to encourage environmentally friendly behavior and civic renewal. The author suggested a "nudge unit" to find nudges, and Cameron created one. The Behavioural Insights Team became independent in 2014 but still works with the U.K. government.

Here's a summary:

The author was skeptical about meeting with Conservatives. He had never been described as conservative before. However, he agreed to meet with Rohan Silva, a young Conservative MP, and some colleagues. To his surprise, they were casually dressed and progressive. They were interested in the ideas of nudging and behavioral economics advocated in the book Nudge, which the author had co-written.

Rohan bought ten copies of Nudge and gave them to colleagues. David Cameron read the book and recommended it to other Conservative M.P.s. The author returned to London and sat beside Sir Gus O'Donnell at an event. O'Donnell was the Cabinet Secretary, the top civil servant in the U.K., and was already interested in behavioral economics.

After the 2010 election, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats formed a coalition government. Rohan and Steve Hilton became policy advisors to Prime Minister David Cameron. O'Donnell and the new policy team wanted to use behavioral insights to improve government. They set up the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT), known as the "nudge unit."

The BIT's mission was to significantly impact policy in at least two areas, spread understanding of behavioral approaches in government, and achieve a tenfold return on investment. The BIT would use behavioral Science to improve government. They identified problems in departments and suggested solutions.

In one early meeting, Nick Down from the tax authority HMRC met with the BIT. HMRC wanted help improving tax collection from self-employed individuals and others with income besides regular wages. The BIT suggested several nudges, like simplifying forms, emphasizing social norms, and restructuring payment plans. HMRC implemented the ideas, and tax revenue increased. The BIT's success with HMRC demonstrated the potential of applying behavioral insights to policy.

Here's a summary:

- Taxpayers in the U.K. have to pay taxes in installments on January 31 and July 31. If they miss the second payment, they receive reminders and can face legal action.
- The tax collection agency (HMRC) wants to improve the effectiveness of the first reminder notice to save money.
- Nick Down from HMRC read research by psychologist Robert Cialdini on how to influence people. Cialdini recommends telling people that most others comply with a norm to encourage compliance.
- HMRC ran a small pilot study using letters telling taxpayers that most pay on time. The results seemed promising but needed more scientific rigor.
- HMRC partnered with the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) to run a sizeable randomized experiment. They sent reminders to 120,000 taxpayers who owed £351 to £50,000.
- The most effective message combined saying most pay on time and that the recipient was in the minority who hadn't paid yet. This increased on-time payments by over five percentage points, bringing in £9 million faster.
- The experiment likely saved enough money to fund the BIT for years.
- Two principles guided the work: (1) Make desired behaviors easy. (2) Use evidence from randomized controlled trials.
- In another study, BIT proposed offering attic insulation deals that included attic cleanup to help address homeowners' objections that their attics were too cluttered.
- A field experiment offered homeowners the insulation deal, the deal plus cheap cleanup help, or the deal plus expensive cleanup help. Only 28 people took an offer, but most took ones with cleanup help, suggesting it could help. However, the small numbers mean more evidence is needed.

- The example of removing barriers to donations illustrates both the potential of behaviorally-informed interventions and the difficulties of conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the field.
- While RCTs are necessary to determine what works, they are expensive, difficult to conduct, and prone to errors and unintended effects. However, not testing ideas before implementing them is also problematic.
- Effects of interventions may appear small (1-2% changes) but can have significant impacts when implemented at a large scale. However, significant effects are rare and often require a targeted population, agreement that change is needed, and a simple "one-click" solution.
- Simple reminders via text can be effective, low-cost interventions. Two examples show increased health regimen compliance in Ghana and increased parental involvement in education in the U.S.
- The U.K.'s Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) received renewed funding and support. It has grown in size and scope, working with various U.K. government departments and other countries.
- In the U.S., Cass Sunstein helped incorporate behavioral insights as head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). More recently, Maya Shankar created the White House Social and Behavioral Sciences Team (SBST), which has already run many RCTs across federal agencies. The SBST received funding and support to continue expanding its work.

The key ideas are:

1. Test simple, behaviorally-informed interventions through RCTs
2. Manage expectations about effect sizes but look for "one-click" solutions and simple reminders
3. Build governmental support and infrastructure for behaviorally-informed policy making, as the U.K. and the U.S. have done.

- The author is proud of the progress of behavioral insights and the spread of its use worldwide. Over 50 countries have incorporated behavioral sciences into policymaking.

- The author prefers "behavioral sciences" over "behavioral economics" since the work draws from psychology and other social sciences, not just economics.

- The author wants behavioral insights to be used for good - to help people and society. Businesses and governments could also use them for their benefit and at the expense of others. Behavioral scientists should carefully evaluate interventions and test them rigorously.

- The author's hometown of Chicago recently started its own behavioral insights team. The author encourages other governments to do the same.

- Behavioral economics has become mainstream, though it took 40 years. The author, once seen as a renegade, is now the American Economic Association president. But economics still has a long way to go to incorporate human behavior.

- Behavioral finance has been the most successful application of behavioral economics. It focuses on data and evidence, debating rational and behavioral camps. The facts clearly contradict the sensible, efficient market hypothesis.

- The author wants to see "evidence-based economics" spread to other areas of economics. Most economic theory is based on rational choice axioms rather than evidence. Evidence-based economics can lead to new theories as anomalies are discovered.

- Finance shows how evidence-based economics can work. Theories like the efficient market hypothesis have been scrutinized and found lacking. We now know more about how and why prices can diverge from intrinsic value. Evidence-based finance still has a long way to go, but progress is being made.

- The author wants to see evidence-based economics applied to labor and development economics. New data and methods could test existing theories and find where they fail, leading to new insights. But change will be slow.

- Behavioral approaches have had little impact on macroeconomics so far. Macro issues like monetary and fiscal policy are essential but need a behavioral understanding of humans.

- Keynes practiced behavioral macroeconomics, but that approach died out. George Akerlof and Robert Shiller tried to revive it but struggled to find enough research. In contrast, behavioral finance thrives.

-Behavioral macro lacks falsifiable theories and data that behavioral finance has, like "smoking gun" evidence. So there needs to be more consensus on policy responses to crises. Keynesians support stimulus; others support austerity. Randomized trials are unlikely.

- Still, behavioral economics can provide nuance. For tax cuts, behavioral analysis shows lump sum cuts are more likely saved, but spreads may stimulate spending. For firms, we need to know how they'd use repatriated money - invest, return to shareholders, or hoard.

- For entrepreneurs, behavioral analysis suggests mitigating failure risks may work better than tax cuts since losses loom larger. Comedian Jon Stewart said, "a softer cushion for failure."

- More evidence-based economics, theoretical or empirical, is needed. Prospect theory is seminal. Kahneman and Tversky used data to build an approach. Successors do the same.

- As in development economics, randomized control trials provide new facts to build theory. They show incentives are only sometimes crucial, as economics often assumes.

- In education, field experiments show nuance. Rewarding student inputs like homework may work better than rewarding just outputs like grades. Students who struggle need help to learn how to improve.

Here's a summary:

- A team of researchers found that offering teachers a bonus at the beginning of the school year that must be returned if goals are not met is more effective in improving student performance than offering an end-of-year bonus.

- Sending text message reminders to parents about an upcoming math test improved student performance, especially for lower-performing students. This shows that nudges do not have to be secretive to be effective.

- Public schools and developing countries are challenging but essential environments for experimentation. More experiments are needed to figure out how to improve education. The same is likely true for corporations and other institutions.

- Three lessons from behavioral economics:

1. Observe the world as it is, not as you wish. Notice the mistakes and irrational behaviors that people exhibit.

2. Collect data. Anecdotes are not enough. Data, especially data that can prove you wrong, is needed to overcome overconfidence and confirmation bias. Organizations need to learn how to learn from data.

3. Speak up when you notice a problem. Subordinates need to feel empowered to warn leaders about impending disasters. Leaders must create environments where speaking up is rewarded.

- Economics is becoming more open to behavioral insights. Promising signs include economists publishing behavioral papers and recognizing the importance of psychology and choice architecture. Behavioral economics may eventually disappear as all economics becomes open to human behavior. But some economists still cling to unrealistic assumptions of rationality.

- Examples of speaking up potentially preventing disaster include a plane crash that killed 500 people and climbing deaths on Mount Everest. In both cases, subordinates failed to question the judgments of leaders.

- The author took a risky career path in speaking up about the unrealism of economic rational models but was uniquely positioned to do so. Taking risks and speaking up can be worthwhile when the opportunity costs are low. But leaders must create supportive environments.
