 Here's a summary of the ABOUT THE AUTHOR section:

- Steven Bartlett is a 28-year-old entrepreneur and the founder of Social Chain, a social media marketing agency. 
- He grew up poor in Botswana and England. He dropped out of university at 18. 
- At 21, he founded Social Chain from his bedroom. The company is now valued at nearly $200 million.
- Bartlett is considered one of the most accomplished young entrepreneurs in Europe. He has over 2 million social media followers.  
- This book shares his life lessons on finding fulfillment, love and success. He aims to counter popular but misguided advice and "suck the bullshit" from societal brainwashing. 
- When Bartlett says "happy," he means a feeling of internal fulfillment, not just a good mood. When he says "sexy," he means finding love and romance. When he says "millionaire," he means achieving a subjective level of success and accomplishing one's aims.



The author grew up in a poor family with an eccentric Nigerian mother and a submissive English father. They lived in a dilapidated house in a middle-class neighborhood in rural England. The author attended a predominantly white middle-class school and tried to hide his family's poverty from his peers out of embarrassment. He announced at 14 that he would become a millionaire, thinking it would make him happy and help him win over his crush. 

At 18, he left home with little money, determined to become a "happy, sexy millionaire." Seven years later, he had achieved his goal as the 25-year-old CEO of a $200 million public company. However, he did not feel any happier. He realized he had been lied to by society's narrative that money and success equal happiness. In truth, he had always been happy, even when he was poor. He learned that happiness is an infinite game you can't win - you can only experience it. As long as you think happiness is somewhere in the future, like in a new relationship, job, or achievement, you'll never find it in the present.

The key lessons are:

1) Happiness comes from within, not from external success or material gain. 
2) Happiness is an infinite game you can't win; you can only experience it in the present. 
3) As long as you believe happiness is somewhere in the future, you'll never find it in the now.
4) Let go of the idea that there is a "destination" or finish line for happiness. All that matters is the present moment.



- Happiness is found in the present moment, not in chasing destinations or milestones. As Lao Tzu said, ‘a good traveller has no fixed plans and is not intent on arriving’.

- We have been wrongly convinced that we need external things like promotions, money, relationships, social media likes, etc. to be happy. But happiness comes from within, from self-worth and feeling enough. 

- Social media encourages status games and social comparisons that make us feel inadequate and like we need more. But these are zero-sum games that take happiness from others.

- There is a crisis of meaning in society as people trade meaning for superficial measures of success. This is damaging wellbeing and even lifespans.

- Our brains make most decisions unconsciously and irrationally based on instincts and mental shortcuts. We are not in control of our thinking and judgements as much as we believe. 

- One way our brain makes quick judgements is through contrast and relativity - comparing one thing to another. This was useful for survival but leads to poor decision making and happiness in modern life.

- The perceived value and desirability of things depends greatly on what else is available for comparison. Our brains attribute value based on contrast, not inherent worth. 

- An example is how mobile phones have changed. A basic phone from years ago seems embarrassing now only because far superior options exist, not because the phone itself has changed. But its inherent capabilities are the same.

- We need to be aware of how our brain uses contrast and relativity so we are not misled in our thinking and decision making. We must focus on what really matters for wellbeing rather than chase shifting values.



- The human brain naturally makes comparisons and judgments relative to the context in which information is presented. This “mental CEO” evolved to make quick decisions that favored survival, but now leads to irrational judgments and perceptions of inferiority when bombarded by curated images of seemingly perfect lives on social media.

- The value we attribute to things depends entirely on the context and circumstances. Gold has tremendous value to humans but none to other species. As a child, the author felt inferior by comparing his life to his wealthier neighbors, even though he would have felt “enough” if born in a poor village. 

- You can’t stop comparing yourself to others, but you can take actions to avoid negative comparisons. Following “fake influencers” who curate unrealistic versions of their lives is “mental self-harm.” Over 1/3 of cosmetic surgery patients want to look like social media influencers. Instagram was rated worst for mental health due to toxic comparisons.

- Kylie Jenner exemplifies this issue. She has 300m+ followers, broadcasts an unrealistic curated life, and has struggled with her mental health as a result. Her fans compare themselves to her fake, filtered image. The author is sympathetic but says followers must stop this “voluntary mental self-harm.”

- Your “lazy CEO mind” persistently makes comparisons, so “stop comparing yourself” is useless advice. Upward comparisons to celebrities or successful friends make us feel inferior. The key is making the right comparisons - to your past self, not unrealistic images. Focus inward, not upward.

The key message is that while comparison is human nature, social media bombards us with curated images that fuel negative upward comparisons and perceptions of inferiority. The solution is focusing inward, limiting consumption of unrealistic influencers, and comparing yourself to your past self, not filtered lives. Make the right comparisons.



• Comparing yourself to people who are more successful or privileged than you (upward social comparisons) is unhealthy and unfair. Each person has a unique set of life circumstances, strengths, and weaknesses. 

• Constant upward social comparisons foster feelings of inferiority, helplessness, and burnout. They are detrimental to well-being and self-esteem.

• Downward social comparisons, comparing yourself to those less fortunate, can temporarily boost self-esteem but the effects are short-lived. 

• Social media has normalized distorted images of perfection, making “good” seem disposable. Unfollow accounts that promote unhealthy social comparisons.

• At 18, the author was homeless and living in poverty. Finding £13.40 in loose change one day made him happier than becoming a multi-millionaire years later. 

• Upon becoming very wealthy, the author and his business partner felt numb. Retrospectively reflecting on their difficult past and expressing gratitude for their present circumstances generated feelings of euphoria and joy.

• Gratitude is one of the most powerful tools for increasing happiness and well-being. It releases dopamine, the “feel-good” neurotransmitter. However, gratitude must be consciously practiced to be effective. We are focused on the future and what we lack, rarely noticing what we have.

• The author did not feel automatically happy about his financial success because his mind was already making unhealthy upward comparisons that diminished his sense of accomplishment. Gratitude provided much-needed perspective.

• In summary, avoid unhealthy social comparisons, follow inspiring social media accounts, and regularly practice gratitude. Appreciate what you have by reflecting on how far you've come. This can help generate optimism, joy, and resilience. Your circumstances do not determine your happiness and well-being. Your mindset and practices do.



- The human mind has a tendency to constantly compare itself to others, especially with the rise of social media. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and never feeling satisfied. 
- Research shows that people determine life satisfaction based on two questions: Am I doing better than I was before? And am I doing better than other people? This applies to wealth, status, attractiveness, and other metrics. 
- However, many of the things that really matter in life like relationships are hard to measure and compare. So people turn to quantifiable measures like money, followers, job titles, house size, etc. But satisfaction from these things is fleeting. 
- Studies show that no matter how much money people have, they always feel they need more to be happy. Happiness seems always in the future, never in the present. 
- Maslow’s hierarchy of needs shows that lower-level needs like survival must be met before higher-level needs like esteem and self-actualization drive motivation. Once needs are met, more money does not increase happiness. 
- Research found that life satisfaction plateaus at an income of around $95,000 USD. More money beyond that does not increase well-being. 
- The author decided to start a gratitude habit to shift his mindset. He noticed writing down things he was grateful for led to feeling more fulfilled and less materialistic. 
- Studies show gratitude decreases materialism and increases charitable donations. During the pandemic, gratitude and downward social comparisons seemed to decrease materialism as people focused on what really mattered.

The key takeaway is that happiness comes from within, not from comparing yourself to others or chasing external rewards. A simple gratitude practice can help shift your mindset to appreciate what you have.



- The author argues that the socially propagated idea of how our lives are “supposed” to go according to a prescribed timeline and set of milestones is damaging and unrealistic. Life is chaotic and uncertain. 

- We incorrectly think that achieving our goals will lead to stability and satisfaction. In reality, achieving goals often leads to feelings of purposelessness and unhappiness. The act of striving for goals, despite discomfort, provides stability. Happiness comes from the pursuit of happiness itself, not the achievement of milestones.

- The ancient Greek Stoic philosophers taught that the two things in life worth pursuing were virtue (living a happy life) and tranquility (an ongoing state of freedom from distress). They recognized humanity’s tendency toward insatiable desire for more. 

- The author suggests focusing on living according to your values and priorities rather than societal expectations. Find purpose and meaning through acts of creation and service. Build strong relationships. Practice gratitude and mindfulness. Happiness comes from within, not from material gains or status.

- There are many paths to a happy, meaningful life. Do not judge yourself or others for diverging from arbitrary societal timelines or expectations. Focus on your own journey.

The key ideas are: reject unrealistic societal expectations, find purpose and meaning through living according to your values, build strong relationships, focus on experiences over material gains, and understand that there are many paths to a happy life. The pursuit of happiness, not the achievement of milestones, provides the most fulfillment.



The author argues that many of the questions and phrases commonly used in self-help and motivational contexts are invalid, toxic and anxiety-inducing. Questions like ‘What’s your passion?’, ‘Have you found your purpose?’ and ‘Is this your soulmate?’ presume that life and human experiences can be reduced to simple binary choices. But human beings are complex, multifaceted and unique. These types of loaded questions cause people to question themselves unnecessarily and feel inadequate if their experiences don’t fit into these binary boxes. 

The author points out that sexuality and gender, for example, were wrongly viewed as binary for a long time - and this caused immense harm, anxiety, depression and even suicide for people who didn’t fit into these boxes. Forcing complex human experiences into binary choices is invalid and causes damage. 

Life is imperfect and complex, not binary. Human beings have 7 billion atoms, 37 trillion cells and millions of individual experiences that shape their perspectives. We feel, see and think in profoundly different ways. So questions that presume simple yes or no answers fail to grasp the nuance and complexity of human existence.

The author argues these types of binary questions and statements - though perhaps well-intentioned - have caused more people to feel lost and question themselves unnecessarily. They make a perfectly happy person feel as though they shouldn’t be, just because their experiences don’t align with an unrealistic binary view of life. The author urges us to reject these types of toxic, loaded questions and the binary thinking they represent. Life is complex, not binary.

In summary, the key ideas are:

1) Many popular self-help questions are invalid, toxic and anxiety-inducing because they represent a binary view of human experiences which are actually profoundly complex and unique to each individual. 

2) Forcing complex human experiences into binary boxes causes harm, anxiety and discomfort. We must reject this type of simplistic, binary thinking.

3) Life is imperfect, complex and nuanced - not binary. Each human being has a completely unique perspective shaped by their individual experiences, thoughts and feelings.

4) Loaded, binary questions that presume simple yes or no answers fail to grasp the complexity of life and human existence. They make people question themselves unnecessarily and feel inadequate when their experiences don’t fit into unrealistic binary boxes.

5) Though perhaps well-intentioned, these types of binary questions and statements have caused more harm than good by making people feel lost, anxious and as though they shouldn’t be happy with their complex, nuanced experiences.



- Life has no set script or predetermined path. Society promotes an idea of perfection and binary choices that does not match reality. 
- Research shows the idea of having one fixed "passion" is harmful and people are more likely to quit when times get tough. In reality, people have multiple evolving interests.
- Phrases like "your soulmate", "your passion" or "your calling" imply there is one predestined path, which is toxic and unrealistic. 
- People have different definitions of complex ideas like "love". Forcing experiences into binary boxes to match societal expectations often does more harm than good. 
- Marriage is not for everyone. You can have commitment, kids, rings, etc. without marriage. For some marriage improves happiness but for others it does not. 
- To be happy and successful, reject societal expectations and write your own rules based on your own needs and the current world. 
- Research shows "finding your passion" does not necessarily lead to success, income, challenge, progress or fulfillment. Growing up, the author had various interests but found job satisfaction in something unexpected. 
- The usual approaches to finding your "dream job" like making lists of what you enjoy are flawed. People are bad at predicting and remembering what really makes them happy. 
- Judging an experience primarily based on its ending rather than the whole experience is a confounding part of human psychology.

In summary, reject unrealistic societal pressures, be flexible in your thinking, and create your own path to purpose and passion. Do not rely on predetermined formulas. Look for fulfillment in unexpected places.



- Money and stress are complex issues that are often oversimplified. While excess money or stress can be harmful, both in moderation can also lead to satisfaction and motivation. The key is finding the right balance for you.

- Simple answers and 'secrets' to complex life questions do not exist. Developing a successful and fulfilling career takes hard work, persistence,  and patience over a long period of time. There are no shortcuts. 

- The five key ingredients to a dream job are:

1. Engaging work: Work that pulls you in and interests you. This is determined by factors like the freedom to decide how you work, clear tasks, variety, and feedback. 

2. Work that helps others: Doing work that has a positive impact on other people leads to greater happiness and life satisfaction. This could be direct charitable work but also just providing value to clients, customers, or colleagues.

3. Autonomy: Having control over how you do your work and flexibility in your schedule. Feeling trusted to work independently.

4. Mastering challenges: Continuously improving your skills and achieving new levels of mastery in your work. Growth and progress are deeply motivating.

5. Purpose and meaning: Feeling like the work you do matters and contributes value to something greater than yourself. 

- Trying to become your idols or emulate famous entrepreneurs and change the world is misguided. True success and originality come from developing your own unique path, vision, and talents. Focus on becoming the best version of yourself, not an impersonation of someone else.

- Celebrate what makes you different rather than trying to conform to societal standards of success or curate a false image on social media. Your own life and talents are enough.



- The author feels at peace in nature and that it's where humans inherently belong. Our senses tell us nature is 'home'.

- However, most people live in cities, spending 11 hours a day looking at screens in concrete boxes, often alone. This is not a natural human way to live. 

- 12,000 years ago, humans lived in tribes and hunted for food. Now, we often live alone and order food via technology. This shows how far we've strayed from our natural human existence.

- We are increasingly lonely, spend little time in nature, and are very inactive. We focus on meeting our physical needs but ignore our psychological needs like community, connection, and meaning.

- Unmet psychological needs lead to loneliness, anxiety and depression. We label people as 'broken' or 'crazy' instead of recognizing we've created an unnatural human existence. 

- Most 'new age' wellness techniques are based on how humans lived thousands of years ago. We took a 'wrong turn' in how we live now that is detrimental to well-being.

- The summary suggests we need to return to more natural human ways of living to thrive psychologically and emotionally. Our modern lifestyles do not fulfill core human needs.



The author argues that modern life has led to loneliness and isolation. People are overstimulated yet undernourished 
from poor diets and lack of social interaction.

Loneliness has reached epidemic levels, especially for younger and older generations. Nearly half of people surveyed 
feel alone or that their relationships lack meaning. 20% said they have no one to talk to.

The UK appointed the world's first Minister for Loneliness to address this issue. The government strategy includes 
"social prescribing" where doctors refer lonely people to specialists to create social activity plans. However, the author argues this treats the symptoms, not the underlying causes in society.

The author notes that humans evolved to live in tribes and social groups. Isolating from this natural state causes harm, as evidenced in studies of captive chimpanzees, monkeys, and humans. Solitary confinement causes severe psychological distress and even psychosis. 

The author describes his own experience isolating himself while building companies. He was motivated by "hustle porn" on social media that glorified extreme work at the expense of health and relationships. He looked down on those with more balanced lives. He now realizes this mindset was misguided and insecure.

In summary, the key arguments are:

1) Modern life has led to an epidemic of loneliness and isolation that harms wellbeing. 

2) Humans evolved as social creatures and fare poorly in isolation. Evidence shows isolation causes psychological distress across species.

3) Social strategies to address loneliness may treat symptoms but not the root causes in society and culture. 

4) A mindset glorifying work over relationships and health is misguided and can fuel loneliness and isolation. Connecting to others in balanced, meaningful ways is important for wellbeing.



The author unexpectedly resigned as CEO of Social Chain, a large social media company he founded at age 20 and built into a highly successful business. Though the company was thriving by all metrics, he felt leaving was the right choice for him. 

The author has a framework he uses to determine when quitting a role, job or situation is the smart choice. He believes quitting is a skill and that knowing when to quit something that no longer serves you is key to finding fulfillment and success in life. However, quitting is difficult because of the pull to stay in familiar situations.

The author's quitting framework is:

1. Am I learning and growing? If not, it may be time to quit. Life is short and continual learning and growth are key.

2. Do I have passion and purpose? If you've lost your passion or sense of purpose in a role, that is a sign it's time to move on. 

3. Am I happy and fulfilled? If you're not finding happiness and fulfillment, make a change. Staying in an unfulfilling situation leads to resentment, health issues and relationship problems.

4. What opportunities am I missing by staying here? There are opportunity costs to staying stagnant in one place. Consider what else is out there that could be a better use of your time and talents.

5. What will I regret not pursuing? Think about your dreams and goals and whether you'll regret not actively chasing them. If so, it's probably time to quit your current situation.

6. Am I helping others reach their potential? If you're not able to help others because you're no longer growing yourself, it's best for all involved if you move on.

7. What have I outgrown? We all outgrow roles, relationships and environments that no longer serve us or match where we are in our journey. Pay attention to what you have outgrown and be willing to quit it.

In summary, the author believes that while quitting a stable or familiar situation can be difficult, knowing when to quit in pursuit of learning, growth, purpose and fulfillment is a life skill that can lead to greater long-term happiness and success. The quitting framework provides signs that it's time for a change.



The author has a habit of quitting things that are not fulfilling or meaningful. Although this has led to uncertainty at times, it has always led to greater happiness, love and success. The author believes that dealing with uncertainty and difficulty leads to growth and a better life in the long run. 

The author provides the example of Costa Rican spider monkeys to illustrate embracing uncertainty. The monkeys have to leap between trees, letting go of one branch before grasping the next. If they didn’t take these leaps into uncertainty, they wouldn’t be able to move fast enough to survive. Similarly, humans have to navigate uncertainty to find greater fulfillment and happiness.

Studies show that as choices become more uncertain, the brain shifts control to the emotional center, generating fear and anxiety. Successful people are able to override this reaction and think rationally, displaying emotional intelligence. The author spoke with former President Obama, who said that only the most difficult problems that others couldn’t solve landed on his desk. Obama acknowledged that no decision would be perfect, but leaders have to be comfortable with uncertainty and imperfect choices.

The key message is that while uncertainty can provoke fear, embracing it and persevering leads to greater rewards and a better life. Avoiding uncertainty to seek comfort often results in being stuck in unhappy situations. With courage and emotional intelligence, people can navigate uncertainty to find more fulfilling opportunities.

 Here's a summary:

- The author received a message saying his ex-girlfriend had been with someone else shortly after they broke up. 
- This triggered an intense emotional reaction in him and his ego started plotting revenge. However, his rational 'reason' also reminded him that he had hurt her by ending things, and she was within her rights to see other people.
- He went for a run to try and calm down but ended up returning home still consumed with anger and vengeance. 
- His friend called and reiterated the voice of reason - that the girl really liked him, and was probably just trying to move on after he had rejected her. 
- This reminder that she didn't reject him, he rejected her, helped his ego subside and his reason to regain control. By the next morning, he no longer felt the need to retaliate.  
- He reflected that rejection harms us primarily through the stories we tell ourselves about what it means about us, rather than the act itself. Rejection is an assault on our self-esteem, making us feel not good enough. 
- How much rejection impacts us depends on our existing level of self-esteem. His relatively high self-esteem meant reason eventually triumphed, but for those with low self-esteem, the damage can be devastating. 
- He likens it to being the pilot of a plane that gets hijacked by emotional terrorists who take over control, bent on destruction. The key is regaining control of the plane.

The key message is that when facing rejection or emotional provocation, the battle is between reason and ego. For healthy self-esteem and good decisions, reason must triumph. But this requires awareness of the stories we tell ourselves, and a willingness to challenge our ego. 



- The author and his business partner, Dom, were on their way to a team building event when Dom called the author to tell him to check his email. 
- The author found an email in Dom's sent folder to their potential investor, Sebastien, that was very insulting. However, Dom insisted he did not send the email. The author believed Dom.
- The author then received another call from Dom saying there were more emails. The author found that their biggest client had received an insulting email from Dom's account and cancelled their contract. 
- The author then checked his own email and found two more big clients had received insulting emails from Dom's account and wanted to cancel their contracts.
- The author realized their email server had been hacked. He told the team to return to the office to deal with the situation. 
- The author and Dom worked to secure their servers and assess the scale of the attack. The author calmly announced the situation to the team to avoid worrying them.
- Over 20 major clients contacted them, furious about the emails.

The key events are:

1) Dom's email was hacked and used to send insulting emails to their potential investor, biggest client, and two other major clients.
2) The author and Dom worked quickly to secure their systems and determine the scale of the hacking. 
3) The author calmly told the team about the situation to avoid panicking them.
4) Many major clients were outraged by the emails and wanted to cancel their contracts.

The author showed leadership in responding quickly to a crisis, securing their systems, informing the team in a composed manner, and beginning to do damage control with clients. The hacking had the potential to seriously damage their business, but the author's effective response helped limit the harm.

 Here's a summary:

- The company was devastated after a hacker sent malicious emails from the CEO's account to clients and partners. 
- Most long-standing clients didn't believe the CEO's claim that his account was hacked. They canceled their contracts and partnerships. 
- The CEO maintained a calm and composed demeanor to reassure his employees. But privately, he knew the situation was dire, with most clients leaving and potential investor pulling out.  
- The CEO relied on logical, rational thinking to solve the problem. He didn't dwell on emotions like anger or self-pity, seeing them as distractions. His focus was on damage control and fixing the issue.
- The CEO took responsibility for the situation, acknowledging their weak email security and lack of data protection measures. He sincerely apologized to all clients who received the malicious emails. 
- The company lost 80% of clients. Some left not believing the hack, others due to lack of trust in their security. The remaining team was devastated. 
- The CEO worked to rally and motivate the team. He secured an investment to avoid layoffs. He and the co-founder didn't pay themselves for a while.  
- The CEO sees two types of people in chaos: those who panic and worsen the situation, and those who remain focused on solutions. He's the latter, and promotes leaders with that mindset.  
- With optimism, proactivity and focus, the team rebounded. Sales climbed and they landed a multi-million investment, securing the company's future. 
- The CEO believes their reaction to the chaos and hack was pivotal. While bad things happen, your mindset and response determine the impact. Optimism, action and focus saved the company.

In summary, the key message is that in times of crisis, your reaction and mindset are most important in overcoming challenges. Panicking and dwelling on problems will only make the situation worse. Maintaining optimism, focus and taking action are what navigate you to solutions.

 Here's a summary:

- The author recently reached 1 million followers on Instagram. When asked for tips, his instinct is to provide "easy hacks" but his success was really due to consistency over time. 

- Consistency over time is profound but underrated. It's the common factor in the success of everyone the author has met, though invisible. Success is simple in hindsight but was really hard. 

- Warren Buffett attributes his success to compound interest. Compound interest is earning interest on your interest. It's a powerful but neglected force. Einstein called it the "8th wonder of the world."

- Two examples show the power of compounding interest and time. Pablo invests $20K per year at 15% interest for 30 years and becomes a millionaire. The author invests $20K per year for 20 years in the same account but starts 10 years later and ends up with much less. Starting early and giving momentum time to build is key. 

- Success in all areas compounds in the same way. It's slow then sudden. The author's Instagram growth is an example. His first 800 posts got 10K followers, his next 800 posts got 1M more. The growth was compounding from day 1.

- "Invisible PR" refers to small actions that build your reputation, for better or worse, in the minds of others without you realizing. The author saw this as CEO. Small actions of integrity and kindness compounded to help some get promoted. Small negative actions stalled others. Your reputation is built from the stories others tell about you in their minds.

- In summary, consistency over time through small actions is the key to compounding success, momentum, reputation, and growth in all areas of life. It's profound but invisible, and starting as early as possible is key.



- The author tells a story about his assistant, Sophie, who announces her intention to start going to the gym and eat healthier every Monday but never actually follows through. This has gone on for four years. 

- The author initially offered support by offering to pay for a personal trainer and going to the gym with her. But she still did not establish the habit and follow through.

- The author says that Sophie's lack of follow-through is common, citing research that 92% of people never achieve their goals. Sophie and others make excuses like being too tired or lacking willpower.

- The author argues that while small, good habits are easy to do, they are also easy not to do. The rewards of good habits are often delayed, so people lack the motivation to push through and stay consistent. 

- The author tells Sophie not to announce her gym goals to him anymore on Mondays because her lack of follow-through shows she does not really mean it. He says intention and commitment must be demonstrated through action and consistency.

- The key message is that consistency and follow-through are what determine success in life, not good intentions or dramatic short-term efforts. Small good habits compounded over time are what shape our lives, health, relationships, and careers.

So in summary, the author is using Sophie's story as an example to illustrate why consistency and follow-through are so critical to success and progress in life. Good intentions and big announcements do not matter without action and habit. Small good habits, as unimpressive as they seem, are what truly determine our success and shape our lives over the long run.

 Here's a summary:

- Doing the small, inconsistent things, like going to the gym, is easy to overlook but important for achieving long-term goals. 
- Telling yourself you lack "willpower" or are "unmotivated" is an oversimplification that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
- Research shows willpower depletion only exists for those who believe their willpower depletes. Those who believe willpower is unlimited do not experience depletion.
- Labels are oversimplified descriptions we give ourselves that limit us and cause us to act according to those labels. It's hard to change labels without consistent evidence that contradicts them.
- The author gives the example of his friend Ashley who lacked confidence and work but ended up becoming CEO of his own company by rejecting his circumstances and labels. 
- Self-belief isn't easy to develop and requires exposing yourself to evidence that challenges your existing beliefs. Words alone are not enough.
- The author's assistant Sophie struggles to do what she wants not just due to believing in willpower depletion but also due to not actually wanting the goal itself enough. She just wants to want it.

The key takeaways are:

1) Avoid oversimplifying yourself with limiting labels and stories. Expose yourself to evidence that contradicts them.

2) Willpower depletion is a myth that becomes reality only if you believe in it. Believe your willpower is unlimited.

3) Doing small consistent actions is key to achieving big long-term goals. Don't make excuses about lack of willpower or motivation.

4) Truly wanting a goal and not just wanting to want a goal is necessary for following through. Examine if you actually want it.  

5) Provide opportunities for others based on their potential, not their circumstances or labels. Help them build new beliefs and labels through experience.



- The author's friend Sophie wants to go to the gym but psychological barriers are preventing her. 
- According to Nir Eyal, our choices are driven by a desire to avoid discomfort, not seek pleasure. We make excuses to escape discomfort.
- Sophie's discomfort comes from self-esteem and confidence issues. Simply telling her to go to the gym won't work; she needs to address her limiting beliefs.  
- Intentions mean nothing without action. Progress happens when intentions and actions align. 
- We often don't understand our own behaviors and the root causes. Journaling and therapy can help gain self-awareness. 
- Subconscious forces shape us more than advice or information. We have to understand these forces to overcome limiting beliefs.
- The author pursued a girl named Jasmine for years but panicked when she was available. This pattern repeated until he was 23.
- The author's loud, chaotic mother contributed to this pattern. He associated relationships with discomfort and drama. 
- At 23, the author confronted his fear of relationships and committed to overcoming it. He had to reframe what he associated relationships with.

The key points are:

1) Psychological barriers stemming from limiting beliefs and past experiences often prevent progress.
2) Gaining self-awareness through reflection and introspection is key to overcoming these barriers. 
3) Our choices and behaviors are driven by a desire to avoid discomfort, not seek pleasure. We have to address the root causes of the discomfort.
4) Intentions don't lead to change; aligning intentions and actions does.
5) Past experiences, especially in childhood, shape our associations and patterns of behavior in powerful, subconscious ways. We have to reframe these associations to change.



The author's content executive, Adam, was in a bad mood because a client in New York did not pay their invoice on time for the third month in a row. Adam kept saying "The client pissed me off by not paying the invoice" to explain why he was upset. The author pointed out that phrasing things this way mitigates personal responsibility for one's emotions. 

The author asked Adam to explain the situation. Adam said that because the client did not pay, he could not book a vacation, which would upset his girlfriend, strain their relationship, force him to move out, and make him move back in with his parents. The author told Adam to stop and show the invoices. Upon reviewing them, the author found several issues: no due date specified, unprofessional formatting, and ambiguous language. The author helped Adam create a new, professional invoice template with a clear due date and late fees.

Three months later, Adam emailed the author to say that since revising the invoices, the client has paid on time. He thanked the author for fixing the "invoice situation."

The key takeaway is that blaming external factors for your emotions or problems mitigates personal responsibility. It is better to take responsibility for your reactions and look for solutions within your control. In this case, improving the clarity, professionalism, and terms of the invoices resolved the late payment issues, even though Adam had blamed the client. Our responses are within our control, so we should not make others "make us" feel or act in certain ways. We are responsible for managing our emotions and addressing issues we can control.

 Here is a one-word summary:

Responsibility.

 Here's a summary:

- The author doesn't have a strict routine and sleep schedule. He sometimes eats healthy and sometimes eats poorly. He procrastinates, gets distracted, and wastes time online. Most successful people are actually like this, not highly motivated all the time.

- Motivation comes from within (intrinsic) or from external rewards (extrinsic). Many people pursue extrinsic goals like money or status because of pressure from society and social media. But intrinsic goals lead to more happiness and fulfillment. 

- You should examine your goals and make sure they are really what you want, not what others want for you. Pursuing extrinsic goals often leads to regret and burnout. The dying often regret not living according to their own desires.

- Burnout is often caused by relentlessly pursuing extrinsic goals for extrinsic rewards, like working a job you don't enjoy just for the money. Burnout is less likely when you do things you find intrinsically motivating.

- As a student, the author found the education system boring and unmotivating. He felt trapped, just waiting for the freedom of the bell.

- In summary, you should pursue goals that motivate you intrinsically, not just for external rewards or to please others. This will lead to less regret, more happiness, and less risk of burnout. Know the difference between what you really want and what others want for you.



The author was not intrinsically motivated to attend school and do homework, resulting in poor grades. However, between ages 18 and 25, he became very hardworking and built a successful marketing company. He realized he was never inherently lazy, he just lacked intrinsic motivation for things that did not interest him. When aligned with his passions, he was extremely hardworking and consistent. 

The author argues that people do not actually want money, fame or status itself. They want the feelings they believe those things will bring, such as happiness. Happiness actually comes from intrinsic things like relationships, purpose, and passion. Focusing on intrinsically motivating goals also enables consistency, avoids burnout, and leads to mastery. The only way to become great is by pursuing your own passions and living authentically.

If you are paid to do something you love, you will lose some intrinsic motivation for it. Psychologists call this the “undermining effect.” Two types of motivation are intrinsic (internal) and extrinsic (external). While both influence behavior, intrinsic motivation satisfies the needs for autonomy, competence, and connection. Continual negative feedback reduces intrinsic motivation by undermining feelings of competence and autonomy.

The author shares an example of becoming unmotivated to take photos of his ex-girlfriend for her Instagram modeling. At first, he enjoyed helping her, but after receiving continual negative feedback about his photos, he began to dread the task and feel incompetent. This killed his intrinsic motivation. For high intrinsic motivation, both competence and autonomy must be present. His ex-girlfriend’s micromanagement and criticism undermined both, causing him to lose motivation. Positive, constructive feedback and autonomy, on the other hand, enhances intrinsic motivation.

In summary, focus on your intrinsic passions and motivations. Be aware of how external rewards and feedback can undermine motivation. Provide positive, constructive feedback to others to enhance their motivation and feelings of competence. Autonomy and independence are also key.



- People are commonly motivated by external rewards like money or approval. However, relying on external motivation reduces your sense of autonomy and control. Those with an internal sense of motivation, responsibility and control tend to be the most self-determined and motivated.

- The student example illustrates the difference between internal and external motivation. The internally motivated student takes responsibility for their failure and develops a plan to improve. The externally motivated student blames others and sees themselves as a victim. 

- Skill stacking, or being very good at a variety of complementary skills, is more valuable than being the best at any single skill. This is illustrated through examples of the world's best photographer and the author's experience as a leader in social media marketing.

- To become the best in your industry, focus on developing a skill stack - become very good at 6-7 complementary skills required for success in your industry. Specific knowledge is less valuable in the long run because it decays quickly and is less transferable. Fundamental skills are most valuable.

- Access to information is valuable because it can provide skills and opportunities for a lifetime. Most people don't understand the true power of information. 

- Love, good leadership and true friendship do not seek to control or dominate others. Insecurity does.



- Humans have a limited lifespan, around 500,000 active hours if living to 80 years old 
- These hours are irreplaceable and like gambling chips that must be placed each hour
- How we spend these chips determines our outcomes and success in life
- Most people don't seem to truly understand that time is limited and will run out
- It's uncomfortable for many to accept the reality of death and our own mortality
- We need to consciously embrace the finite nature of time and that we will eventually run out of chips 
- You have a certain limited number of chips (hours) left in your life at any given moment

The key message is that we must recognize the scarcity and preciousness of the time we have, and be very intentional about how we choose to spend our limited hours and "chips" in this life. Our outcomes depend on the choices we make each hour with the full realization that those hours can never be replaced.



- If we could visualize the limited time we have through an enormous sand timer containing 300,000 hours, it would fundamentally change how we live our lives. We would make better decisions, focus on what really matters, and avoid wasting time on trivial things.  

- Seeing our time as finite helps provide clarity and context, allowing us to pinpoint what doesn’t matter and what should matter more. Without this visibility, we tend to believe we have unlimited time to correct bad decisions, follow dreams, and try again—when in reality, time is scarce.

- Thought leaders like Steve Jobs have emphasized living life with an awareness of death to help determine life’s most important choices. The cliché of “living each day as if it’s your last” is not practical but highlights the importance of understanding time’s scarcity. 

- To make the most of our limited time, we must identify our core values and priorities. This involves introspection to determine what we’re willing to sacrifice for and why those things matter. Our decisions and time allocation should align with these values.

- Saying “no” is key. It’s easy to say yes to things we want to do or feel obligated to do. But to budget our limited time, we must learn to decline opportunities, even good ones, that don’t match our key priorities. Success requires focus and pruning away distractions.

- Regularly reflecting on how the person we want to become would spend their time can help guide good decision making. The more we can place our “chips” on things that really matter, the more fulfilled and successful we will be. But perfection is impossible; we will always waste some time and regret certain choices. The goal is progress, not perfection.

In summary, visualizing the scarcity of our time can inspire us to live more intentionally and focus on what really matters. By identifying our core values and priorities, saying no to distractions, and making decisions that align with who we want to become, we can make the most of our precious and fleeting lives. But we must accept that some wasted time and imperfect choices are inevitable. The key is continual progress.



- The author charges very high fees for his time and speaking engagements, up to £90,000 per hour. 
- He views all of his time through a monetary lens now. If he can pay someone else to do a task instead of doing it himself, he will, so he can spend his time on more valuable things. 
- He sets a high aspirational hourly rate for himself and sticks to it. Even when he was young, he valued his time highly. 
- Looking at his time this way helps him decide what he should and shouldn’t be spending his time on. He says no as much as possible and outsources when he can. 
- How you spend your time is the most important thing. It impacts your happiness, success, mental and emotional health. Spending time on what you value is key. 
- Time is priceless. Who you are now and who you become depends on how you spend your time. Spend it wisely.
- His goals as an 18-year-old to become a “sexy millionaire” were naive. Now that he has achieved them, he realizes they were empty. He was seeking validation and trying to “fix” insecurities. 
- He realized nothing was actually broken. He was enough as he was. The stories that made him feel inadequate were wrong. 
- Letting go of the search for happiness and realizing he was enough led to actual happiness and success. The externals didn’t matter. 
- You can feel you are enough now and still strive for more. Achieving more doesn’t make you intrinsically superior or better. You are always you. 
- Success comes from within, not from what you acquire or achieve. Find purpose and meaning, not status or validation.

The key message is that how you view and spend your time is critical. Realizing you are enough as you are and not seeking external validation is key to happiness and success. Let go of societal myths that make you feel lacking or broken. Find purpose and meaning from within.



- You have inherent value regardless of external factors like your social media following, job, income, etc. These external measures of worth are social constructs and lies. 

- Feeling like you are not enough makes you chase false goals to seek external validation. Realizing you are enough allows you to pursue meaningful goals for yourself. Contentment with who you are fuels real ambition and the pursuit of things that genuinely matter to you.

- Pursuing things that matter to you, not attaining them, leads to happiness. You do not need more or less of anything to be happy. 

- Social media and popular culture spread the lie that you need to change or improve yourself in some way. But you do not need to become more or less. You are enough as you are.

- Letting go of the need to prove yourself to others allows you to live according to your own values and voice. You can accept yourself and live an authentic life.

- The truth that you are enough is the foundation for hearing your inner voice and pursuing your own purpose. Letting go of external measures of self-worth leads to self-acceptance and the ability to live meaningfully.
