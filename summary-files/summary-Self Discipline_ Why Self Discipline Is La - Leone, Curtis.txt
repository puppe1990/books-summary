 Here is a summary of the importance of self-discipline and why it is lacking in most:

• Self-discipline refers to your control over yourself, emotions, feelings, behaviors, actions, and thoughts. It allows you to avoid unhealthy excesses and stick to your goals. 

• Willpower helps you start, but self-discipline gives you the stamina to persist. Self-discipline allows you to reject instant gratification for more excellent, long-term good. You can choose your behavior with self-discipline and willpower rather than being enslaved by it.

• Self-discipline is essential for success. It helps you stay focused, avoid distractions, and achieve your goals. Without it, you quickly get sidetracked and give up on your dreams.

• Self-discipline leads to self-control, good decision making, and the ability to think before acting. It helps you complete tasks, follow plans, and overcome obstacles. 

• Self-discipline is linked to greater happiness and inner peace. Studies show self-disciplined people can better handle goal conflicts, waste less time, and make good decisions. 

• Most people lack self-discipline because:

1. They don't determine their "why" or purpose for gaining self-discipline. They need more motivation and vision.

2. They wait for the "right moment" or the "right feeling" before taking action. They make excuses rather than take action.

3. They don't take action by developing an action plan. They need to break down their goals into concrete steps. 

4. They struggle to overcome temptations and distractions. Their willpower weakens in the face of challenges.

5. They fail to motivate and nurture themselves by not rewarding small wins and milestones. They don't make self-discipline a habit.

6. They don't practice self-discipline through exercises like mindfulness, progress tracking, and willpower muscle flexing. Self-discipline is a skill that must be strengthened over time.

 

- Self-discipline is not an inbuilt ability but needs to be developed through hard work and practice. 
- Negative mental programming, environments, fear of failure, laziness, low self-esteem, lack of purpose, and giving in to temptation easily are some of the reasons our self-discipline may be lacking.
- To build self-discipline, we first need to determine our 'why' - visualize our goals, ponder why we want to be self-disciplined and achieve those goals, and think about the benefits of being disciplined and the consequences of not taking action.  
- We take action before it until we feel like it or for the rie action. Following our emotions and making excuses will only delay progress. 
- Dump all excuses like not having enough time or energy and just get started, no matter how small the steps are. Taking action and building momentum are essential.  
- Do not get discouraged by failures or imperfections. Learn from them and continue moving forward. Self-discipline is a lifelong skill that needs to be practiced every day.

In summary, to overcome our lack of enthusiasm and build self-discipline, we must determine our motivation or 'why,' take action rather than make excuses, start small but start now, learn from failures, and practice self-discipline daily as an ongoing skill. We can strengthen our self-discipline and achieve our goals with practice and persistence.

 Here's a summary of the barriers we put up for ourselves:

1. Waiting for the perfect time or emotion: We often wait for the 'right' time or mood to get started on something important. But relying on feelings or comfort is the wrong approach to developing self-discipline. We must revisit our motivation or 'why' we want to achieve something to overcome this habit.

2. Lack of decision making: Our habits are controlled by the basal ganglia part of the brain. We need to actively make decisions using our prefrontal cortex to build new habits. This initially feels uncomfortable, but sticking with it will help the new pattern become second nature. Using mantras and motivation can help in the process.

3. Making excuses: We often make excuses to procrastinate on important tasks. We must be honest about the real reasons we're avoiding something. Admitting we're lazy or lacking willpower can motivate us to act.

4. Lack of planning: We need to develop specific action plans to achieve our goals, including steps, timelines, potential issues, and strategies to address them. Reviewing and tracking progress, then making changes as needed, helps ensure we follow through.

5. Lack of accountability: Having an accountability partner or process in place, like someone calling to check on your progress, helps motivate you to stick to your action plan. Building self-discipline requires following through regularly on what you plan. In

In summary, waiting for the perfect time, relying on emotions, lack of decision making, making excuses, lack of planning, and lack of accountability are barriers we often put up that prevent us from developing self-discipline and achieving our goals. Developing motivation, specific action plans, accountability measures, and the willpower to push through discomfort can help overcome these barriers.

 

- Don't criticize yourself for mistakes. Reflect objectively and focus on resolving the issue rather than blaming yourself. 
- Expect temptations and have strategies to overcome them:

1. Detach from what tempts you (e.g., avoid places/people that encourage bad habits)
2. Envision yourself overcoming the temptation 
3. Weigh immediate gratification vs. long-term consequences
4. Distract yourself

- Motivate and nurture yourself:

1. Praise and reward yourself for accomplishments 
2. Eat healthy, balanced meals to stabilize blood sugar
3. Get 7-8 hours of sleep per night 
4. Reduce stress through exercise, sleep, etc.

- Exercises to build self-discipline:

1. Give up your seat for someone else even if you don't want to
2. Do an unpleasant chore right away instead of procrastinating

 

Take immediate action: Do chores and tasks immediately instead of postponing them. Taking action helps build self-discipline and overcome laziness. 

Make significant changes to your routine: Changing habits and routines, even briefly, helps build self-discipline and confidence in your ability to commit to change. Pick a pattern and drastically alter it for a week. It will be hard at first, but it gets easier, giving you the courage for more change.

Choose stairs over elevators: Choosing the more difficult option, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, helps build self-discipline by controlling desires and choosing what is right. It also provides health benefits.

These practices help build self-discipline gradually by giving up unnecessary desires, controlling emotions, and making tough choices. Self-discipline is about choosing what is right over what is easy.

Putting these lessons into practice is the next step. Leaving a book review on Amazon is appreciated.
